14,1,Man,"Put it down, you bitch!
"
14,1,Man,"Put the golf club down, you crazy bitch! 
"
14,1,Woman,"You motherfucker! I never should have married you! 
"
14,1,Tiger,"You're overreacting, you stupid Swedish cow!
"
14,1,Elin,"Then why-a the fuck are you getting a text-a message from some-a low-life-a hooker on Thanksgiving?!
"
14,1,Tiger,"God, shut up!  Shut! Up!  Where are my fucking pills?! 
"
14,1,Elin,"Oh yeah! Take more vitamins, Tiger! That'll help!!
"
14,1,Tiger,"Will you just listen to me?!
"
14,1,Elin,"Listen to this-a! 
"
14,1,Tiger,"Aaaah!  You fucking whore!
"
14,1,Elin,"Oh where the fuck do ya think-a you're going?!
"
14,1,Tiger,"I'm getting the fuck away from you! 
"
14,1,Elin,"Open the door, you motherfucker! 
"
14,1,Cartman,"Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! 
"
14,1,Stan,"What are you guys doing?
"
14,1,Cartman,"Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. 
"
14,1,Tiger,"D'Aaaah! Fuck you, cunt!
"
14,1,Cartman,"Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! 
"
14,1,Tiger,"Aw, look what you did, you crazy bitch!
"
14,1,Elin,"It serves you right, you cheating turd! 
"
14,1,Cartman,"Oh dude, was that a combo move?
"
14,1,Kenny,"(Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)
"
14,1,Cartman,"Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
"
14,1,Kyle,"Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
"
14,1,Cartman,"Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
"
14,1,Chairman,"I've gathered you together here because you are the best minds our country has to offer. As you've all seen on the news, our country is facing a major crisis, and we need to find out what's causing it.  Why? Why are rich successful men suddenly going out and trying to have sex with lots of women?
"
14,1,Expert 1,"Tiger Woods was only the most prevalent, but our data shows that the numbers are growing. David Letterman and before that, Bill Clinton. There's a pattern here, people.
"
14,1,Expert 2,"Why would a man who's famous and makes tons of money use that and have sex with lots of different women? 
"
14,1,Chairman,"Aand these rich celebrities have perfectly good wives at home. Why would they even think of sex with others? Dammit!  I want answers!
"
14,1,Expert 3,"We believe that it may be an outbreak of sex addiction, sir.
"
14,1,Chairman,"Sex awhowho?
"
14,1,Expert 4,"It's a new phenomena we don't completely understand yet, but it... seems to make people... different. Of course, we all know the normal healthy male thinks only of sex occasionally and has no desire for sex with multiple partners. 
"
14,1,Expert 5,"Definitely true.
"
14,1,Chairman,"Yes, we all know that, go on.
"
14,1,Expert 4,"But in the sex addict, their entire lives are consumed with thoughts of wanting more and more. The mere sight of an attractive woman could... can make them think about sex with her.
"
14,1,Expert 6,"But what about love? How could tons of fame and money make you forget about love? 
"
14,1,Chairman,"What could be causing this outbreak of sexual addiction?
"
14,1,Expert 7,"It could be caused by something in the water supply. Uh, perhaps even by - global warming.
"
14,1,Expert 8,"Or cooling.
"
14,1,Expert 9,"Yes
"
14,1,Expert 7,"If.so, then the disease could start to affect our children
"
14,1,Chairman,"That does it!  I want health screening at all our nation's schools! We need to find out if any young people might be carrying this disease.
"
14,1,Expert 9,"Good afternoon, students. We are going to be a doing a health screening today. It won't take long, it'll be relatively painless, but we need to see if any students are showing... symptoms.  I'n a moment, I'm going to show you a suggestive picture.  And then I'm going to ask you a question about that picture. Alright, ready? Here we go. 
"
14,1,The class,"Oh! Wow. Ohhh.
"
14,1,Kenny,"(Woo hoo!)
"
14,1,Kyle,"Jesus, dude.
"
14,1,Butters,"Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
"
14,1,Expert 9,"Please just study the picture the best you can, students. I'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided.
"
14,1,Butters,"I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
"
14,1,Expert 9,"Okay, very good.  Now, what color... was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand? Write down your answer, please: what color was the handkerchief... in the nice lady's hand?
"
14,1,Butters,"Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
"
14,1,Expert 9,"Very good, turn your answers over please. 
"
14,1,Butters,"Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
"
14,1,Expert 9,"Alright, now, who answered that the handkerchief was... yellow?  Very good, very good indeed. Now I'd like to see who answered ""What handkerchief?""  A-ha! You three boys, please come with me. 
"
14,1,Kyle,"I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
"
14,1,Kenny,"(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)
"
14,1,Expert 9,"I'm sorry boys, but I'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction.
"
14,1,Kyle,"What?!
"
14,1,Butters,"Oh no!
"
14,1,Kenny,"(Who fuckin' cares?)
"
14,1,Expert 9,"We're gonna have to send you home, I'm afraid.
"
14,1,Kyle,"Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?
"
14,1,Expert 9,"Our nice-lady-with-the-handkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough. I'm sorry, but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal, well-adjusted students.
"
14,1,Butters,"It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
"
14,1,Kyle,"So what happens to us now?
"
14,1,Expert 9,"A life of desperation and anguish, I'm afraid. Your addiction will start off slowly - magazines, Internet sites - but then, as you keep chasing your high your tastes will get more and more dangerous. Most likely you'll end up going the way of David Carradine and Michael Hutchence: autoerotic asphyxiation.
"
14,1,Kenny,"(Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?)
"
14,1,Expert 9,"I don't want to go into too much detail but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome.
"
14,1,Kenny,"(Really??)
"
14,1,Butters,"Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
"
14,1,Chairman,"Ladies and gentlemen, for the past several days we've been screening our nation's schools for signs of sex addiction. The results of our tests are troubling to say the least. Dr. Tonton?
"
14,1,Dr. Tonton,"In fourth graders, five percent of male students were found to be sex addicts. By sixth grade the number goes up to thirty percent. At high schools, nearly ninety-one percent of male students answered, ""What handkerchief?""
"
14,1,Chairman,"We're facing a sex addiction epidemic in our country. Young people all over America are infected, and at extreme risk to themselves and to the people around them.  They're leading lives of secret pain.
"
14,1,Reporter 1,"And so these infected boys will soon be secretly wishing they could be having sex all the time with lots of different people?
"
14,1,Chairman,"It appears so.
"
14,1,Reporter 1,"The poor bastards!
"
14,1,Reporter 2,"But what about us normal healthy adults? Are we at risk of exposure?
"
14,1,Chairman,"We don't believe so. In adult males, for whatever reason, sex addiction only seems to be problematic amongst rich successful celebrities.  However, we are still collecting data, and all-
"
14,1,Randy,"Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
"
14,1,Chairman,"-answers which we all desire.  Whatever is causing this outbreak, we guarantee we will find it! 
"
14,1,Mrs. McCormick,"Kenny, it's time for dinner!  Kenny?  AAAA!
"
14,1,Priest,"Sunset and Evening Star, and one clear call for me, and may their be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea.
"
14,1,Kyle,"Oh God, it's true.
"
14,1,Priest,"But such a tide as moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam, when that which drew from out the boundless deep t-
"
14,1,Butters,"There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
"
14,1,Kyle,"Butters! Butters, stop it!
"
14,1,Butters,"But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
"
14,1,Kyle,"Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!
"
14,1,Butters,"No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
"
14,1,Kyle,"No! Butters, stop! 
"
14,1,Butters,"Haah! Leave me alone! 
"
14,1,Kyle,"Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!
"
14,1,Commentator,"Tiger... lines up his drive. He'll be hoping for a birdie here. Concentration is key.
"
14,1,Elin,"You motherfucker! I never should have married you! 
"
14,1,Tiger,"Aaagh! Goddamnit, stop it! 
"
14,1,Elin,"How many women did you fuck-a?! How many?!
"
14,1,Stan,"Aw dude, I clocked you!
"
14,1,Cartman,"I told you this game was sweet, dude.
"
14,1,Stan,"Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 
"
14,1,Cartman,"Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
"
14,1,Stan,"Hit A and X together.
"
14,1,Announcer,"Round 2. Fight!! 
"
14,1,Cartman,"Oh, you're going down, Elin!
"
14,1,Stan,"I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
"
14,1,Announcer,"Pre-nup power-up. 
"
14,1,Cartman,"Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
"
14,1,Therapist,"All right, sex addicts. What other destructive behaviors that we engaged in that led to our ultimate downfall?  Anyone have another example? Let's see, how about... David!
"
14,1,David Letterman,"Haha, Oh, ahh, having sex with employees.
"
14,1,Therapist,"""Sex with employees."" Definitely a danger there. What else? Uh, Mr. Clinton.
"
14,1,Bill Clinton,"Putting cigars in girls' vaginas?
"
14,1,Therapist,"Very good, Billy.  ""cigars in vaginas."" Not the best idea there.
"
14,1,Charlie Sheen,"Watching Internet porn all day every day?
"
14,1,Therapist,"Spot on, Charlie Sheen! Excessive  ""Internet porn."" Now, the reason we are making this list is that we have new members today. I want you all to welcome Kyle and Bummers. The men all turn to look at the boys, who are seated in the last row.
"
14,1,Kyle,"Hello?
"
14,1,The men,"Hey Kyle, hi Kyle.
"
14,1,Therapist,"And would you care to share your stories with us, boys?
"
14,1,Kyle,"Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
"
14,1,Bill Clinton,"Does your mom have big tits?
"
14,1,Therapist,"Billy!
"
14,1,Bill Clinton,"Sorry...
"
14,1,Butters,"Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
"
14,1,Ben Roethlisberger,"I heard that.
"
14,1,Butters,"I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
"
14,1,Therapist,"Mr. Duchovny, please stop jerking off!
"
14,1,David Duchovny,"Aw, gee whiz!
"
14,1,Expert 4,"To better understand the sex addiction outbreak, we've been running tests on chimpanzees.  You can see that this entire community of specimens are getting along normally, some pairing off, others on their own, but now see this chimp here.  An average adult normal male blending in seamlessly with the others. Now watch. We're going to give it a lot of money.  Go ahead. 
"
14,1,Chairman,"My God...
"
14,1,Expert 4,"Yes...  The subject is now isolated and shunned.
"
14,1,Chairman,"Incredible. And, and what's it doing now?
"
14,1,Expert 4,"Making a public apology on its talk show. 
"
14,1,Therapist,"Alrighty. Now, we all know the destructive behaviors that got us into this predicament, don't we? What is the main thing we've all learned to avoid?  Yes, Tiger?
"
14,1,Tiger Woods,"Avoid drugs? And alcohol?
"
14,1,The other men,"Auugh!
"
14,1,Therapist,"No, no, Tiger, you still aren't getting it.  In order to make sure we are no longer destroying our lives with any of these behaviors, we must avoid... anyone? Avoid getting... anyone?
"
14,1,Michael Douglas,"Caught.
"
14,1,Therapist,"Yes, Michael Douglas! Everyone!
"
14,1,The Men,"Getting caught.
"
14,1,Therapist,"Very good! You are all here in therapy  because you got caught! So how do we avoid getting caught? Ben Rothlisberger?
"
14,1,Ben Rothlisberger,"Don't screw girls in the public bathrooms?
"
14,1,David Letterman,"When they uh ask you for money, pay them.
"
14,1,Therapist,"Good, yes!
"
14,1,Kyle,"Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. 
"
14,1,Bill Clinton,"What the fuck are you talkin' about?
"
14,1,Kyle,"Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. 
"
14,1,Therapist,"Yeah, it's me. We've got a turd in the punch bowl. I repeat, we have a turd in the punch bowl.
"
14,1,Chairman,"Mr. President, in every test the results were the same. The monkeys who were given cash always acted out their sexual addiction to dangerous levels. It appears that money has a direct effect on the virus's ability to develop.
"
14,1,Obama,"So we must keep our nation's youth away from money and success.
"
14,1,Chairman,"No good, Mr. President. Because we've learned that sex addicts will find ways to make money and become successful in order to feed their addiction.
"
14,1,Obama,"You mean boys will start working towards being rich and successful just so they can one day have sex with lots of women??
"
14,1,Chairman,"Yes. That's why we decided to look at the cash itself for clues! We tried to find something in the hundred dollar bill that could explain why this is happening now. Then we looked at the backside, and found this.  Independence Hall.
"
14,1,Obama,"The birthplace of our country.
"
14,1,Chairman,"We believe something is happening in Independence Hall that gives money its power over men.
"
14,1,Obama,"Independence Hall... Independence Day... Aliens... Gentlemen, I might know what's causing the sex addiction outbreak. This is highly classified, but... in 1947 a flying saucer was discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. Two deceased alien bodies were recovered and hidden from public knowledge. They carried... a virus with them. A virus that only barely stopped from spreading all over the country.
"
14,1,Chairman,"And you think that these aliens... could be back with a new virus? One originating from Independence Hall causing rich successful men to have sex with lots of women?!
"
14,1,Obama,"It's the only explanation that makes any sense. 
"
14,1,Tiger,"I want to say that I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior. I know that I have severely disappointed all of you. Some have speculated that my wife somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving Night. It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. She has shown nothing but grace and poise-
"
14,1,Elin,"You motherfucker!
"
14,1,Tiger,"Oh no!
"
14,1,Elin,"I should have never married  youuu! 
"
14,1,Tiger,"Agh! Stop it!
"
14,1,Elin,"A porn star?! You screwed a porn star?! 
"
14,1,Cartman,"Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
"
14,1,Stan,"Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.
"
14,1,Kyle,"Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
"
14,1,Therapist,"We are on our way to help take of your diseases once and for all!
"
14,1,Butters,"Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
"
14,1,Therapist,"Don't worry, as soon as it's dead everything will make sense.
"
14,1,Kyle,"...As soon as what's dead? 
"
14,1,Therapist,"The infected alien that they just discovered is hiding out at Independence Hall!
"
14,1,SWAT Officer 1,"Entrance is clear, Mr. President. 
"
14,1,Chairman,"Mr. President, you aren't safe here. Let us handle this.
"
14,1,SWAT Officer 2,"Right side clear!
"
14,1,Expert 4,"We must be careful. The alien could have cast some kind of spell of invisibility.
"
14,1,Obama,"Which would mean that the alien is also a wizard.
"
14,1,Expert 10,"Yes! It explains everything! A wizard alien would be able to cast a spell on our species, causing all the men to become sex addicts.
"
14,1,Obama,"Enough! We need to find the wizard alien and break his spell.
"
14,1,SWAT Officer 2,"Okay okay alright alright, hang, hang on guys. I mean, come on, this is getting a little ridiculous. Wizard aliens? We all know what's going on here, don't we? Whenever a story breaks about some rich famous guy going around and having sex with tons of girls, we all wanna act like we don't understand it, but we do. We're guys, you know? Our brains are wired to strive to be the alpha male and get all the women we can.  I mean, look where we are. Even, even Benjamin Franklin screwed everything that moved. Because he could. We don't have to condone what these rich, famous people do, but... we can at least admit that, given the same temptations and opportunities that somebody like Tiger Woods has, a lot of us guys might do somethin' similar. 
"
14,1,Obama,"We have a turd in the punch bowl.
"
14,1,Secret Service Agent,"Turd in the punch bowl. 
"
14,1,SWAT Officer 2,"Hey, what are you doin- No. No, come on.  Where are you takin' me?
"
14,1,News 4 Reporter,"Ten city blocks have been shut down because an alien is believed to have taken refuge here in Independence Hall. By all accounts, the alien is also a wizard, who could very easily be the cause of the outbreak of sex addiction in our country. 
"
14,1,SWAT Officer 3,"Mr. President, here they are. 
"
14,1,Therapist,"This is the boy I told you about. And his friend, Bummers.
"
14,1,Chairman,"Son, we were told that you think sex addiction can be controlled. That it just takes restraint. Is that true?
"
14,1,Kyle,"I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
"
14,1,Chairman,"A-mazing. Then the wizard alien spell might not have any power over him! He could draw the bastard out!
"
14,1,Obama,"Quick, give that boy a gun! 
"
14,1,Kyle,"What?
"
14,1,SWAT Officer 3,"You'd better take one too. 
"
14,1,Obama,"Alright, everyone to the stairwell. The bastard's gotta be upstairs. 
"
14,1,Kyle,"What bastard?
"
14,1,Obama,"The alien wizard hiding out here! Come on, we've got tuh- 
"
14,1,Chairman,"The hell was that?
"
14,1,SWAT Officer 4,"I got a baaad feelin' about this. 
"
14,1,Dr. Tonton,"Oh my God there it is!
"
14,1,Chairman,"It's the alien wizard! It's gonna get you boys! Shoot it! 
"
14,1,Obama,"Shoot it boys!
"
14,1,Expert 6,"You have to shoot it! 
"
14,1,Chairman,"Shoot it again, it's still alive! 
"
14,1,SWAT Officer 5,"You gotta reload! 
"
14,1,Expert 4,"Keep firing, boys! Shoot it in the heart! 
"
14,1,Obama,"Keep shooting it!
"
14,1,Expert 11,"Shoot him in his blabber mouth! 
"
14,1,Chairman,"My God, they've done it!
"
14,1,Bill Clinton,"Look! The sex addiction! It's leavin' my body!
"
14,1,David Letterman,"I can feel it! I'm free!
"
14,1,Another addict,"We are healed!
"
14,1,Obama,"We watched... as sex addiction ran rampant through our country. It devastated families. But once again, our great country has risen up as one. The wizard alien... is dead. Sex addiction is no more. And if a rich celebrity is caught again trying to screw lots of women, we will know it isn't because men are just like that, it's because a wizard alien has cast his mighty spell. 
"
14,1,Randy,"Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? 
"
14,1,News 4 Reporter,"We are now with the young boys who helped stop the alien. Boys, how does it feel to be free of your illness?
"
14,1,Kyle,"I guess it... feels great. Thanks. 
"
14,1,Butters,"Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
"
14,1,Tiger,"I am so happy that I am cured, and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife. Now I can be faithful. And my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys.  So I officially announce my return to golf.
"
14,1,Cartman,"What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
"
14,1,Stan,"Yeah, where's all the fighting?
"
14,1,Cartman,"Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
"
14,1,Stan,"Yeah, golf is stupid again. 
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Aww, books? God, I hate those!
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. 
"
14,2,Cartman,"Oh really? Sweet.
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"It's called The Catcher In The Rye, and it has some very... risqué parts... 
"
14,2,Stan,"All right!
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"...and strong vulgar language...
"
14,2,Kenny,"(Awesome, dude!)
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Oho man, I can't wait!
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-
"
14,2,Cartman,"No on, come on, let's read it now!
"
14,2,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! 
"
14,2,Cartman,"Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"You will read it at home,  and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!
"
14,2,Class,"Awww!
"
14,2,Stan,"Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
"
14,2,Kyle,"No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.
"
14,2,Stan,"I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said ""shit"" and ""fuck"" a few times.
"
14,2,Kyle,"I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 
"
14,2,Cartman,"Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, ""alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming,"" and then after like a hundred pages I was like ""alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end,"" and then I got to the last page, and I was all ""the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!""
"
14,2,Kyle,"Why the hell was this book banned?!
"
14,2,Cartman,"They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 
"
14,2,Kenny,"(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)
"
14,2,Cartman,"We know, we were just saying that.
"
14,2,Stan,"Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
"
14,2,Butters,"Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
"
14,2,Stephen,"John Lennon's dead, Butters.
"
14,2,Butters,"Aww. Dangit. 
"
14,2,Kyle,"Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
"
14,2,Cartman,"It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
"
14,2,Stan,"Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 
"
14,2,Cartman,"Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
"
14,2,Kyle,"Yeah, sweet.
"
14,2,Kenny,"(Awesome.)
"
14,2,Kyle,"The Tale of... 
"
14,2,Cartman,"The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
"
14,2,Kenny,"(No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)
"
14,2,Kyle,"Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
"
14,2,Cartman,"It was a... a warm spring morning. 
"
14,2,Sharon,"""The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs""?  ""It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his""...  Ew. ""He took a...""  What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! ""He then grabbed his dog's""  Ehohoh, oh my God! ""Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered""  Nooo! Nooo!  Noho! Nooo! 
"
14,2,Sharon,"Randy?  Randy! Randy, you need to read this!
"
14,2,Randy,"Read what?
"
14,2,Sharon,"This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!
"
14,2,Randy,"So?
"
14,2,Sharon,"Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good!
"
14,2,Randy,"Huh?
"
14,2,Sharon,"I mean it's disgusting.  It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!
"
14,2,Randy,"""It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-"" Ew, Sharon, gross!
"
14,2,Sharon,"Nono, just keep reading.
"
14,2,Randy,"""He took a- and then-"" Oh, man. Oh, this- 
"
14,2,Sharon,"I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.
"
14,2,Randy,"Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!
"
14,2,Sharon,"Randy please! You've got to listen to me!
"
14,2,Randy,"""Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-"" What? ""He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-""  ""That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest."" Oh... Oh, man.
"
14,2,Sharon,"Well?
"
14,2,Randy,"It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
"
14,2,Sharon,"Right? It's not just me.
"
14,2,Randy,"No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!
"
14,2,Sharon,"What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.
"
14,2,Randy,"NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
"
14,2,Stan,"Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!
"
14,2,Cartman,"...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
"
14,2,Stan,"Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
"
14,2,Kyle,"Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
"
14,2,Cartman,"And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
"
14,2,Stan,"Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
"
14,2,Cartman,"Butters, what are you up to?
"
14,2,Butters,"Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
"
14,2,Kim,"Today my sisters and I are gonna have to wash something. It's gonna blow!
"
14,2,Butters,"Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
"
14,2,Stan,"Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!
"
14,2,Butters,"I am?
"
14,2,Cartman,"Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
"
14,2,Butters,"Oh no. Which book was that?
"
14,2,Cartman,"Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
"
14,2,Butters,"I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
"
14,2,Sharon,"Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.
"
14,2,Sheila,"We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.
"
14,2,Stan,"Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 
"
14,2,Cartman,"That's right.
"
14,2,Randy,"Butters? Is that true?
"
14,2,Butters,"Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
"
14,2,Gerald,"Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.
"
14,2,Butters,"Huh?
"
14,2,Kyle,"What? 
"
14,2,Gerald,"Yeah, it's really amazing.
"
14,2,Butters,"Oh, thanks.
"
14,2,Sheila,"We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.
"
14,2,Mr. Needlebaum,"Mr. Butters, we would like to offer you a deal for first publishing rights to your brilliant novel.
"
14,2,Stan,"Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!
"
14,2,Kyle,"Yeah, we wrote that!
"
14,2,Randy,"Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.
"
14,2,Kyle,"No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
"
14,2,Butters,"I wrote that. 
"
14,2,Stephen,"Really amazing.
"
14,2,Stan,"What? Hey! 
"
14,2,News Anchor,"It is being called the most disgusting, foul, sickening book ever written, and it is also being called ""literary genius."" The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this weekend, and so far no one has been able to get through the first paragraph without vomiting.
"
14,2,News Anchor,"The book has already sold millions of copies worldwide aaand has been translated into twenty six languages.
"
14,2,News Anchor,"The book is changing the literary world. And it is all thanks... to Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch. 
"
14,2,Clyde,"Hey, here he comes!
"
14,2,Mr. Adler,"Amazing book, Butters. 
"
14,2,Butters,"Thank you! 
"
14,2,Mrs. Streibel,"You've changed my life, young man.
"
14,2,Butters,"That's nice. 
"
14,2,Cartman,"Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
14,2,Butters,"Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?
"
14,2,Kyle,"Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
"
14,2,Butters,"But, you told me I did!
"
14,2,Stan,"Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! 
"
14,2,Red,"Hey hey, you leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist.
"
14,2,Lola,"He's so brooding and full of angst.
"
14,2,Butters,"Yeah, I'm broooding.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
"
14,2,Rebecca,"Oh God, you guys are pathetic!
"
14,2,Lola,"Yeah, get a life and stop mooching off others' success for once. 
"
14,2,Stan,"God-damnit!
"
14,2,Kyle,"Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
"
14,2,Butters,"No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
"
14,2,Cartman,"That inconsiderate jerk!
"
14,2,Announcer,"Today on Today: We meet the author of the book that has swept the nation, and has now spawned TV's most popular game show, ""How Long Can You Listen To Scrotie McBoogerballs On Audiobook""  ""And Not Vomit?""  The book is full of disgusting words and acts, including Sarah Jessica Parker, who is mentioned four hundred and sixty-five times.  Matthew Broderick, are you upset your wife is made fun of so much in the book?
"
14,2,Broderick,"Well, obviously. I just think it's wrong to make fun of anybody's physical appearance. My wife is a beautiful woman and I know that most people agree with me.
"
14,2,Announcer,"Uh huh, and Matthew, how come a transvestite donkey witch is standing next to you, and why is it wearing a dress? 
"
14,2,Matt Lauer,"Joining us now is the author of the book, Leopold Stotch, along with his parents.
"
14,2,Stephen,"Hello Matt
"
14,2,Linda,"Hi everyone.
"
14,2,Matt Lauer,"You must be pretty proud of your son.
"
14,2,Stephen,"Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented.
"
14,2,Meredith Vieira,"And we also learned that your son is grounded. Is that correct?
"
14,2,Stephen,"Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course.
"
14,2,Butters,"I have to come right to my room after school.
"
14,2,Stephen,"But we are very very proud nonetheless.
"
14,2,Al Roker,"Young man, now that you are a respected author, have you met any famous people?
"
14,2,Butters,"Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
"
14,2,Matt Lauer,"All right, uh, yeah huh. Butters, my favorite part of your novel was when Scrotie McBoogerballs slid his head up into the horse's  Sorry, I uh, was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested?
"
14,2,Butters,"Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
"
14,2,Meredith Vieira,"Is that why the doctor character pulls out all the strings? 
"
14,2,Al Roker,"Little boy, are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone, like when that guy tried to shoot Ronald Reagan after reading The Catcher in the Rye?
"
14,2,Butters,"Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.
"
14,2,Al Roker,"Ronald Reagan is dead now, Butters.
"
14,2,Butters,"Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit.
"
14,2,Stan,"More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
"
14,2,Assemblyman 1,"That's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes.
"
14,2,Cartman,"There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
"
14,2,Assemblyman 2,"You just fail to understand what the author meant.
"
14,2,Kyle,"The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
"
14,2,Assemblyman 3,"No, no no, that's such a simplistic view.
"
14,2,Stan,"Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
"
14,2,Assemblywoman 1,"Oh, so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of Sarah Jessica Parker for no reason?
"
14,2,Kyle,"Yes!
"
14,2,Assemblywoman 1,"But what would be the point?
"
14,2,Cartman,"There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
"
14,2,Assemblywoman 2,"No writer would take the time to make fun of Sarah Jessica Parker just because they think she's ugly.
"
14,2,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","Yes they would!
"
14,2,Assemblywoman 2,"It is because Miss Jessica Parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class.
"
14,2,Stan,"What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!
"
14,2,Assemblyman 2,"Boys, this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country.
"
14,2,Stan,"What?
"
14,2,Assemblywoman 2,"Wait, Scrotie McBoogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature!
"
14,2,Assemblyman 2,"What book did you read?!
"
14,2,Stan,"There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!
"
14,2,Assemblyman 4,"Ohohh yeah, then why did Sarah Jessica Parker's butt-cheese end up in Scrotie's milkshake? 
"
14,2,Field Reporter,"Breaking news from acclaimed author Leopold Stotch. The artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller. We got a statement from the writer, who is still grounded in his room. 
"
14,2,Field Reporter,"Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?
"
14,2,Butters,"Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
"
14,2,Field Reporter,"Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book?
"
14,2,Butters,"Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
"
14,2,Stephen,"Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!
"
14,2,Butters,"Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 
"
14,2,Stan,"I can't believe they won't ban our book!
"
14,2,Kyle,"I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
"
14,2,Kenny,"(It's fucking disgusting!)
"
14,2,Cartman,"All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.
"
14,2,Kyle,"What?! 
"
14,2,Cartman,"Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
"
14,2,Kyle,"Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! 
"
14,2,Cartman,"Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.
"
14,2,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 
"
14,2,Cartman,"Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
"
14,2,Kenny,"(Okay.)
"
14,2,Cartman,"Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. 
"
14,2,Matt,"Well, the day has finally arrived. The eagerly awaited second novel from the author of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently, bookstores are jammed.
"
14,2,Meredith,"Al, how is it out there?
"
14,2,Al,"I don't know if you could see this, guys, but uh, the line stretches all the way around the block. People waiting for their turn to get inside the bookstore and read the novel.  And they brought trash bags and buckets to throw up in. Just a festive atmosphere here, Matt and Meredith.
"
14,2,Meredith,"Well, we've got our vomit buckets ready too, because coming up, a very special in-studio treat.
"
14,2,Matt,"That's right, we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio. Na-now we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic, obscene novel of all time, so... brace yourselves for some very harsh language. Take it away Morgan Freeman.
"
14,2,Morgan Freeman,"The Poop That Took A Pee Chapter 1: Douglas had to poop. His butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly. There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, ""I need to poop."" ""Okay,"" Rebecca replied, ""I like poop."" Douglas squatted down  over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener.  Chapter 2...
"
14,2,Cartman,"See any hunters yet?
"
14,2,Kenny,"(Not yet) 
"
14,2,Cartman,"Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
"
14,2,Kyle,"Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!
"
14,2,Kenny,"(Huh?)
"
14,2,Kyle,"Butters wrote a second book!
"
14,2,Cartman,"So what?
"
14,2,Stan,"So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
"
14,2,Kyle,"We can get people to believe us now!
"
14,2,Cartman,"Oh dude, sweet! 
"
14,2,Morgan Freeman,"""Why are we here?"" Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener, in a long, thin strip. It was... wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all.
"
14,2,Shopper 1,"""The pee he got on the woman's leg, and she screamed, pooping out her boobs.""
"
14,2,Shopper 2,"""And so when the pee got mixed with the poop, it smelled like a butt.""
"
14,2,Stan,"Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 
"
14,2,Cartman,"People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
"
14,2,Shopper 3,"Are you reading this, Marsha? What do you think?
"
14,2,Marsha,"So far I think it's, it's incredible! Ih, it might be better than his first book.
"
14,2,Shopper 4,"I agree. It wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots.
"
14,2,Cartman,"What?!
"
14,2,Stan,"You can't be serious! You people like this?!
"
14,2,Shopper 5,"Some of the imagery is unbelievable
"
14,2,Kyle,"A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
"
14,2,Shopper 6,"Says you! You must be a pro-life nut, huh?  Didn't like what the book had to say?
"
14,2,Marsha,"What are you talking about? This book is as pro-life as it gets!
"
14,2,Cartman,"Oh come on!
"
14,2,Stan,"God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
"
14,2,Shopper 7,"""And the poop and the pee lived happily every after. The end.""  Kill the phonies. Kill the phonies!
"
14,2,Kim,"Today my sisters and I are gonna shop for underwear.
"
14,2,The Kardashians,"Yaaay!
"
14,2,Male Guest,"Can I go with you girls? 
"
14,2,News Anchor 2,"Our nation is still reeling from the tragic deaths of the Kardashians. The shooter claims he was driven to commit the slaughter immediately after reading The Poop That Took A Pee by Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch. It's all over. The Kardiashians..  wiped out. In the blink of an eye. All because one little PRICK... had to go and write a book.
"
14,2,News Anchor 2,"Leopold Stotch... I HOPE THEY BURY YOU! ...YOU EVIL FUCK! 
"
14,2,Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
"
14,2,Butters,"I know.
"
14,2,Stan,"They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
"
14,2,Butters,"You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
"
14,2,Kyle,"Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
"
14,2,Stan,"Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
"
14,2,Butters,"Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
"
14,2,Cartman,"That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
"
14,2,Butters,"What?
"
14,2,Cartman,"You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
"
14,2,Butters,"What?! Oh no!
"
14,2,Cartman,"Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. 
"
14,2,Butters,"Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 
"
14,3,Group,"Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
"
14,3,Coach,"You seem to have a stomach ache every time we do drills and exercises.
"
14,3,Cartman,"I know, it sucks. 
"
14,3,Coach,"Alright kids, practice is over for today.
"
14,3,Cartman,"KFC!! 
"
14,3,Cartman,"Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
"
14,3,Kyle,"Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
"
14,3,Stan,"Hey it looks different.
"
14,3,Randy,"Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?
"
14,3,Customer,"Oh, it's not a KFC anymore. It's a medicinal marijuana dispensary. 
"
14,3,Stan,"A what?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
"
14,3,Kyle,"So where's the KFC now?
"
14,3,Randy,"Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. 
"
14,3,Clerk,"Can I help you sir?
"
14,3,Randy,"Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?
"
14,3,Clerk,"Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.
"
14,3,Randy,"Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?
"
14,3,Clerk,"Sure. New state laws say it's okay.
"
14,3,Randy,"Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!
"
14,3,Clerk,"Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.
"
14,3,Randy,"My huh?
"
14,3,Clerk,"Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.
"
14,3,Randy,"Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! 
"
14,3,Stan,"What'd they say?
"
14,3,Randy,"KFC's gone, been replaced.
"
14,3,Cartman,"They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
"
14,3,Randy,"Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. 
"
14,3,Stan,"The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.
"
14,3,Randy,"I gotta get to the doctor! 
"
14,3,Kyle,"...so no KFC?
"
14,3,Cartman,"This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"Well Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal.
"
14,3,Randy,"All right!
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"Yep, you check out fine.
"
14,3,Randy,"That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"For what?
"
14,3,Randy,"Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana.
"
14,3,Randy,"But you said I'm totally healthy!
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!
"
14,3,Randy,"...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.
"
14,3,Randy,"Yeah, but what's the quickest way?
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"The what?
"
14,3,Randy,"Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Mom, drive faster!
"
14,3,Liane,"The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
"
14,3,Liane,"Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?
"
14,3,Cartman,"WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
"
14,3,Liane,"Alright honey, let's take it easy.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Fuck you!
"
14,3,Cartman,"No! No, what's going on?!  Move aside! 
"
14,3,Worker 1,"It's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there.
"
14,3,Cartman,"No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
"
14,3,Worker 1,"Yeah, well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low-income areas.
"
14,3,Cartman,"You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
"
14,3,Worker 2,"No you don't get it, kid. KFCs were only in low-income areas. In the entire state of Colorado, Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Nooooooooo-! 
"
14,3,Stan,"Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
"
14,3,Randy,"Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. 
"
14,3,Clerk 2,"Can I help you?
"
14,3,Cartman,"I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. 
"
14,3,Clerk 2,"Alright, sign your name on the release form and put down the time-
"
14,3,Cartman,"Really?
"
14,3,Clerk 2,"-your birth year. and we'll get you through the next twenty-four hours. 
"
14,3,Cartman,"Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that's KFC gravy!  You have KFC! Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!
"
14,3,Clerk 2,"This is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
"
14,3,Clerk 2,"If you don't want it, that's fine-
"
14,3,Cartman,"NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.
"
14,3,Randy,"""Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers."" Alright.  ""Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are...""  ""slow-growing and can take years to develop."" Dammit.  ""Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive."" Oh this is good. ""There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation"" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?
"
14,3,Randy,"Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!
"
14,3,Sharon,"Wha... WAAAAA! 
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer.
"
14,3,Randy,"SCORE! 
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-
"
14,3,Randy,"Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"Your prescription for what?
"
14,3,Randy,"Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...
"
14,3,Randy,"One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
"
14,3,Randy,"Uh that is nice! That is nice!
"
14,3,Jimbo,"Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls!
"
14,3,Randy,"I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?
"
14,3,Jimbo,"No, I mean, your actual balls!
"
14,3,Randy,"Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! 
"
14,3,Tough Boy 1,"Hey kid, they say you're looking for some KFC.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Yeah. Who isn't?
"
14,3,Tough Boy 1,"Yeah well uh, we got some. Over at Billy Miller's house.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Billy Miller? Seriously??
"
14,3,Billy,"Ahhh Eric Cartman, right?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Tommy said you have some KFC.
"
14,3,Billy,"Suuure.  Jessie. 
"
14,3,Cartman,"Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!
"
14,3,Billy,"I have my sources. That'll be $85.
"
14,3,Cartman,"85 bucks?? I don't have that! 
"
14,3,Billy,"Hold on, hold on.  You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up.
"
14,3,Cartman,"How much KFC are we talking?
"
14,3,Billy,"Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Holy fuck, dude.
"
14,3,Billy,"I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
"
14,3,Billy,"Excellent.
"
14,3,Randy,"Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 
"
14,3,Cartman,"Are you Teabag?
"
14,3,Teabag,"Maybe I am. Who's askin'?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
"
14,3,Teabag,"Oh, I got the hookup. Question is, you got the money?  Alright, we're in biz.  It's all there, man.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Extra crispy? 
"
14,3,Teabag,"'Course, man, I ain't no fool.
"
14,3,Cartman,"You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
"
14,3,Teabag,"Awww, it's all the same shit, man.
"
14,3,Cartman,"IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! 
"
14,3,Teabag,"Okay okay I'm sorry, oh... 
"
14,3,Cartman,"You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
"
14,3,Teabag,"I'll take back the gravy.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!
"
14,3,Teabag,"AAAH please. Please, I'm sorry! Take your money back! Take the KFC too! 
"
14,3,Barbrady,"What's going on back there?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Nothin', it's cool.
"
14,3,Jimbo,"Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned.
"
14,3,Randy,"Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
"
14,3,Nelson,"Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.
"
14,3,Randy,"No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.
"
14,3,Player 1,"Aw some on, just give us a little bit.
"
14,3,Player 2,"Yeah.
"
14,3,Randy,"Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em.
"
14,3,Nelson,"Women love huge balls?
"
14,3,Randy,"Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going ""whaaa?"" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. 
"
14,3,Woman 1,"Travis, did you take out the garba-whaaa? 
"
14,3,Randy,"See?
"
14,3,Billy,"Cartman my boy, you got the stuff?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money. 
"
14,3,Billy,"Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 
"
14,3,Billy,"That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little ""arrangement"" with the Colonel himself.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
"
14,3,Billy,"That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
"
14,3,Billy,"Excellent.
"
14,3,Nurse,"Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in. 
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"What the hell is going on?
"
14,3,Nurse,"Doctor?
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.
"
14,3,Jimbo,"Heh, I am stoned off my ass!
"
14,3,Player 3,"I'm stoned off my balls! 
"
14,3,Randy,"Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
"
14,3,Woman 2,"Wow. Those guys have nice balls.
"
14,3,Woman 3,"Wish my man had balls like those.
"
14,3,Woman 2,"Mmm.
"
14,3,The Colonel,"Our entire production is headquartered here, boys. We move over sixteen tons of chicken every month. Of course, with the new laws in Colorado my business has taken quite a hit. I'm worried other states might follow suit.
"
14,3,Tommy,"We know, Colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. We just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key?
"
14,3,Cartman,"I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
"
14,3,The Colonel,"I like you, Eric. There's no lying in you. Unfortunately, I don't feel the same about your friend. Cartman: Who? You mean Tommy?  Wait, where's he go?
"
14,3,The Colonel,"Your partner is an informant for Jamie Oliver. 
"
14,3,Cartman,"Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.
"
14,3,The Colonel,"And how do I know you're not a liar too?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
"
14,3,The Colonel,"I think... you and me can work this thing out, Eric. Do business together a long time.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Good.
"
14,3,The Colonel,"Just remember, I only tell you one time. Don't fuck me, Eric. Don't you ever try to fuck me. 
"
14,3,Sharon,"Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.
"
14,3,Randy,"I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
"
14,3,Sharon,"Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? 
"
14,3,Randy,"Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?
"
14,3,Sharon,"Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-
"
14,3,Randy,"Hey. My eyes are up here.
"
14,3,Sharon,"I'm sorry, I just...
"
14,3,Randy,"It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. 
"
14,3,Randy,"Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?
"
14,3,Clerk,"I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.
"
14,3,Randy,"Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?
"
14,3,Clerk,"Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.
"
14,3,Randy,"Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
"
14,3,Billy,"What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!
"
14,3,Billy,"...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!
"
14,3,Billy,"How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric!
"
14,3,Cartman,"...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
"
14,3,Billy,"What is that supposed to mean?
"
14,3,Cartman,"I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
"
14,3,Billy,"You wouldn't do that.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
"
14,3,Billy's Mom,"Billy?! Your father and I want to talk to you!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
"
14,3,Randy,"What do we want?
"
14,3,Men,"Bigger doors!
"
14,3,Randy,"Where do we want them?
"
14,3,Men,"Weed stores!
"
14,3,Randy,"What do we want?
"
14,3,Men,"Bigger doors!
"
14,3,Randy,"Where do we want them?
"
14,3,Men,"Weed stores!
"
14,3,Clerk,"Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure.
"
14,3,Man 1,"Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.
"
14,3,Man 2,"Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others.
"
14,3,Clerk,"Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.
"
14,3,Man 3,"What's ridiculous about it?
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"Hold on, hold people people, please!  We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around! These men all have cancer! It's no coincidence that when this building changed, the rise in cancer went up. Don't you see? The KFC was keeping people healthy!
"
14,3,Tough Boy 2,"Mr. Cartman, come on. We're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
"
14,3,Tough Boy 3,"Eric, the Colonel is on the phone for you. He sounds pissed.
"
14,3,Cartman,"What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.
"
14,3,The Colonel,"Hello. Hello??
"
14,3,Cartman,"Colonel, how are you doing?
"
14,3,The Colonel,"What happened?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? 
"
14,3,The Colonel,"Eric, what happened??
"
14,3,Cartman,"We had a little problem.
"
14,3,The Colonel,"I heard.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?
"
14,3,The Colonel,"Because Jamie Oliver gave his speech at the UN today. He was not supposed to give that speech, Eric!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
"
14,3,The Colonel,"There's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Hey, take it easy Colonel.
"
14,3,The Colonel,"I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! 
"
14,3,Barbrady,"Freeze!
"
14,3,Henchman,"It's the cops! 
"
14,3,Billy's Mom,"Run Billy, run! 
"
14,3,Billy,"Mommy, no!
"
14,3,Barbrady,"Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal. 
"
14,3,Dr. Doctor,"And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us. 
"
14,3,Randy,"Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. 
"
14,3,Sharon,"Yeah. Great.
"
14,3,Randy,"Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. 
"
14,3,Sharon,"Randy, I love it! 
"
14,3,Randy,"And when it gets cold it shrinks. 
"
14,3,Woman 4,"Sharon, you got a scrotum coat?
"
14,3,Sharon,"Yyyup!
"
14,3,Woman 5,"Luckyyyyy!
"
14,4,Cartman,"I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
"
14,4,Kyle,"How the hell do you have more friends than me?
"
14,4,Cartman,"'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
"
14,4,Kyle,"How many friends do you have, Kenny?
"
14,4,Kenny,"(Sixty two)
"
14,4,Kyle,"What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
"
14,4,Stan,"Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
"
14,4,Cartman,"Stupid Facebok stuff.
"
14,4,Stan,"Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
"
14,4,Stan,"Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
"
14,4,Cartman,"Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 
"
14,4,Cartman,"Surprise! 
"
14,4,Stan,"Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
"
14,4,Kyle,"Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
"
14,4,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
14,4,Stan,"I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
"
14,4,Cartman,"Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy
"
14,4,Stan,"Who?
"
14,4,Cartman,"Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
"
14,4,Stan,"You guys are retarded I'm playing Xbox. 
"
14,4,Kyle,"There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
"
14,4,Kip,"Ahhhhh.  Haaa! Haaaaaaaaaa! Yeah! 
"
14,4,Kip,"Mom, Dad! I made a friend today!
"
14,4,Kip's Mom,"Kip, really?
"
14,4,Kip's Dad,"You did?
"
14,4,Kip,"Yeah!! 
"
14,4,Kip's Dad,"Huh son, that's wonderful.
"
14,4,Kip's Mom,"What's his name?
"
14,4,Kip,"Kyle Broflovski! He's a student, and his interests include video games and reading.
"
14,4,Kip's Mom,"Oh, is he a nice boy?
"
14,4,Kip,"Oh, he's the best, Mom! He has a green hat, and he wants the world to stop talking about ninjas. Oh! I need to tell him what I'm currently thinking about! What am I currently thinking about?! 
"
14,4,Randy,"Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?
"
14,4,Stan,"Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to.
"
14,4,Randy,"Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
"
14,4,Stan,"No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
"
14,4,Randy,"...Oh okay.  So I'm, m not your friend then?
"
14,4,Stan,"...Dad, you are my friend.
"
14,4,Randy,"...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?
"
14,4,Stan,"Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
"
14,4,Randy,"Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?
"
14,4,Stan,"I just wanna do my homework!
"
14,4,Randy,"Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?
"
14,4,Stan,"Alright, Dad, I'll add you!
"
14,4,Randy,"Oh cool! Okay. 
"
14,4,Kip,"Mom, Dad, my best friend Kyle? He went to the dentist yesterday, and got two fillings! And today he's wondering if Hurt Locker really deserved the Oscar!
"
14,4,Kip's Mom,"That's great, Kip!
"
14,4,Kip,"Yeah! 
"
14,4,Kip's Dad,"They sure are getting to know each other.
"
14,4,Kip's Mom,"I'ts amazing! You know Kip spent the morning at the boy's farm?
"
14,4,Kip's Dad,"His friend lives on a farm?
"
14,4,Kyle,"I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 
"
14,4,Wendy,"Am I a joke to you?
"
14,4,Stan,"What?
"
14,4,Wendy,"I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?
"
14,4,Stan,"...Um, no?
"
14,4,Wendy,"You DO have a Facebook page, Stan!
"
14,4,Stan,"Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
"
14,4,Wendy,"Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?
"
14,4,Stan,"Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
"
14,4,Wendy,"You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page,  we aren't friends!
"
14,4,Stan,"Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
"
14,4,Wendy,"And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to ""In a relationship""!
"
14,4,Stan,"How?
"
14,4,Wendy,"By editing your profile under ""basic information""!
"
14,4,Stan,"Okay, I'm sorry!
"
14,4,Stan,"""Edit profile. Basic... settings"" Jesus Christ!
"
14,4,Randy,"Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
"
14,4,Stan,"...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
"
14,4,Randy,"Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
"
14,4,Stan,"Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
"
14,4,Randy,"That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. 
"
14,4,Stan,"Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?
"
14,4,Cartman,"Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Can I come in?
"
14,4,Stan,"Sure dude.  Dude, what's the matter?
"
14,4,Kyle,"I... don't... have... any... friends...
"
14,4,Stan,"What?
"
14,4,Kyle,"I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
"
14,4,Stan,"Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.
"
14,4,Kyle,"'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?
"
14,4,Stan,"NO.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
"
14,4,Stan,"Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
"
14,4,Kyle,"You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!
"
14,4,Stan,"Ah fuck.
"
14,4,Stan,"Okay it says I'm at your farm.
"
14,4,Kyle,"'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...
"
14,4,Stan,"'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
"
14,4,Kip's Dad,"So Kip, you spend more time with your buddy Kyle today?
"
14,4,Kip,"Oh yeah Dad, we've been havin' the best time! I showed him all the pictures of me and that silly Halloween costume last year.
"
14,4,Kip's Mom,"Oh, what'd he say about those?
"
14,4,Kip,"He laughed out loud. And then he was rollin' on the floor laughin'!
"
14,4,Kip's Dad,"Sounds like you boys had a ball!
"
14,4,Kip,"Mom, Dad, I'm all done. Can I go hang out with Kyle and tell him all about what I had for dinner?
"
14,4,Kip's Dad,"Well it's a little late, but it is Friday.
"
14,4,Kip's Mom,"I thnk the more time you spend with your little friend, the better.
"
14,4,Kip,"Wow, thanks! 
"
14,4,Kip's Mom,"Have fun and be safe! 
"
14,4,Kip,"Ate a pork chop for dinner. Had nice apple sauce too.  Hahaa haha! Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
"
14,4,Wendy,"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume.""
"
14,4,Stan,"What?
"
14,4,Wendy,"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume."" What is that supposed to mean?!
"
14,4,Stan,"...I have no idea.
"
14,4,Wendy,"That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! 
"
14,4,Stan,"Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! 
"
14,4,Man 1,"Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?
"
14,4,Stan,"Fine! 
"
14,4,Man 2,"Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request?
"
14,4,Stan,"I don't know you!
"
14,4,Man 2,"Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess! 
"
14,4,Randy,"Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
"
14,4,Stan,"...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-
"
14,4,Randy,"Stan, poke your grandma!
"
14,4,Stan,"No. NO! Screw this! You know what? ""Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile."" There! ""Delete Profile""!  ""You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel"" Proceed!  ""Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No."" Yes! ""Are you totally sure?"" Yes! 
"
14,4,Computer Voice,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Stan Marsh.
"
14,4,Stan,"You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? 
"
14,4,Computer Voice,"I'm gonna have to put you on the game grid.
"
14,4,Stan,"Delete Profile! ""Are you totally sure? Yes or-"" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck? 
"
14,4,Guard 1,"Alright get moving, Profile.
"
14,4,Stan,"Profile? I'm not a profile.
"
14,4,Guard 1,"Ignore. 
"
14,4,Stan,"AAH. 
"
14,4,Profile 1,"Tom Davis says hello to Linda Green's profile.
"
14,4,Profile 2,"Linda Davis likes how Tom Davis has changed his status.
"
14,4,Stan,"'Scuse me, my name is-
"
14,4,Profile 3,"Ignore.
"
14,4,Stan,"Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
"
14,4,Profile 4,"Ignore.
"
14,4,Stan,"Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!
"
14,4,Kyle,"I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
"
14,4,Cartman,"You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
"
14,4,Kyle,"I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
"
14,4,Cartman,"Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
"
14,4,Kyle,"I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
"
14,4,Cartman,"It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
"
14,4,Kyle,"No. What's chatroulette?
"
14,4,Cartman,"Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.
"
14,4,Cartman,"Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Aww, that's some dude jacking off! 
"
14,4,Cartman,"Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
"
14,4,Kyle,"That's just a guy's penis too!
"
14,4,Cartman,"Okay let's, let's try this one.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
"
14,4,Cartman,"Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
"
14,4,Dude,"Hey.
"
14,4,Cartman,"This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
"
14,4,Dude,"Oh yeah? 
"
14,4,Cartman,"Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
"
14,4,Kyle,"Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
"
14,4,Cartman,"Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
"
14,4,Stan,"Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
"
14,4,Tom Davis,"No, you aren't my friend. Would you like to be my friend?
"
14,4,Stan,"No, I seriously don't want any more friends.
"
14,4,Tom Davis,"Ignore.  So anyway, I really like taking long walks in the summer, you know, because there's like
"
14,4,Stan,"Okay I'll be your friend.
"
14,4,Tom Davis,"Confirm.  Oooo, Tom Davis is thrilled to have become powerful by adding a new friend. Here are some pictures of my dog. And here he is in some silly outfits. Can you comment on these?
"
14,4,Stan,"Awww!
"
14,4,Guard,"Move it, profile!
"
14,4,Tom Davis,"Oh oh.
"
14,4,Stan,"Why oh oh?
"
14,4,Profile 5,"They're taking him to the gaming arena.
"
14,4,Tom Davis,"Looks like I'm gonna be down a friend. 
"
14,4,Referee,"You are about to face each other in combat! You will play the game for the amusement of the users!  Let the game commence! 
"
14,4,Stan,"Yahtzee?
"
14,4,Referee,"One round only! Begin! 
"
14,4,Profile 6,"Uhhh, I'm gonna count five in my five box.
"
14,4,Stan,"Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
"
14,4,Guard,"Play, profile!
"
14,4,Stan,"Yahtzee. 
"
14,4,Cartman,"Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...
"
14,4,Kyle,"That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 
"
14,4,Cartman,"Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.
"
14,4,Boy,"Hello.
"
14,4,Cartman,"Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
"
14,4,Boy,"Oh that's cool. I was startin' to think this was nothin' but dudes jackin' off.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
"
14,4,Boy,"Uhh, sure. If you'll come and visit my farm.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
"
14,4,Kip's Dad,"Honey, where's Kip? I haven't seen him all day.
"
14,4,Kip's Mom,"No, he's been out spending the whole day with his best friend Kyle. I think they're at the movies now.
"
14,4,Referee,"Troublemaker! You were not supposed to survive the game of Yahtzee! You have made things complicated!
"
14,4,Stan,"I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
"
14,4,Referee,"That's not what your profile said.
"
14,4,Stan,"My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
"
14,4,Referee,"Your profile is one of the most powerful in all of Facebook. You cannot stop it now.
"
14,4,Stan,"Oh yeah? I can try! 
"
14,4,Referee,"After him!
"
14,4,Kyle,"Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. ""Hey Kyle, really like your farm."" Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 
"
14,4,Stan,"You're an asshole, Kyle!
"
14,4,Kyle,"...What?
"
14,4,Stan,"What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
"
14,4,Kyle,"Dude, w-what are you doing?
"
14,4,Stan,"What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
"
14,4,Kyle,"Profile status?
"
14,4,Stan,"Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
"
14,4,Kyle,"Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
"
14,4,Stan,"Dude! Fuck your crops! 
"
14,4,Kyle,"Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
"
14,4,Stan,"Where?
"
14,4,Kyle,"Café World.
"
14,4,Stan,"Son of a bitch! 
"
14,4,Kyle,"An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!

14,4,Stan,"Jesus Christ.

"
14,4,Kyle,"Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
"
14,4,Isiah,"Isiah's order is on leaving Kyle Broflovski as a friend.
"
14,4,Kyle,"What? Why?
"
14,4,Isiah,"User saw you were friends with Kip Drordy, who only has one friend. Kyle Broflovski is bad friend stock.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
"
14,4,Isiah,"Ignore.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Unh, that does it!
"
14,4,Stan,"Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh! 
"
14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"Right here.
"
14,4,Stan,"Oh...
"
14,4,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 
"
14,4,Stan,"What do you want from me, dude?!
"
14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"I'm your profile, and as you can see, I am much more powerful than you.
"
14,4,Stan,"Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
"
14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"Why do you think I brought you in here? The fact of the matter is I'm up and running now with almost a million friends. I don't need you anymore. I have more friends than you'll ever have in the real world.
"
14,4,Stan,"Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
"
14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"Who is more powerful? The user or the profile? Let's end this once and for all. 
"
14,4,Referee,"Let the final battle begin! 
"
14,4,Stan,"Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously? 
"
14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"What did I tell you?! That's a large flush already! You don't have a chance in here, user! You pathetic little-
"
14,4,Stan,"Yahtzee.
"
14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"What?!
"
14,4,Stan,"Yahtzee. Sixes.
"
14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"No. Can't be.
"
14,4,Randy,"Yahtzee!
"
14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"No! Ahhhhh. 
"
14,4,Stan,"Awgh!  Oh thank God.
"
14,4,Randy,"Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?
"
14,4,Stan,"My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
"
14,4,Randy,"Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?
"
14,4,Stan,"Fuck off, Dad. 
"
14,5,Tour Guide,"Our factory works 24/7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. Here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk.
"
14,5,Cartman,"Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!
"
14,5,Kyle,"You should know, fatass.
"
14,5,Cartman,"AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
"
14,5,Stan,"Oh God, you guys, really? This again? 
"
14,5,Tour Guide,"And here is where all the fudge is put into boxes to be shipped all over the world.
"
14,5,Kyle,"Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
"
14,5,Cartman,"I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
"
14,5,Stan,"You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 
"
14,5,Butters,"Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?
"
14,5,Stan,"Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"What did you call me?
"
14,5,Cartman,"Hey, that is Tom Cruise! 
"
14,5,Butters,"How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"I'm not a fudge packer!
"
14,5,Kyle,"Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"But I'm not a fudge packer! 
"
14,5,Stan,"Then why are you packing fudge?
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"I'm not. I am a very busy actor who is trying to get away for a week and do some fly fishing! 
"
14,5,Stan,"Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Oh, that does it. I will SUE you!
"
14,5,Stan,"For what?
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"You can't just call somebody a fudge packer and get away with it! 
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, is that fudge-packer Tom Cruise?
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"That's it!  I'm suing this entire intolerant town!
"
14,5,Stan,"But dude-
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"No buts! If you want to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker, you're gonna pay the consequences!
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Guys, I want to really thank you all for coming. Shockingly, I've just been slandered once again in the town of South Park, something I know you can all relate to. 
"
14,5,Tiger Woods,"That town just seems to be a hotbed of hatred and lies!
"
14,5,Bono,"I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit!
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Yeah, well I was just over there doing a little fly fishing and this little boy walks up and calls me a fudge packer!  I know, right? And then other kids in the town and their teacher start joining in. 
"
14,5,Sally Struthers,"South Park, Colorado, is the most racist, insensitive, and bigoted place in this country! 
"
14,5,George Lucas,"That place thinks they can say whatever they want about us and get away with it!
"
14,5,Paris Hilton,"If anyone has a gripe against that shithole, it's me! 
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Yeah, well I say enough. All of us together can put a stop to that slander coming from that town once and for all! No longer will they make snide remarks about whoever they want.
"
14,5,All Celebrities,"YEAH!
"
14,5,Jared Fogle,"Hey, Tom. I ate too much Subway. Where's your bathroom?
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Oh, just the door down the hall there, Jared.  No, no, no, that's a closet. Go down more.  No that's a closet too.  Nope, Jared. That's a closet too.  No.  That's a closet... No that- that's a closet too.
"
14,5,Principal Victoria,"Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!
"
14,5,Kyle,"Dude, what did you do?
"
14,5,Stan,"I have no idea...
"
14,5,Randy,"You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!
"
14,5,Principal Victoria,"Did you call him a fudge packer?
"
14,5,Stan,"Aww... he was packing fudge!
"
14,5,Mayor,"Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!
"
14,5,Mr. Mackey,"They are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town, m'kay!
"
14,5,Stan,"It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
"
14,5,Principal Victoria,"But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.
"
14,5,Gerald,"Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!
"
14,5,Sgt. Yates,"Dammit Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly son in line!
"
14,5,Randy,"Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!
"
14,5,Randy,"Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"That's nice!  I'm still suing you all! Nobody calls me a fudge packer! 
"
14,5,Randy,"Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... 
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"WHAT?
"
14,5,Randy,"We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"I am an actor. I do not pack fudge! 
"
14,5,Randy,"Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says ""Fred's Fudge and Candies""... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. 
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Well, there is... one thing that your town could do to... maybe make me forget about this lawsuit.
"
14,5,Randy,"ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"It's just that there's somebody that I have always wanted to meet... face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town-
"
14,5,Randy,"Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Muhammad. The prophet of the Muslim faith.
"
14,5,Stan,"Ooooooo...
"
14,5,Randy,"That's... tricky...
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Well then you can just get sued! 
"
14,5,Randy,"Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"No! Just him. You get Muhammad to appear or your little town is DONE!
"
14,5,Randy,"Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed! 
"
14,5,Stephen,"Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.
"
14,5,Kyle,"Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.
"
14,5,Mr. Mackey,"But even if it were safe for Muhammad to be shown, how would we ever find him?
"
14,5,Sgt. Yates,"Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like. 
"
14,5,Stan,"I saw him once. 
"
14,5,McDaniels,"You did?
"
14,5,Stan,"Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?
"
14,5,Stan,"No, dude, it was totally fine.
"
14,5,Sgt. Yates,"Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?
"
14,5,Stan,"Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
"
14,5,Randy,"Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. 
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"No, don't!  Is that okay to show?
"
14,5,Jimbo,"I don't know. I guess we'll see.
"
14,5,Hillary Clinton,"Tom, what is up with this Muhammad thing? It doesn't make sense!
"
14,5,Jesse Jackson,"Yeah, you said we were just suing South Park.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"No, I said we were going to use South Park to make sure we never got ripped on again. Look people, all of us get ridiculed, but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander?
"
14,5,Oprah Winfrey,"You want Muhammad because he can't be ridiculed?
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Muhammad has a power that makes him impervious to being made fun of. What if we could harness that power?  Jimmy Buffet, how would you like it if no-one could ever call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage?
"
14,5,Jimmy Buffet,"I... I'd love it!
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"By taking what Muhammad has, we could all be safe from ridicule.  Like Tim Burton here. Imagine it Tim; nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies you've made lately. There'd never be a TV show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since Beetlejuice. And, you put Johnny Depp and all the same crappy music in every film. And if you're that in love with Johnny Depp, then you should just have sex with him already. A TV show could never say that!
"
14,5,Tim Burton,"Gee, that'd be swell.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Well it can be a reality. Once we have Muhammad, we can take that power from him. 
"
14,5,Cartman,"Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Hey! It's one of the boys from South Park who slandered me!
"
14,5,Cartman,"I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
"
14,5,Michael Richards,"Who? 
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Alllloooo... 
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Jennifer Lopez! 
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Yes, I am Hennifer Lopez, and I like tacos and burritos.
"
14,5,Narrator,"In the great hall of the Super Best Friends, there are assembled the leaders of the world's greatest religions; Jesus!  Buddha!  Krishna!  Muhammad!  Lao Tzu and Joseph Smith  and... the mighty Semen! 
"
14,5,Seaman,"It's not semen, it's Seaman!
"
14,5,Narrator,"Their mission; right that which is wrong, and to serve all mankind.
"
14,5,Stan,"Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.
"
14,5,Jesus,"My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances.
"
14,5,Buddha,"We simply cannot risk any violence from the Muslim people
"
14,5,Stan,"Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
"
14,5,Narrator,"Back in the hall of the Super Best Friends...
"
14,5,Kyle,"Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
"
14,5,Joseph Smith,"No, Muslims would still be angry if you showed his face.
"
14,5,Kyle,"K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
"
14,5,Lao Tzu,"No, cause you would still be showing him walking around, that could be a-trouble.
"
14,5,Stan,"Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
"
14,5,Jesus,"But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.
"
14,5,Kyle,"Aww come on! This is ridiculous! 
"
14,5,Joseph Smith,"Boys, you need to understand that people get very offended when Muhammad is mocked because he is a religious figure. 
"
14,5,Jesus,"Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids! 
"
14,5,Kyle,"A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
"
14,5,Joseph Smith,"But he's talking from the U-Haul?
"
14,5,Stan,"Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
"
14,5,Jesus,"Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses? 
"
14,5,Moses,"Um... would there be windows on the U-Haul?
"
14,5,Kyle,"There doesn't have to be...
"
14,5,Moses,"Um... I guess... I guess that would be okay.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Here it is friends. Once we have Muhammad, this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of.
"
14,5,Russel Crowe,"Tom, Tom, you're talkin' crazy mate. Only Muhammad has that ability, how could we ever get it from him? 
"
14,5,Rob Reiner,"We take his goo! It's as simple as that friends. 
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Rob Reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth.
"
14,5,Rob Reiner,"Any goo can be harvested from a person's body, and easily placed into another. 
"
14,5,Cartman,"Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"No Jen, we all have got enough money.
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Yes, who needs more money, we need to get Muhammad's goo! Yes, yes, ariva ariva!
"
14,5,Cartman,"Uh, excuse us for a second... 
"
14,5,Cartman,"Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"What am I doing? Just having some fun, cholo!
"
14,5,Cartman,"Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Just keep your mouth shut, and do what I tell you!
"
14,5,Cartman,"If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut, kid.
"
14,5,Cartman,"You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo.
"
14,5,Cartman,"Yeah, so what?
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo.
"
14,5,Cartman,"So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"You catch on quick kid... 
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Mrs. Lopez...
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"Hurry, get my wig back on! 
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Hey, I was just seeing if you needed some- Oh, god  you found my fudge packing uniform...
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, your secret is safe with me, Tommy!
"
14,5,Randy,"Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.
"
14,5,Mayor,"Thank you so much for coming, Muhammad. 
"
14,5,Muhammad,"You're welcome.
"
14,5,Mr Garrison,"Oh, is that okay?
"
14,5,Jimbo,"I don't know.
"
14,5,Randy,"Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.
"
14,5,Stan,"What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
"
14,5,Gerald,"Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
"
14,5,Kyle,"But Muhammad can't be seen dad.
"
14,5,Sgt. Yates,"Alright, we'll put a sheet over him.
"
14,5,Stan,"No, you can't even show his feet.
"
14,5,Sheila,"How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"No, you could still see his eyes...
"
14,5,Randy,"Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? 
"
14,5,Mayor,"Muhammad, would that be OK?
"
14,5,Muhammad,"OK.
"
14,5,Hillary Clinton,"Tom, Rob, we've just received word from the lawyers. South Park is saying they have Muhammad for us! 
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Rob, will the machine be ready?
"
14,5,Rob Reiner,"Oh, it'll be ready! 
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"More tacos!
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"More tacos!
"
14,5,Cartman,"No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"More tacos.
"
14,5,Cartman,"You just had seven tacos.
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"I want more tacos! 
"
14,5,Cartman,"I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"I am Jennifer Lopez, I need tacos to live!
"
14,5,Cartman,"You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! 
"
14,5,Charlie Sheen,"Mrs. Lopez, I can go. What do you want, like three tacos?
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, thank you 'harlie Sheeeeen. And maybe an enchirito too?
"
14,5,Cartman,"Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Yes they do!
"
14,5,Cartman,"I tried getting one last week!
"
14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Not all Taco Bells have enchiritos, but some still carry them.
"
14,5,Cartman,"God, will somebody shut her up?
"
14,5,Randy,"Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. 
"
14,5,Mayor,"You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad. 
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Hold on a second! 
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Stop! There are some extremists! They are threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they are going to bomb us!
"
14,5,Mayor,"What?!
"
14,5,Randy,"Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again. 
"
14,5,Jared Fogle,"Alright, we got him Tom. 
"
14,5,Stan,"Muhammad, are you okay? 
"
14,5,Randy,"What the hell was that?!
"
14,5,Sgt. Yates,"Obviously the terrorists are for real!  What does that paper say?  We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah.
"
14,5,Stan,"They want his power?
"
14,5,Kyle,"What kind of extremists are these? 
"
14,5,Sgt. Yates,"You won't believe it...
"
14,5,Lead Ginger,"Our time is near! Soon, gingers will never be made fun of again!
"
14,5,All Gingers,"Huzzah!
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"Where the hell do you think you're going?
"
14,5,Cartman,"I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"You gonna walk away from 50 mil? 
"
14,5,Cartman,"Let me by...
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life.
"
14,5,Cartman,"Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner.
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"Then I guess I won't tell you about your father. 
"
14,5,Cartman,"My father...
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right?
"
14,5,Cartman,"I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"You really still believe that garbage? The people in your town sold you that line. Come on, you've had to have doubted it all along. 
"
14,5,Cartman,"How could you know anything about who my family is?
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return.
"
14,5,Cartman,"If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
"
14,5,Mitch,"You just take me where I tell you, and when you learn the truth, you will learn to trust me. And nobody else...
"
14,5,Barbrady,"Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.
"
14,5,Sgt. Yates,"Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible!
"
14,5,Mayor,"Jesus, what are we supposed to do?!
"
14,5,Jimbo,"We have to give in to their demands.
"
14,5,McDaniels,"I'm sorry Muhammad, but we are going to have to give you over the gingers.
"
14,5,Kyle,"We can't give him over to the gingers!
"
14,5,Stan,"Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.
"
14,5,Gerald,"But our homes and our lives are at stake.
"
14,5,Stan,"We made a promise... to Jesus! 
"
14,5,Randy,"Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. 
"
14,5,Jimbo,"That'll be Tom Cruise... 
"
14,5,Randy,"Helllo?
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Yeah, so whats going on?
"
14,5,Randy,"Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"What do you mean, you're not givin' him to us?!
"
14,5,Randy,"There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Gingers?
"
14,5,Kanye West,"Gingers? Aww, hell no.
"
14,5,Randy,"Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"You're going to give Muhammad to gingers instead of us, just because they are threatening you with violence?
"
14,5,Randy,"Well, yeah.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Oh, we can play that game too! You want to see violence, well you got it! 
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Goddamn stupid assholes! You want to play rough?! OK! Spielburg, go and get some automatic rifles! We'll go in there, and we're going to take  Muhammad by force! And then we are going to show them th- 
"
14,5,Rob Reiner,"Tom, Tom. We can't be seen getting violent.
"
14,5,Hillary Clinton,"Yeah, that would kill all our careers!
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"But the only way we are going to get Muhammad from South Park now is by getting just as violent as the gingers!
"
14,5,Rob Reiner,"Fine, then let's have Her do it.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Her who?
"
14,5,Rob Reiner,"You know... Her.
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Oh right...  Her.
"
14,5,Rob Reiner,"There she is Tom... Barbra Streisand.
"
14,5,Robert Redford,"My God, she's even more terrifying than I remember.
"
14,5,Steven Spielberg,"Tom, Barbra Streisand hasn't been active for a long time. Are we sure we want to do this?
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Mrs. Streisand got torn apart in the town of South Park. She's probably more angry at that town than any of us.
"
14,5,Rob Reiner,"Power her up! Release the Kraken! 
"
14,5,Rob Reiner,"Hey Barbra. It's me, Rob Reiner. 
"
14,5,Rob Reiner,"Listen, Babs, we are taking on the town of South Park and we really need your help
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"We figured you're pissed at South Park too, right Mrs. Streisand? 
"
14,5,Tom Cruise,"Oh, she's pissed all right.
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, what are you doing here?
"
14,5,Cartman,"Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-
"
14,5,Cartman,"I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-
"
14,5,Cartman,"I said GET. Mr. Hat!
"
14,5,Cartman,"Put it on!  Do the voice.
"
14,5,Mr. Hat,"Hello kids, it's me, Mr. Hat. 
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"Good to see you Hat. Helluva night, isn't it?
"
14,5,Mr. Hat,"I... I don't believe I know you.
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"The name's Mitch Conner, I flew the same division as you back in Saigon. 
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-
"
14,5,Cartman,"Keep... your hand... UP!
"
14,5,Randy,"Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. 
"
14,5,Lead Ginger,"Nuh uh, first you gotta prove that that is still Muhammad in there! Have him step out of the bear costume...
"
14,5,Townspeople,"Ohhhhhhh...
"
14,5,Stan,"Dude, we can't do that
"
14,5,Lead Ginger,"Show us it's Muhammad or South Park is finished!
"
14,5,Mr. Hat,"Dammit Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered!
"
14,5,Mitch Conner,"So you admit it. There was a cover up. 
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"No Mr. Hat, don't say any more!
"
14,5,Mitch,"Yeah, tell 'im whatcha know!
"
14,5,Garrison,"Alright Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with.
"
14,5,Cartman,"By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death.  A lot of suffering. Darkness that most people couldn't stand to see.  I tried to sit it out as much as I could. 
"
14,6,Soldier 1,"What's the matter, Conner? You don't like a little blood?
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner.
"
14,6,Soldier 2,"Incoming! 
"
14,6,Army Doctor,"Conner, Mitchell. You're discharged, son.
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"And that's that. ""Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam.""  So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher.
"
14,6,Mr. Garrison,"Eric I,  I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"Sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.
"
14,6,Cartman,"That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
"
14,6,Mr. Garrison,"All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.
"
14,6,Randy,"Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.
"
14,6,Ginger 1,"We have no way of knowing if Muhammad is really in there. It could be a trick.
"
14,6,Stan,"It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
"
14,6,Ginger 1,"Then have him step out of the bear costume! You have until the count of ten! One!
"
14,6,Jimbo,"Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.
"
14,6,Ginger 1,"Two!
"
14,6,Sgt. Yates,"Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to definitely get bombed.
"
14,6,Ginger 1,"Three!
"
14,6,Randy,"Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? 
"
14,6,Stan,"Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.
"
14,6,Ginger 2,"That isn't Muhammad, that's Santy Claus.
"
14,6,Santa,"Sorry, boys. I tried.
"
14,6,Kyle,"Aw crap.
"
14,6,Randy,"Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?
"
14,6,Stan,"When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
"
14,6,Mr. Hankey,"I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you.
"
14,6,Stan,"If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
"
14,6,Ginger 1,"So where is he?! 
"
14,6,Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the Hall of the Super Best Friends...
"
14,6,Jesus,"Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem.
"
14,6,Buddha,"Ohhh, and you're one to talk! With all your Internet porn!
"
14,6,Jesus,"Watching porn isn't like doing coke, fag!
"
14,6,Joseph Smith,"Jesus Christ!
"
14,6,Jesus,"What?
"
14,6,Joseph Smith,"We've got a distress signal coming in. 
"
14,6,Jesus,"On the Super Best Screen!
"
14,6,Police Officer,"Super Best Friends! You've got to help us! The Casa Bonita is under attack! 
"
14,6,Jesus,"Great Scott! It's Barbra Streisand! 
"
14,6,Lao Tse,"I thought Barbra Streisand had been destroyed by Robert Smith.
"
14,6,Seaman,"Yeah. Who would have activated her again?
"
14,6,Jesus,"I don't know, Seaman. 
"
14,6,Seaman,"It's Sea-Man! 
"
14,6,Police Officer,"The Casa Bonita is gone! Jesus help us!
"
14,6,Jesus,"Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her!  On the Super Best Friends power cycles! 
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"There there, my little mouse friend. Soon you will have more asses than you ever dreamed of.  Ah, Kevin. You brought me my Fonseca. That's a good boy.  What's this? Someone is at the door, Kevin.  We tried to be left alone, Kevin. Who would disturb us at this hour? We must be careful.  Why, it's an African-American man, Kevin.  Yes? What do you want?
"
14,6,Person,"Yo man, sorry to bother you, but there's been an accident down the street, man. Can I use your telephone?
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in.
"
14,6,Person,"Yo, I understand, man, but this accident is real bad, dawg. My lady's leg is all busted up and shit; she all crawlin' around on the road lookin' like a crippled crab, man. I just need an ambulance, dog!
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there.
"
14,6,Person,"Okay, I see. I guess I understand. You just don't wanna let a black man in yo' house.
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"No, please, it isn't that at all.
"
14,6,Person,"No, I gets it man. Thought things had changed, dog. Thought when we got a black president, things would be different. We gots our black president, but Whitey still don't trust me to use his motherfuckin' phone.
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in. 
"
14,6,Cartman,"Ahaaa!
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"WAAH!
"
14,6,Kevin,"AAAH!
"
14,6,Cartman,"Nice work, Conner.
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"Yeah, the old ""Hasn't anything changed?"" speech. Works on white people all the time.
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Eric Cartman?
"
14,6,Cartman,"Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
"
14,6,Santa,"Holy crap! 
"
14,6,Pip,"Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits.  Haaah! 
"
14,6,Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom, which is Tom Cruise's house.
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"How do you like that?! Celebrities can get violent too!
"
14,6,Randy,"Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"We will call her off when you give us Muhammad!
"
14,6,Randy,"We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"That's your problem! Get him back or Babs will kill you all!
"
14,6,Mickey Mouse,"Oh boy!
"
14,6,Stan,"Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!
"
14,6,Kenny,"(I am. He's right here.) 
"
14,6,Stan,"Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.
"
14,6,Kyle,"Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
"
14,6,Stan,"The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
"
14,6,Kyle,"Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
"
14,6,Kenny,"(What?)
"
14,6,Kyle,"Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
"
14,6,Stan,"...Yeah.
"
14,6,Kyle,"I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 
"
14,6,Richard Tweek,"She's going to get our coffee store next.
"
14,6,Mr. Slave,"Ooooo, Jesus Christ. 
"
14,6,Jesus,"That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa!  Smith! Try your ice breath! 
"
14,6,Joseph Smith,"No good!
"
14,6,Seaman,"Look out! Barbra Streisand is using her toxic stink ray! 
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Them who?!
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Then start explaining it to me!
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Very well.
"
14,6,Kyle,"Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.
"
14,6,Stan,"Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in! 
"
14,6,Kyle,"Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Oh, all right.
"
14,6,Cartman,"No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
"
14,6,Stan,"Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
"
14,6,Cartman,"It's all that matters!
"
14,6,Kyle,"Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
"
14,6,Cartman,"I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
"
14,6,Announcer,"In the small mountain town of South Park, the holy prophet of the Mormon religion is trying to fly up the nose of a deadly female singer. 
"
14,6,Seaman,"Our powers aren't working, Swallow. 
"
14,6,Joseph Smith,"We can't attack Streisand's nose! It's just too big!
"
14,6,Jesus,"We have to find another weak spot!  Moses!
"
14,6,Moses,"What?
"
14,6,Jesus,"We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!
"
14,6,Moses,"Um... Let me think... Um... Oh I know... Barbra Streisand can't resist singing duets with Neil Diamond.
"
14,6,Jesus,"All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner. 
"
14,6,Seaman,"It's Sea-Man and Swallow.
"
14,6,Jesus,"Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!
"
14,6,Seaman,"Fine! Swallow, come. 
"
14,6,Moses,"Heh heh heheheh. No way he just said that.
"
14,6,Stan,"Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.
"
14,6,Kyle,"Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart?
"
14,6,Kyle,"Oh, you are not doing that again!
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!
"
14,6,Kyle,"Stop talking with your stupid hand!
"
14,6,Cartman,"Who you calling stupid, Jew?
"
14,6,Stan,"Come on, guys, we're running out of time! 
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Yes?
"
14,6,Man,"Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone.
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American.
"
14,6,Man,"...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Beat it I'm not helpin' you!
"
14,6,Kyle,"Dude!
"
14,6,Stan,"That's not cool!
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"No no, you don't understand.
"
14,6,Kyle,"We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
"
14,6,Stan,"We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Alright, alright, jeez. 
"
14,6,Ginger 1,"Hahaaa!
"
14,6,Stan,"Oh crap, the gingers!
"
14,6,Cartman,"Gingers? No!
"
14,6,Announcer,"L-later, at the Legion of Doom.
"
14,6,Benedict XVI,"Tom, Tom! The gingers are claiming they have Muhammad!
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"What?! Impossible!
"
14,6,Benedict XVI,"They are sending a message now!
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"On screen! 
"
14,6,Ginger 1,"We got Muhammad! We got Muhammad!
"
14,6,Rob Reiner,"He's useless to you! You can't get Muhammad's power to not be made fun of without the Rob Reiner Goo Transfer Machine!
"
14,6,Ginger 1,"Why do you think we're calling?!
"
14,6,Ginger 3,"Our boss is willing to share Muhammad with you if you're willing to share the goo machine with us!
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"...Your ...boss?
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go.
"
14,6,Ginger 1,"Oh no no! The head ginger has plans for you!
"
14,6,Stan,"What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!
"
14,6,Ginger 2,"Heheh, the head ginger has somethin' reeeally special planned for him.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"You might wanna 
"
14,6,Cartman,"Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. 
"
14,6,A Voice,"Eric Cartman. I've waited a long time for this.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Daddy?
"
14,6,A Voice,"Guess again.  Welcome, to my Chili Con Carnival.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
"
14,6,A Voice,"Oh, but it can.  Revenge is a dish best served...  chili.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
"
14,6,Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the concert stage Jesus built with his power of super-carpentry...
"
14,6,Joseph Smith,"That's it, Jesus. The band has been paid and the PA system is working.
"
14,6,Jesus,"Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you.
"
14,6,Krishna,"Form of... Neil Diamond.  If you all wouldn't mind, I'd like to invite a special friend to join me on stage. Miss Barbra Streisand! 
"
14,6,Jesus,"Let's hope to Christ this works. 
"
14,6,Krishna,"Hello gorgeous. What do you say? Shall we sing together again like the old times? 
Well that's because I love the girl. 
And I still love you now. What have you got to say? 
That might be true, but I still miss ya at night. 
When you roll over, by my side, and you kiss me goodnight. 
"
14,6,Joseph Smith,"It worked, Jesus!
"
14,6,Jesus,"Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"Do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? I spent quite a while in a mental institution, Eric.  A lot of time for me to learn everything about you, so that one day I could take you down. I even learned the name of your father.  Oh, I know you're confused. Who wouldn't be?  You've been lied to by everyone!  Even by your own mother!  Hahahahahahahaha. 
"
14,6,Cartman,"What do you know?!
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"I wanted to torment you with your father's identity. But what I found was more shocking than I could have possibly guessed!
"
14,6,Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the gingers' lair...
"
14,6,Russell Crowe,"Alright, Muhammad is secure. 
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"Let's do this. Throw the switch, Rob.  Ohhh. Uhhh. Yes! I can feel it! I can feel the power to not be ridiculed flowing through my veins!  Ha. Hahahaha! 
"
14,6,Paris Hilton,"O M G it worked!
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"I've done it! I've done it! Look at me! I'm not okay to make fun of anymore!
"
14,6,Benedict XVI,"Ooo you lucky fucker.
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"Welcome, everyone, to the final act of my fabulous Chili Carnival!
"
14,6,Liane,"Please, leave my boy alone!
"
14,6,Cartman,"Mom?
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"I got them all here for you, Eric! So listen while you got told the truth!
"
14,6,Mr. Garrison,"Please don't. We have to protect 'em.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Protect who??
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"Yes, protect... who? Tell him! Mr...  Jimbo! 
"
14,6,Jimbo,"Protect... the Denver Broncos.
"
14,6,Announcer,"Meanwhile...
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"This is incredible. Who wants to go next?
"
14,6,Benedict XVI,"I want to be next.
"
14,6,Ginger 4,"No, gingers go next.
"
14,6,Mickey Mouse,"Gingers can suck it! I'm next, ha!
"
14,6,Rob Reiner,"It's my goo machine! I'm next!
"
14,6,Jesus,"Nobody is going next!  Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!
"
14,6,Ginger 4,"They can't stop all of us! Get 'em!
"
14,6,Jesus,"Kyaaaaa!
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"The Denver Broncos.  There was a right tackle, see? Who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom, and everyone here covered it up! To protect the Bronco name!
"
14,6,Mr. Garrison,"They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!
"
14,6,Cartman,"My dad was a Denver Bronco?
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos?
"
14,6,Cartman,"No- nooo.
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"The only Bronco who lived in South Park. He got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named Liane Cartman!
"
14,6,Liane,"No please!
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"Tell him! You almost did before but you got shot by your brother who was a Bronco fan! Tell him!
"
14,6,Dr. Mephesto,"It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!
"
14,6,Cartman,"No! Noooo!
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Now eat your chili!  The Super Best Friends? Oh no! 
"
14,6,Seaman,"I'll get you, Tom Cruise! 
"
14,6,Stan,"Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"What did you say?!
"
14,6,Kyle,"Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
"
14,6,Jesus,"I guess maybe Tom Cruise likes Seaman. 
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"Whoawhoa whoa whoa!  You're not supposed to be able to make fun of me anymore! What the hell's going on?!
"
14,6,Scott Tenorman,"I'll be back, Super Best Friends! 
"
14,6,Jesus,"Who's the creepy ginger kid?
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"Reiner, you said the goo machine would work! But I got made fun of!
"
14,6,Kyle,"That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
"
14,6,Jesus,"That's right. Don't you see, gingers?  If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.
"
14,6,Santa,"That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.
"
14,6,Stan,"Yeah.
"
14,6,Mayor McDaniels,"Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.
"
14,6,Stan,"Oh dude, look.  Hey, Cartman...
"
14,6,Kyle,"Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
"
14,6,Stan,"Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
"
14,6,Cartman,"My dad was a ginger!
"
14,6,Kyle,"Wwait, what?
"
14,6,Cartman,"I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
"
14,6,Kyle,"Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"Hey Eric, Eric!
"
14,6,Cartman,"What?
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"Come on, cheer up.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
"
14,6,Kyle,"You gotta be kidding me!
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"Shut up Kyle, you dumb Jew.  You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
"
14,6,Mitch Conner,"There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Take it easy, Conner. 
"
14,6,Stan,"Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"I... I just can't do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there's nowhere on earth that people aren't around to rip on me.
"
14,6,Kyle,"Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
"
14,6,Stan,"We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!
"
14,6,Tom Cruise,"You... really? Somewhere where I can just ...live out my days in peace and quiet and- Oh.  Oh please, can you show me where?
"
14,6,Stan,"We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.

"
14,7,Towelie,"Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. 
"
14,7,Towelie,"Get out of my face! Get out of here! 
"
14,7,Towelie,"My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills.  And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways.  Except for one.  I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. 
"
14,7,Towelie,"Hey buddy, want your dick sucked?  Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?
"
14,7,Stan,"Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
"
14,7,Kyle,"If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
"
14,7,Butters,"Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!
"
14,7,Stan,"There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! 
"
14,7,Singers,"Are you ready for the summer?
Are you ready for the good times?
Are you ready for the birds and bees?
The apple trees?
And a whole lot of fooling around?

"
14,7,Jimmy,"Oh boy, Timmy, it's our favorite time of year.
"
14,7,Timmy,"Timmeh!
"
14,7,Jimmy,"We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Frances. Hey Frances!
"
14,7,Frances,"Hi Jimmy, hi Tim.
"
14,7,Timmy,"Timmy.
"
14,7,Specialist 1,"Wow, look at Lenora everyone.  Good job. Come on, good job Lenora. Ahahall right, good, let's get Lenora a towel.  Come on, come on, where's the towel?
"
14,7,Specialist 2,"The towel isn't here. I think it's off getting high again.
"
14,7,Specialist 3,"Hey!  Where is that towel?!
"
14,7,Towelie,"Oh yeah, just a sec. 
"
14,7,Stan,"We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!
"
14,7,Specialist 3,"What's going on, Towel?
"
14,7,Towelie,"Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.
"
14,7,Specialist 3,"We got wet campers down there! Move your ass!
"
14,7,Kyle,"When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
"
14,7,Towelie,"I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp. 
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Alright blue team. As team captain, I need to make sure we are ready for the big camp competition.
"
14,7,Jimmy,"All right! Everyone together! Are we gonna beat Red Team this year?
"
14,7,Blue Team,"Yeah!
"
14,7,Timmy,"Timmy!
"
14,7,Blue Team,"Yeah!  Alright!
"
14,7,Nathan,"I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Duhh you always hated Jimmy, boss. Ever since he whooped you at soifin' last summer camp, he really took it to you good, haha.
"
14,7,Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsssyyy!
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Doh, sorry, boss.
"
14,7,Nathan,"Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that?
"
14,7,Nathan,"What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Oh boy, we're gonna ruin Blue Team's chances, huh? We're gonna break their legs or somethin', boss?
"
14,7,Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him.
"
14,7,Specialist 1,"There you go, Lenora, all better now?
"
14,7,Lenora,"Yes, thanks.
"
14,7,Towelie,"That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... 
"
14,7,Lenora,"Uhhh!
"
14,7,Specialist 3,"Who hired that towel? It can barely walk, let alone dry somebody off.
"
14,7,Towelie,"You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!
"
14,7,Stan,"A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.
"
14,7,Towelie,"You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! 
"
14,7,Butters,"The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
"
14,7,Towelie,"Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!
"
14,7,Towelie,"No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!  Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?
"
14,7,Specialist 1,"All right, campers! Our first event is the big canoe race!
"
14,7,Nathan,"I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Darrr, oh boy, what are we gonna do, boss?
"
14,7,Nathan,"Simple, Mimsy,  We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Doh, dohhh, what kind of surprise uh?  Oh! It's a snake.
"
14,7,Nathan,"Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a black mamba.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Aww, dah, jee whiz boss, we're gonna kill all the Blue Team and Jimmy, huh? 
"
14,7,Specialist 4,"You boys excited for the canoe race?
"
14,7,Nathan,"Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe.
"
14,7,Specialist 4,"Canoes are fun, aren't day? 
"
14,7,Nathan,"Now take the Black Mamba,  Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready.
"
14,7,Specialist 1,"All right, campers are we ready?
"
14,7,All,"Yeah!
"
14,7,Nathan,"Good luck, Jimmy.
"
14,7,Jimmy,"You too, Ne-n-Nathan.
"
14,7,Nathan,"You're gonna need it, you fuckin' asshole.
"
14,7,Specialist 1,"Oh your mark, get set. 
"
14,7,Nathan,"Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Darrr, you set to put the Black Mamba in the canoe, boss.
"
14,7,Nathan,"Not in our canoe, Mimsy!
"
14,7,Steve,"Heeey. Hey, we need a towel! 
"
14,7,Towelie,"Uh, oh, um, uh, just a sec!
"
14,7,Steve,"Not just a sec! We've got a whole lot of wet campers down there!  What's going on?! 
"
14,7,Towelie,"Hey, you own me money, asshole!
"
14,7,Specialist 1,"That's it, we're done! You are no longer employed here!
"
14,7,Kyle,"Please, sir.
"
14,7,Specialist 1,"We need a nice, clean towel here at summer camp. We don't need a towel that shoots heroin and has sex for money!
"
14,7,Towelie,"Heh, some people are so picky about their towels
"
14,7,Specialist 3,"All right campers, next event is the big scavenger hunt! Blue Team is gonna go first. 
"
14,7,Nathan,"I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Oh boy, what are we gonna do to him, huh buss?
"
14,7,Nathan,"Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans.  Here, take this.  It's a fake scavenger hunt map
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dahhh, this map leads to the scavenger hunt?
"
14,7,Nathan,"No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dah-oh boy! We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Indians, huh boss? 
"
14,7,Counselor Steve,"Are you boys excited for the neat scavenger hunt?
"
14,7,Nathan,"Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt.  Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map!
"
14,7,Mimsy,"I got it, boss. Switch the map. Switch the map. 
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dah how come we're scavenger huntin' now, boss?
"
14,7,Nathan,"Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dahhhoh boy!
"
14,7,Nathan,"This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. ""Turn left at the..."" Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the?  Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation!
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Why sure it is, boss.
"
14,7,Nathan,"I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team!
"
14,7,Mimsy,"No, you told me to switch the map, switch the map, so I switched it, and I switched it. 
"
14,7,Nathan,"Miiimmmssssyyyy!  Uh, my name is Nathan. I'm disabled.  AAAAA!
"
14,7,Towelie,"Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. 
"
14,7,Cashier,"You must have one dusty computer.
"
14,7,Towelie,"Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch!  I feel like I could conquer the world.
"
14,7,Towelie,"It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine.
"
14,7,Butters,"I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!
"
14,7,Towelie,"Go away! I'm walking on sunshine!
"
14,7,Butters,"Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
"
14,7,Towelie,"Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more. 
"
14,7,Specialist 1,"All right! In the surfing competition, the Red Team is up three points to two.  And now it's Jimmy Valmer's turn. 
"
14,7,Timmy,"Timmeh!
"
14,7,Frances,"Gee, I wish our team captain was as awesome as Jimmy. 
"
14,7,Nathan,"I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Oh boy oh boy! What are we gonna do to him, boss?
"
14,7,Nathan,"Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark.  Here, take this.  It's a shark-mating whistle.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dahhh okay boss, a shark-mating whistle. We're gonna hit him over the head with it, huh boss?'
"
14,7,Nathan,"No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dahhh I've got it boss. I blow the whistle and make the shark come and bite Jimmy's legs off.  Then he bleeds to death. He's gonna bleed to death. 
"
14,7,Steve,"Are you boys enjoying the fun beach?
"
14,7,Nathan,"Yes, Counselor Steve. The beach is warm. 
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Gee that was a close one, huh boss? They almost had me saying we were gonna kill Jimmy.
"
14,7,Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just swim in the water where Jimmy is, then blow that whistle.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dohh boy! 
"
14,7,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Gonna catch a wave... 
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dahhh I got me a shark whistle.
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Oh boy, here it comes! Here it comes! 
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dohoho, oh boy!
"
14,7,Nathan,"Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dahh whattaya mean, boss? You said to swim in the water and to blow the whistle. I swam in the water, so now I'm gonna blow the whistle. 
"
14,7,Nathan,"You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it-  eh uh uh...
"
14,7,Nathan,"Mimsssyyy! Get this thing off of meee!
"
14,7,Stan,"Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
"
14,7,Butters,"Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
"
14,7,Towelie,"Wha' what's goin' on?
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"You wanna come over, have a seat with your friends? 
"
14,7,Towelie,"What is everybody doing here?
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"We've all just been talking, Towelie, and and what I'm hearing is a bunch of people here who just love the heck outtaya. And, they're gonna way what they wanna say, and you're gonna say what you wanna say, and we're done. Okay?
"
14,7,Butters,"Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
"
14,7,Towelie,"Aw Jesus, man.
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"Ah ah Towelie, you need to let him finish.
"
14,7,Butters,"You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
"
14,7,Towelie,"I I don't, I don't get this.
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"Kyle?
"
14,7,Kyle,"Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
"
14,7,Towelie,"Could we just end this please?
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"You have to let him finish, Towelie.
"
14,7,Kyle,"If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"Alright. Eric, do you wanna go next?
"
14,7,Cartman,"Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.
"
14,7,Kyle,"We're here for Towelie, fatass!
"
14,7,Cartman,"I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- 
"
14,7,Kyle,"This is serious, you fucking asshole!
"
14,7,Cartman,"I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"Kyle, we have to let people be allowed to finish during interventions.
"
14,7,Kyle,"But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"Kyle please, It is not your turn!
"
14,7,Cartman,"You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
"
14,7,Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
14,7,Jimmy,"It's a snap at Tardicaca Camp to learn to do the hula hula danceI fell in love with a Tardicaca dove while doin' that funny funny dance.And that poor little kid, why she never did know what love had in store.So I made up my mind-
"
14,7,Nathan,"Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.
"
14,7,Jimmy,"So I made up my mind that I've just got to find the Tardicaca girl I did adore.
"
14,7,Campers,"Wawawawander...
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Hurr a little Tardicaca...
"
14,7,Campers,"Hula...
"
14,7,Jimmy,"She's a candy cane to wiggle
"
14,7,Campers,"Hula...
"
14,7,Jimmy,"She's sure to make you g-giggle.
"
14,7,Campers,"Hula...
"
14,7,Jimmy,"With her naughty little wiggle. I know someday
"
14,7,Campers,"Hula...
"
14,7,Jimmy,"I'm gonna try to make that Tardicaca gally mine, gally mine.'Cause all the while I'm dreaming of her. My Tardicaca Hola Gal!
Oh sorry, that's not right. Hang on. '
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dahh I don't think he's playing the right note, boss. The C4 aint gonna go off.
"
14,7,Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsssyyy!
"
14,7,Cartman,"If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. 
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"Okay, Stan, you want to go next?
"
14,7,Stan,"Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?
"
14,7,Towel,"What treatment?! What are you all talkin' about?!
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"If you say yes, we leave here, pack your things, get on a plane, go to a treatment facility in Southern California, it's all set up.
"
14,7,Towelie,"No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends.
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"Well Towelie, your friends don't wanna watch you kill yourself anymore.
"
14,7,Towelie,"Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here! 
"
14,7,Butters,"Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
"
14,7,Towelie,"Who are you talkin' about?!  Washcloth? You, you brought Washcloth?! Oh, that's low.
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Out on the beach with my cute little peach where the waves are rolling in so highHolding her hand, our feet on the sand-
"
14,7,Nathan,"Dammit dammit!
"
14,7,Nathan,"Mimsy, get out there and demand the ukulele solo. It's our only chance.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dahh okay boss. 
"
14,7,Jimmy,"If you get in a pinch, go through, it's a cinch-
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Darrr we want the ukulele solo! We want the ukulele solo!
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Sorry Mims, I I just can't remember it.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Well we wants ya to play it, don't we?
"
14,7,Nathan,"Yeeeah!
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Alright Mimsy, m-maybe you can show me how it's done. 
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dahh okay. It's real easy. You just play it like this. 
"
14,7,Nathan,"Mimsssyyy! You idio', wha' are you doin'?
"
14,7,Mimsy,"D'I was gonna show him how to play the solo, boss.
"
14,7,Nathan,"That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself!  AAAAAAAA!
"
14,7,Nathan,"Uuuh!  AAAH!  No, not the shark again! Not the shark again!
"
14,7,Towelie,"Oh no, oh Washcloth, I'm so sorry.
"
14,7,Butters,"He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"You've got so many people that just love the heck out of ya, Towelie. 
"
14,7,Towelie,"All right. All right, I'll go.
"
14,7,Butters,"You will?
"
14,7,Towelie,"I don't wanna hurt Washcloth anymore.
"
14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"He's goin', everybody. Hugs! 
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Nathan, your team put up an amazing fight. And even though I was crowned the King of Cripple Camp, I want you to know that you were the real ch-cha, champ.
"
14,7,Nathan,"I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being.
"
14,7,Mimsy,"Dahhh you sure got it stuck it to you this year, boss.
"
14,7,Nathan,"Shut up... Mimsssyyy. 
"
14,7,Counselor,"Hi, Towelie?
"
14,7,Towelie,"Yeah, hi.
"
14,7,Counselor,"Towelie is definitely one of the most addicted towels we've ever seen here. He's probably the second most psychologically damaged towel I've come across since treating Kirstie Alley's towel, which, had seen some... uuff, some nasty stuff.
"
14,7,Towelie,"I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel.
"
14,7,Singer,"Veins swell
You know me, Ellen
Enough to tell
Five steps, you're over
"
14,8,Stan,"Cartman, dude, what's wrong?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?
"
14,8,Kyle,"Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.
"
14,8,Cartman,"It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
"
14,8,Kyle,"""What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up""?
"
14,8,Cartman,"I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! 
"
14,8,Stan,"Why not?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
"
14,8,Stan,"Cartman, tell us.
"
14,8,Cartman,"No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 
"
14,8,Stan,"Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? 
"
14,8,Kyle,"Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
"
14,8,Cartman,"No I can't; I'll always be like this. 
"
14,8,Stan,"Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 
"
14,8,Kyle,"What?!
"
14,8,Cartman,"I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
"
14,8,Stan,"Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(What?)
"
14,8,Cartman,"You love NASCAR huh?
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Yeah dude, I looove NASCAR.)
"
14,8,Cartman,"You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! 
"
14,8,Kyle,"Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
"
14,8,Cartman,"I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. 
"
14,8,Stan,"Dude, you are so retarded!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
"
14,8,Kyle,"How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
"
14,8,Cartman,"You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. 
"
14,8,Kyle,"I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Butters.
"
14,8,Butters,"Hey Eric.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!
"
14,8,Butters,"Ahhh well oh- kay.
"
14,8,Cartman,"But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??
"
14,8,Butters,"Eeyeah, I'm psyched.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Get really psyched up, Butters!
"
14,8,Butters,"I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
"
14,8,Cartman,"I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
"
14,8,Butters,"NASCA- NASCAR?
"
14,8,Cartman,"I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
"
14,8,Butters,"You're givin' away all your money??
"
14,8,Cartman,"Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
"
14,8,Butters,"You sure you want to do this?
"
14,8,Cartman,"I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
"
14,8,Spokesman,"Alright folks, we wanna thank you all for comin' out an' supporting NASCAR.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Yeah! How cool!)
"
14,8,Spokesman,"How who's ready for Saturday's big race? 
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
14,8,Spokesman,"We're really excited to be part of the fastest-growing sport in America! 
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
14,8,Spokesman,"I don't know about you, but I'm thrilled to watch NASCAR finally becoming recognized as a respected, legitimate sport. 
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Yeah! Yeeaahh!)
"
14,8,Butters,"Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 
"
14,8,Man 1,"Boy I tell you what, it is raining cats and dogs outside. Mostly cats.  I just wish I had brought an umbrella.
"
14,8,Butters,"Hey Eric.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
"
14,8,Butters,"Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
"
14,8,Cartman,"I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.
"
14,8,Charlie,"Hey- hey, there's a hot girl over there. 
"
14,8,Jake,"Sure she's hot. She's wearing a sweater. 
"
14,8,Butters,"Feel stupid yet?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Not yet.
"
14,8,Woman 1,"When a woman isn't feeling her freshest, she turns to Vagisil-
"
14,8,Cartman,"Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!
"
14,8,Woman 1,"To stop feminine itching, and relieve vaginal odors.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Fucking gross!
"
14,8,Butters,"All those ladies have stinky vaginas?
"
14,8,Woman 1,"If you develop an allergic reaction, see your doctor. In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.
"
14,8,Woman 2,"For the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  ""In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.""  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!
"
14,8,Cartman,"""Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes.""
"
14,8,Butters,"Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
"
14,8,Butters,"Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?
"
14,8,Cartman,"I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
"
14,8,Butters,"But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?
"
14,8,Butters,"No, you're good. 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 
"
14,8,Woman 3,"Little boy, what are you doing? 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!
"
14,8,Butters,"Really?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
"
14,8,Butters,"That was fast.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
"
14,8,Announcer,"We're just seconds away from the start of the Denver 300. 
"
14,8,Butters,"Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.
"
14,8,Dale,"What?
"
14,8,Butters,"Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
"
14,8,Dale,"Oh my God! 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 
"
14,8,Butters,"Eric, are you sure you can do this?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.
"
14,8,Announcer,"Let the race begin!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.
"
14,8,Butters,"I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
"
14,8,Cartman,"What's that?
"
14,8,Butters,"There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh okay.  Let's go NASCAR! 
"
14,8,Announcer,"It looks like the Dale Evans car is going the wrong way!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh, fuck my ass! 
"
14,8,Butters,"Eric?
"
14,8,Cartman,"All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
"
14,8,Butters,"Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
"
14,8,Butters,"Eric! Don't ever talk like that!
"
14,8,Cartman,"I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
"
14,8,Doctor,"Alright Eric, we got the X-rays back.
"
14,8,Butters,"How bad is it, doctor?
"
14,8,Doctor,"He has two fractured ribs, a broken femur, torn ligaments in both knees, and a lever 2 concussion. He also appears to be developing three small vaginas in his stomach, but they are all sparkling clean.
"
14,8,Butters,"Well at least there's that.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
"
14,8,Doctor,"You aren't on life-support. Pulling a plug wouldn't do anything.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Aw donkey balls...
"
14,8,Doctor,"You're lucky to be alive, young man. Sneaking onto a NASCAR racetrack and hijacking a car for a joyride? That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of a kid doing! 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
"
14,8,Doctor,"No, really. Of all the idiotic dumb ways I've seen kids injure themselves, yours takes the retard cake! 
"
14,8,Butters,"Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
"
14,8,Butters,"It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. 
"
14,8,FOX 11 Anchor,"You're watching Colorado FOX 11. Next on FOX 11 News, are NASCAR fans stupid?  Some people are starting to wonder after a NASCAR fan apparently got high on Vagisil and snuck onto the track, killing eleven people.
"
14,8,Reporter,"Tom, the NASCAR fan got into a car here on Sunday and crashed in the lake behind me. He was later found to have ingested this  Maximum Strength Vagisil. And also Vagisil medicated wipes. Making NASCAR fans look ...pretty stupid, Tom.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(No! NASCAR fans aren't stupid! Cartman is!)
"
14,8,Reporter,"The NASCAR fan vows he will try to do it again, but that this time, he'll win.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh hey, Kenny.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)
"
14,8,Cartman,"Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? 
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Dude, fuck you!)
"
14,8,Cartman,"Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
"
14,8,Cartman,"Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(No you fucking don't!)
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
14,8,Cartman,"I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
"
14,8,Man,"Uh, excuse me.  Eric Cartman?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Yeah?
"
14,8,Man,"My name is Geoff Hamill. I'm the founder and CEO of Vagisil.
"
14,8,Cartman,"...Uh oh.
"
14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Young man, your NASCAR stunt has brought a lot of attention to Vagisil and honestly, I don't know how to thank you. Our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated. I first created Vagisil for my wife, Patty. She's my Muse, my flame. We realized that NASCAR can do a lot for product recognition and so, Vagisil has a little present... for you. 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!
"
14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Vagisil would like you to represent us in the next NASCAR race.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(No fucking way!)
"
14,8,Geoff Hamill,"And we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 
"
14,8,Announcer,"We are now live at the NASCAR press conference, where the drivers of Saturday's race are gearing up and taking questions from reporters.
"
14,8,Reporter 1,"So uh what's your guys' take on the track here? Any concerns? 
"
14,8,Jimmie Johnson,"Well I think it's a fine track, you know. The- the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems-
"
14,8,Cartman,"Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.
"
14,8,Reporter 2,"Uhhh they're saying hot weather tomorrow; any concerns about restrictor plate or brake plate problems?
"
14,8,Jeff Gordon,"Of course, any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid, but the plates themselves-
"
14,8,Cartman,"Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
"
14,8,"Dale Earnhardt, Jr.","Hey excuse me, who is this kid? Is he even a driver?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
"
14,8,Danica Patrick,"Can we just, get back to the subject of racing, please?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
"
14,8,Butters,"You seemed really stupid, Eric.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
"
14,8,Tony Kornheiser,"Alright, from the NFL we now turn to the world of NASCAR! People who weren't sure what to think of NASCAR are more sure today after a NASCAR driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this ""Obama"" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.
"
14,8,Butters,"Obama's fuckin' gay.
"
14,8,Cartman,"He's fuckin' gay as hell!
"
14,8,Butters,"Pissin' me off!
"
14,8,Cartman,"So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!
"
14,8,Tony Kornheiser,"Well if you ask me, that's all the proof we need that NASCAR really is just for the poor...  and the stupid.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Fuck this!) 
"
14,8,Commentator 1,"The stage is set for what could be the most important race of the NASCAR year.
"
14,8,Commentator 2,"Lots of speculation and interest in the Vagisil car, driven by Eric Cartman. We are joined now by the inventor and owner of Vagisil, Geoff Hamill.
"
14,8,Geoff,"Thank you, Chris.
"
14,8,Chris,"Yeah, but why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?
"
14,8,Geoff,"Vagisil is very excited to be a part of the NASCAR phenomenon, Chris. You know, I... first created Vagisil to try and help my wife, Patty. She is my Muse, my flame. Wherever Patty goes her smile lights up the room. Her vagina, on the other hand, clears the room and makes it uninhabitable for weeks.
"
14,8,Commentator 1,"Ohkay, well the race is about to start, so why don't we kick it back down to the track?
"
14,8,Announcer,"Gentlemen, start your engines! 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Alright, ""start your engine."" What's that mean?
"
14,8,Pit Crewman,"That means you flip the switch that says ""Engine.""  Is he stupid or what?
"
14,8,Butters,"Yeah, he's a champion alright.
"
14,8,Security Guard,"Check your bag please, sir?  No, no, see, this won't do. You can't bring a sniper rifle onto the track.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Aww, come on!)
"
14,8,Security Guard,"Look, NASCAR is trying to change its image. It's people like you that are givin' NASCAR a bad name!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Aw come on, fuck you!) 
"
14,8,Security Guard,"You might be able to buy one in the gift shop. 
"
14,8,Announcer,"The drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!
"
14,8,Pit Crewman,"This is just the pace lap, you don't go full speed yet!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! 
"
14,8,Danica Patrick,"The fuck are you doing?!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! 
"
14,8,Danica Patrick,"Oh, son of a bitch!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
"
14,8,Commentator 1,"And it looks like the Vagisil car has already clipped two other drivers and taken them out of the race.
"
14,8,Chris,"Yes, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?
"
14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product, Chris. We want women to know that Vagisil is effective, safe for use every day,  Every. Day.  Every. Day.  And available nationwide.
"
14,8,Butters,"Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah, I see it. 
"
14,8,Danica Patrick,"AAAAAA! 
"
14,8,Cartman,"You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
"
14,8,Butters,"That's fuckin' gay as hell.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!
"
14,8,Butters,"There you go. You're back on the track.
"
14,8,Cartman,"I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Stop this car!)
"
14,8,Cartman,"Get off my car, Kenny!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Stop this car right now!)
"
14,8,Butters,"Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
"
14,8,Cartman,"We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(I fucking hate you!)
"
14,8,Cartman,"Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 
"
14,8,Kenny,"(AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...) 
"
14,8,Driver,"Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track. 
"
14,8,Chris,"Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill.
"
14,8,Geoff Hamill,"This is such a great day for Vagisil, Chris. Our product awareness will be at an all-time high. Feminine odor must be treated diligently.  Very. Diligently.  Patty? Patty?
"
14,8,Announcer,"It looks like a woman is trying to take over for Jimmie Johnson's car. 
"
14,8,Geoff Hamill,"What? 
"
14,8,Lowes Pit Boss,"Ma'am? You are on an active racetrack. This is extremely dangerous.
"
14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Let me talk to her.  Patty? Patty, what are you doing?  Patty, pull over the NASCAR. You're acting irrationally. Patty, did you forget to take your medication? You know how you get when you don't use your Vagisil. There should be some in your purse, my Muse. Patty? 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.
"
14,8,Butters,"I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Fuckin' gay as hell. 
"
14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Patty, you are my Muse, and my flame.
"
14,8,Announcer,"They are neck and neck approaching the finish line. 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh, fuck my ass again! 
"
14,8,Geoff Hamill,"HAAAAAAAAAA!
"
14,8,Announcer,"Big celebration for the Lowe's Home Improvement team.
"
14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Patty! How could you?! You've ruined us! You've ruined Vagisil!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(HA! You fucking lose!)
"
14,8,Cartman,"No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
"
14,8,Butters,"Huh?
"
14,8,Cartman,"The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
"
14,8,Butters,"Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
"
14,8,Butters,"But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, what's ""muff cabbage""? 
"
14,9,Gerald,"Muff cabbage?
"
14,9,Sheila,"Where did you hear that?
"
14,9,Ike,"Muff cabbage!
"
14,9,Kyle,"The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop ""muff cabbage"".
"
14,9,Ike,"Muff cabbage.
"
14,9,Sheila,"A new family moved in? Where are they from?
"
14,9,Kyle,"She said they're from New Jersey.
"
14,9,Sheila,"New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
"
14,9,Kyle,"Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
"
14,9,Sheila,"Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know?
"
14,9,Kyle,"Know what, Ma?
"
14,9,Ike,"Muff cabbage!
"
14,9,Sheila,"Never invite a New Jersey housewife in your home.
"
14,9,Teresa,"And so then I met the school principal. What's her name? Principal Victoria? What a stupid bitch! I mean, excuse my language, but that bitch needs her fuckin' head examined!
"
14,9,Teresa,"Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me.
"
14,9,Teresa,"Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name?
"
14,9,Sharon,"Oh, Linda, huh?
"
14,9,Teresa,"Have you noticed how yellow that bitch's teeth are? You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage. She's garbage!  I went into the mall here and I just about dropped dead. The only panties you can buy makes you look like you have a grandma muff! Where's the Gucci? Where's the Prada? Have they heard of Italian clothes? It's ridiculous!
"
14,9,Joe,"So Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?
"
14,9,Randy,"I don't really work out.
"
14,9,Joe,"Well, I gotta find somethin'.  My biceps are goin' flat.
"
14,9,Teresa,"Where can you get good clothes in this town?! Nowhere! I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right? And the woman that works the hair salon? Julia? Have you seen how big that bitch's ears are?
"
14,9,Sharon,"Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah.
"
14,9,Teresa,"Ears out to here!  So I tell her, ""You got big ears, sweetie."" I'm not trying to be mean. It's just a Jersey thing. Why be offended? I mean, you've got a big chin. We've all got imperfections.
"
14,9,Sharon,"Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. 
"
14,9,Teresa,"That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No.
"
14,9,Teresa,"You don't ever, ever! You whack job, prostitution...  ...whore! You probably sell your muff...  ...for six dollars! You fucking psycho bitch! Fuck you!  You're nothin' but garbage!  That's what you are! You're garbage!  You sick, old woman! Muff garbage!  Muff cabbage! Fuck this psycho bitch!
"
14,9,Sharon,"Wow.
"
14,9,Teresa,"Let's get the fuck outta here! She's a fuckin' pig! She's fuckin' pissin' me off! Okay, I love you.
"
14,9,Joe,"Take it easy.
"
14,9,Teresa,"I love you.  I love you.
"
14,9,Teresa,"I thought I was gonna deck her. I was fine. I was really fine. I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am.  Like I could be mad one minute and then I'll be fine.
"
14,9,Teresa,"Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Me!
"
14,9,Stan,"You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
"
14,9,Cartman,"You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
"
14,9,Cartman,"Oops, busted. 
"
14,9,Stan,"They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, ""Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing.""
"
14,9,Jersey Man,"Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Aw, crap, there's more of them?
"
14,9,Jersey Man,"'Ey, come on, there's people from Jersey all over! Who here is from Jersey? 
"
14,9,"Steve ""Last Call""","So I'm like standin' there, and I'm like, ""Who's from Jersey?"", and people are all like, ""Yo! Woo-hoo!"" Next thing you know, Jersey party at Sizzler. 
"
14,9,Woman,"Yeah, let's get this party started. 
"
14,9,Kyle,"Where the hell are they coming from?! 
"
14,9,Teresa,"Danielle was being a stupid bitch.
"
14,9,Woman 1,"Shut up, Teresa. You're pathetic!
"
14,9,Teresa,"I'm pathetic? You're muff gabbage!  Oh, Sharon!  Hi, sweetie. You gotta meet our new neighbors. This is Jacqueline. She's from Jersey.
"
14,9,Jacqueline,"And Sicilian.
"
14,9,Teresa,"That's Danielle. She's from Jersey.  And that's Caroline.
"
14,9,Caroline,"I'm having my face shaved. It's a Jersey thing.
"
14,9,Salon Girl,"I'm sorry, but I have other clients in ten minutes. Can you sit down? 
"
14,9,Jacqueline,"When the salon girl told Teresa to sit down, I thought Teresa was gonna bust a tit.
"
14,9,Teresa,"Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here!
"
14,9,Caroline,"Teresa! Calm down.
"
14,9,Salon Girl,"I don't have to take your shit! I'm from Jersey!
"
14,9,Teresa,"Get her, Sharon!
"
14,9,Sharon,"What?
"
14,9,Jacqueline,"Sharon, just stay out of it!
"
14,9,Caroline,"Be the bigger person, Sharon!
"
14,9,Sharon,"You people are crazy.
"
14,9,Caroline,"Who's crazy? Are you talkin' about my family?!  Is my family crazy?!
"
14,9,Teresa,"Don't you pull my friend's hair, you bitch! 
"
14,9,Sheila,"Let go of her, you piece of trash! 
"
14,9,Teresa,"Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?!
"
14,9,Sheila,"All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!
"
14,9,Teresa,"Psycho bitch!
"
14,9,Sheila,"No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho bitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! 
"
14,9,Jacqueline,"You're cabbage! 
"
14,9,Sharon,"Sheila?
"
14,9,Randy,"People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. 
"
14,9,Mr. Garrison,"Jesus! Why are they doing this?
"
14,9,Randy,"More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
"
14,9,Jimbo,"Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!
"
14,9,All,"Yeah!
"
14,9,Sheila,"That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.
"
14,9,Jimbo,"How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski? 
"
14,9,Sheila,"That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang.  I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face.  Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.
"
14,9,Sharon,"Sheila, who are you talking to?
"
14,9,Sheila,"You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing. 
"
14,9,Cartman,"You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
"
14,9,Kyle,"Hey, dudes.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
"
14,9,Kyle,"What are you talking about?
"
14,9,Cartman,"Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
"
14,9,Kyle,"So what?
"
14,9,Cartman,"So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
"
14,9,Kyle,"No, it doesn't!
"
14,9,Cartman,"He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.
"
14,9,Kyle,"I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
"
14,9,Kyle,"What's strike three?!
"
14,9,Cartman,"You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
"
14,9,Kyle,"Shut the fuck up!  What?
"
14,9,Stan,"Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
"
14,9,Kyle,"Why does it matter?!
"
14,9,Stan,"No, uh, it just explains a lot.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
"
14,9,Kyle,"No, it isn't!
"
14,9,Cartman,"Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
"
14,9,Stan,"Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
"
14,9,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
14,9,Cartman,"Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
"
14,9,Kyle,"No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God.
"
14,9,Sheila,"Kyle? You in there?
"
14,9,Kyle,"Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 
"
14,9,Sheila,"Kyle, open the door.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Not now, Mom. Please.
"
14,9,Sheila,"Kyle, this instant! One, two. 
"
14,9,Kyle,"All right, all right. 
"
14,9,Sheila,"I guess we need to talk.
"
14,9,Sheila,"I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.
"
14,9,Kyle,"What am I, Mom?
"
14,9,Sheila,"When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.
"
14,9,Kyle,"What are you saying?!
"
14,9,Sheila,"I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.
"
14,9,Kyle,"No! I don't wanna look like this!
"
14,9,Sheila,"It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.
"
14,9,Ike,"Aaaahhhhh! 
"
14,9,Kyle,"I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!
"
14,9,Announcer,"Live from St. Louis, New Jersey! It's the ""Jersey News"" with anchormen P-Train and Tan Jovi!
"
14,9,P-Train,"What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago.
"
14,9,Reporter,"People here in Chicago, New Jersey are riled up, P-Train. Apparently, a town called South Park, which is at the border of Denver, New Jersey, is discriminating against people from Jersey! They won't sell houses to people from Jersey, and they're making all the ones who moved in move out.  And they're takin' down all the Jersey-owned shops!  It's like these people got a beef with Jersey. What's up with that?!
"
14,9,Tan Jovi,"What's up with that?!
"
14,9,P-Train,"What's up with that?!
"
14,9,Tan Jovi,"Well, we are coming after you, South Park! We fight discrimination! It's a Jersey thing!
"
14,9,Randy,"Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.
"
14,9,Schwarzenegger,"We are very sorry, but California cannot afford helping you at this time.
"
14,9,Randy,"Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
"
14,9,Schwarzenegger,"No, because Utah is between Colorado and California.
"
14,9,Randy,"Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!
"
14,9,Schwarzenegger,"Nevada.
"
14,9,Randy,"Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!
"
14,9,Cartman,"What the hell are you guys doing?!
"
14,9,Stan,"Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
"
14,9,Cartman,"And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!
"
14,9,Kyle,"I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
"
14,9,Cartman,"Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
"
14,9,Kyle,"That's enough!
"
14,9,Cartman,"Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
"
14,9,Kyle,"Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
"
14,9,Cartman,"That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!
"
14,9,Randy,"Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!
"
14,9,Stuart,"We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
"
14,9,Randy,"There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.
"
14,9,Mr. Garrison,"What are you talking about?
"
14,9,Randy,"We could ask Al Qaeda.
"
14,9,Stephen,"Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!
"
14,9,Randy,"Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
"
14,9,Stephen,"And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!
"
14,9,Bar Patron 1,"Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bad quick! There's trouble!
"
14,9,Randy,"People from Jersey?
"
14,9,Bar Patron 1,"I don't know what the hell I saw.
"
14,9,Skeeter,"It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed a cigarette machine in half.
"
14,9,Barbrady,"Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. 
"
14,9,Bar Patron 2,"It's one of them! That thing's from Jersey, too! 
"
14,9,Randy,"What is it?
"
14,9,Bar Patron 2,"It's called a Snooki. It's very famous. 
"
14,9,Randy,"That thing is famous? Why?
"
14,9,Bar Patron 2,"I don't know!
"
14,9,Jimbo,"Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! 
"
14,9,Snooki,"Snooki.
"
14,9,Randy,"Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?! 
"
14,9,Stephen,"Aaagh! Get it off of me!
"
14,9,Snooki,"Snooki smoosh.
"
14,9,Stephen,"Shoot it! 
"
14,9,Cartman,"So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, ""I'll smash your teeth in!"" My head is all like gashed open.
"
14,9,Butters,"Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
"
14,9,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
"
14,9,Butters,"Are you being serious?
"
14,9,Cartman,"This is very serious, Butters.
"
14,9,Butters,"Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
"
14,9,Operative,"Istagia makuman? 
"
14,9,Randy,"Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. 
"
14,9,Snooki,"Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Come on, you guys, hurry!
"
14,9,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
"
14,9,Cartman,"I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
"
14,9,Kenny,"(What kind of fuckin' miracle?!) 
"
14,9,Cartman,"Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Why?
"
14,9,Cartman,"Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
"
14,9,Kyle,"You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
"
14,9,Kyle,"I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
"
14,9,Cartman,"Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! 
"
14,9,Stan,"Dude, what are you doing?
"
14,9,Cartman,"Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
"
14,9,Kyle,"All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
"
14,9,Cartman,"Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
"
14,9,Kyle,"No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?
"
14,9,Cartman,"You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!
"
14,9,Snooki,"Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
"
14,9,Stephen,"Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?
"
14,9,Mr. Garrison,"He's still questioning that new prisoner.
"
14,9,Randy,"Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!
"
14,9,The Situation,"Well, I told you, it's, uh, just a Jersey thing. 
"
14,9,Randy,"What does that mean?!
"
14,9,The Situation,"You just don't understand. It's, uh, it's just... just a Jersey thing. 
"
14,9,Randy,"Stop playing stupid!
"
14,9,Jimbo,"Maybe he really is stupid, Randy.
"
14,9,Randy,"Nobody's this stupid!  What are you people planning?!
"
14,9,The Situation,"It's just a Jersey thing, you know? You...you just gotta be from Jersey to get it. 
"
14,9,Gerald,"Here they come! 
"
14,9,Sharon,"Is it them, Randy?
"
14,9,Randy,"Yup. They're from Jersey alright.
"
14,9,Jersey People,"Yeah! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Yeah!
"
14,9,Jersey Man 2,"Let's go creepin' in this town!
"
14,9,Jersey Woman,"Don't you talk about my family! Don't you talk about my family!
"
14,9,Randy,"This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 
"
14,9,Randy,"Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!
"
14,9,DogPoo,"Ugh! Ugh! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
"
14,9,Snooki,"Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
"
14,9,Stan,"Try to find a way past it!
"
14,9,Cartman,"What does it want?!
"
14,9,Butters,"Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.
"
14,9,Snooki,"Smoosh smoosh. Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
"
14,9,Cartman,"No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
"
14,9,Stan,"Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
"
14,9,Kyle,"Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!
"
14,9,Stan,"Why? 
"
14,9,Kyle,"Agggh! Agggh!  No! 
"
14,9,Stan,"Dude.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
"
14,9,Snooki,"Snooki just, uh, smoosh in the... the tenth...
"
14,9,Kyle,"You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
"
14,9,Cartman,"Thank you, Kyle.
"
14,9,Jimbo,"That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
"
14,9,Randy,"Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
"
14,9,Stuart,"What's the point? Can't you see it's over? 
"
14,9,Jimbo,"Who is that?! 
"
14,9,Randy,"It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! 
"
14,9,Randy,"On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, ""Go away!"" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. 
"
14,9,Stan,"Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.
"
14,9,Stan,"I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling ""Muff cabbage,"" what's muff cabbage?
"
14,9,Kyle,"It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
"
14,9,Randy,"On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. 
"
14,9,Paratrooper,"Tango is down, tango is down.
"
14,9,Randy,"We got him!
"
14,10,Cartman,"So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. 
"
14,10,Butters,"Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
"
14,10,Stan,"A note?
"
14,10,Butters,"Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 
"
14,10,Kyle,"What's it say?
"
14,10,Stan,"We need to talk.
"
14,10,Cartman,"Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says ""We need to talk"" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.
"
14,10,Red,"Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy?
"
14,10,Wendy,"Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called ""hoarding."" People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.
"
14,10,Stan,"Is something wrong, Wendy? 
"
14,10,Wendy,"Stan? We need to talk about your locker.
"
14,10,Stan,"My locker?
"
14,10,Wendy,"Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.
"
14,10,Stan,"Are you serious?
"
14,10,Wendy,"It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.
"
14,10,Stan,"Well it's just a little messy.
"
14,10,Wendy,"No, Stan, it's called ""hoarding""! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!
"
14,10,Stan,"Aw come on.
"
14,10,Wendy,"Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?
"
14,10,Stan,"Yeah, alright.
"
14,10,Wendy,"Okay.  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.
"
14,10,An Expert,"Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Chinstrap. I'm a hoarding specialist, and today we're gonna help Stan clean out his locker. Alright, let's go ahead and see inside your locker, Stan. 
"
14,10,Stan,"What, come on, it's not that bad.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out.
"
14,10,Stan,"My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Okay, great. How about we start with this? 
"
14,10,Stan,"Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Okay, okay, we'll put that right here on the floor. Now how about this?  Broken toothbrush.
"
14,10,Stan,"Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"But it's broken.
"
14,10,Stan,"Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Okay, okay. Broken toothbrush is going right here, by the pencil box.  Now how about this?  Old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots.
"
14,10,Class,"Eeeeewwww! 
"
14,10,Stan,"Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?
"
14,10,Stan,"Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?
"
14,10,Stan,"Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? 
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Now how about this empty aspirin bottle?
"
14,10,Stan,"Well no, don't throw that out.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Can we throw out these wadded up papers, then? 
"
14,10,Stan,"No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 
"
14,10,Kyle,"Dude. What's wrong with you?
"
14,10,Stan,"I don't... I don't know.
"
14,10,Kyle,"Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter? 
"
14,10,Stan,"Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... ""hoarding.""
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Hoarding? M'kay, what's that?
"
14,10,Stan,"Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay?
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Me? ...Like, like what?
"
14,10,Stan,"Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! M'KAY?!
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"There's no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he's easily a Class-3.
"
14,10,Principal Victoria,"But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?
"
14,10,Sharon,"Yeah, our son has always been fairly clean.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"We don't know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it's okay with you, we'd like to run some tests on the both of them.
"
14,10,Sharon,"Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"I don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is.  It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats.
"
14,10,Randy,"Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Oh no, really?
"
14,10,Sgt. Yates,"Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.
"
14,10,Mr. Yelman,"...Well I, that is I, I-
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"It's okay, Mr. Yelman, I'm a hoarding specialist. What you have is an illness. 
"
14,10,Partner,"Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Dr. Chinstrap is a professional at memory regression. This should prove very helpful.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it's office hoarding or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals.
"
14,10,Mr. Yelman,"Excuse me, but uh, I am a sheep herder.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"It's pronounced ""hoarder,"" and yes you are.
"
14,10,Mr. Yelman,"But but I, uh I'm actually herding sheep.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Yes, you are herding sheep by hoarding them, aren't you? It's good you realize that.
"
14,10,Mr. Yelman,"No, but I just thought that-
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Now listen: there's a psychological reason you're all doing this, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. We're gonna do some regression therapy. I'll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past.
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uhkay?
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I want the three of you to relax, and think about... a cloud. A lone cloud... floating... changing... Light... cool air... blowing on the cloud. Float-  WAAH! HAAA! HAAA!
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"What?! What?! Jesus, what?!
"
14,10,Mr. Yelman,"Oh my God!
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Sorry, I just got a weird gas bubble for a second.  Anyway, A lone cloud... floating... wisps of cool air... Now the cloud is near you. You... you reach out to it.
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay...
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"It's the cloud of your memories, of your past.  Your childhood perhaps. What do you see in the cloud? Who is in the cloud?
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Billy. Billy Thompson?
"
14,10,Billy,"There he is! Hey, Mackey! 
"
14,10,Mackey,"Oh uh, hi Billy. Nice to see ya, m'kay?
"
14,10,Billy,"Come 'ere! 
"
14,10,Mackey,"Uh well, actually I need to get home, m'kay? I uh...
"
14,10,Billy,"You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.
"
14,10,Mackey,"Oh well uh, uh... smoking's bad, uhkay?  Huhhhhh!
"
14,10,Billy,"You're gonna die Mackey!  Hold his legs!  Come back here!
"
14,10,Mackey,"Okay. Okay, okay okay, it's okay. It's okay. Calm down, okay. Turn on the light. 
"
14,10,Stan,"What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?
"
14,10,Mackey,"Shh. Be quiet.
"
14,10,Mr. Yelman,"'Scuse me, where are we?
"
14,10,Mackey,"Shh. You've goota be quiet. Billy Thompson's out there.
"
14,10,Stan,"What the hell's going on?!
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"What the hell is going on?!
"
14,10,Partner,"The counselor's flat top readers are calculating with the boy's and the sheep hoarder's.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Oh Jesus.
"
14,10,Randy,"What does that mean?
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.
"
14,10,Randy,"What?!
"
14,10,Partner,"I'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream.
"
14,10,Randy,"Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"It's not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I'll provide the background.
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"Alright.  Look, it is possible to enter into someone else's dreams.  Send dream trackers to go into a person's subconscious, like a spy seeing their dreams as they see them. Perhaps even planting ideas. If one person is regressing deeply enough, the dream can actually envelop those dreaming around the first person I talked about who's dreaming! And then, everyone in the dream would be in danger of never coming back. 
"
14,10,Mackey,"Yay, my bedroom! Yep, this is my happy place, m'kay?
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey.
"
14,10,Mackey,"Lite Brite, making things with light. What a sight, making things with Lite Brite, m'kay.
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?
"
14,10,Mackey,"Well this is a Lite Brite, m'kay. I can make things with light, like um, birds, m'kay, clowns, m'kay.
"
14,10,Stan,"Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!
"
14,10,Mackey,"Oh yeah, my Evel Knievel doll!  I can take the motorcycle, hm'kay, I put it on this thing, like this.  Okay now crank it back, and now I let go.  Okay. Okay.
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
"
14,10,Mackey,"Hey, look what's on! It's ZOOM!
"
14,10,Mr. Yelman,"Excuse me, I really need to get back to my sheep.
"
14,10,Stan,"I'm working on it!
"
14,10,Mackey,"Write Zoom Z Double O M Box 350 Bos-ton Mass. Oooh two ooone three fouuur, m'kay!
"
14,10,Stan,"Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! 
"
14,10,Billy,"You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is a field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget!
"
14,10,Mackey,"No, uh Billy, please, ukay? I'm really sorry about the smoking thing, uh.
"
14,10,Billy,"See you in the woods tomorrow, dead man! 
"
14,10,Mackey,"Oh Jesus...
"
14,10,Stan,"Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
"
14,10,Mackey,"Yeah, it's probably gonna be bad, m'kay. 
"
14,10,Stan,"Ohhhhhhh.
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Ohhhhhhh, m'kay.
"
14,10,Randy,"What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen.
"
14,10,Randy,"That does it! 
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"What are you doing?!
"
14,10,Randy,"I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state!
"
14,10,Randy,"Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous!
"
14,10,Randy,"I said get me in there!
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Alright, you wanna risk your ass?! Fine!  You see a cloud, it's a fluffy cloud, floating, happy, happy fluffy cloud. You reach out to it.
"
14,10,Randy,"Ahhh.
"
14,10,Bus Driver,"Alright kids, everyone on the bus.
"
14,10,Stan,"Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
"
14,10,Mackey,"It's the day of the big field trip.
"
14,10,Billy,"Come on, Mackey. We're waitin' for ya.
"
14,10,Mackey,"Oh Jesus.
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
"
14,10,Bus Driver,"Everyone on the bus now! We're runnin' late!
"
14,10,Mr. Yelman,"Excuse me, I'm actually a sheep herder.
"
14,10,Driver,"It's pronounced ""hoarder,"" young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! 
"
14,10,Mr. Yelman,"Yes, but I, I'm so- wah- um.
"
14,10,Stan,"Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
"
14,10,Randy,"Stan?  Stan!
"
14,10,Stan,"Dad? Is that you?
"
14,10,Randy,"Yes, it's me, Stan.
"
14,10,Stan,"Where are you?
"
14,10,Randy,"It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly!
"
14,10,Stan,"The hell are you doing, dad?
"
14,10,Randy,"I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
"
14,10,Stan,"Did you come here to help me?
"
14,10,Randy,"I was gonna, but oh! This is fun!
"
14,10,Stan,"Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
"
14,10,Randy,"Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.
"
14,10,Stan,"DAD!
"
14,10,Randy,"Aah ahhh aha ahhh.
"
14,10,Stan,"Aaaaaagh!
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"Uh oh, something's wrong.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"What is it?!
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"The father. He's gone completely off chart.
"
14,10,Sharon,"Off chart? What does that mean?
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"We don't even know.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"I told him not to go into the dream after his son. He should have waited for the experts to get here.
"
14,10,Sharon,"Who are the experts? 
"
14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,"Get that door closed! Keep me covered! 
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Ah good, you're here.
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"What's the sitch?!
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Four people, in there, all stuck in the middle one's dream.
"
14,10,Expert 1,"We need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them!
"
14,10,Sharon,"What next dream level?
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"Alright look. Right now they're all trapped in a dream.  We need to go in and put them under so they can go into a dream within a dream.
"
14,10,Sharon,"Why?
"
14,10,Expert 1,"Because in the dream within a dream we can protect them from getting to limbo.
"
14,10,Sharon,"What's that?
"
14,10,Expert 2,"Empty scary dreamspace.
"
14,10,Sharon,"So like a nightmare?
"
14,10,Expert 3,"No, like a nightmare within a nightmare!
"
14,10,Sharon,"Why can't you wake up from that?
"
14,10,Expert 1,"You can, but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare!
"
14,10,Sharon,"That doesn't sound very difficult.
"
14,10,Expert 1,"It is!
"
14,10,Sharon,"Why?
"
14,10,Expert 4,"Arrgh.
"
14,10,Expert 1,"We don't have time for this!
"
14,10,Sharon,"Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?
"
14,10,Expert 1,"Then we go into your husband's dream!
"
14,10,Sharon,"Okaaay...
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"But your husband will think we're in Hasselback's dream.
"
14,10,Sharon,"Okay, wait. Who's Hasselback?
"
14,10,Hasselback,"I am.
"
14,10,Sharon,"Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"Sometimes, thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains!
"
14,10,Sharon,"Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"Not all the time, just this once. And maybe one other time.
"
14,10,Expert 1,"It's so complex and cool.
"
14,10,Sharon,"Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"You just don't get it 'cause you're not smart enough. Let's move! 
"
14,10,Sharon,"Will they be able to wake Mackey up?
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"If they don't, it'll be the end of Europe as we know it.
"
14,10,Sharon,"Why?
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Because.
"
14,10,Ranger Pete,"Hello kids, my name is Ranger Pete.
"
14,10,Class,"Hi Ranger Pete.
"
14,10,Mackey,"Hi Ranger Pete, m'kay.
"
14,10,Ranger Pete,"Today we're gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem.
"
14,10,Mackey,"Oh that should be fun, m'kay.  Ahhhh...
"
14,10,Ranger Pete,"But first we have a very special guest. It's Woodsy Owl. 
"
14,10,Mackey,"Oh boy! Woodsy Owl!
"
14,10,Stan,"Who's that?
"
14,10,Mackey,"""Give a hoot, don't pollute,"" m'kay.
"
14,10,Woodsy Owl,"Hi, I'm Woodsy Owl, remindin' you all to please pick up your trash, and keep our forests clean. In the city or in the woods,
"
14,10,Mackey,"Help keep Americaaa lookin' good, m'kay.  Oh, boy I love that song.
"
14,10,Ranger Pete,"Alright kids, time to split up and go into the forest. Let's divide you all up into groups of six.
"
14,10,Billy,"We wanna be in Mackey's group!
"
14,10,Mackey,"Oh no, that that's m'kay. We'll uh we'll get paired with someone else uh.
"
14,10,Ranger Pete,"That's fine. You six boys can team up and be our first group in.
"
14,10,Mackey,"Oh no, oh God here it comes, unkay? 
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"Is this the dream, or the dream within the dream?
"
14,10,Expert 2,"I think it's the dream inside the Matrix inside the dream!
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"Oh well. Just keep shooting!
"
14,10,Stan,"What the fuck?
"
14,10,An Expert,"Mommy? Mommy?
"
14,10,Fire Captain,"So you're saying that all those people in there are somehow trapped in one person's dream?
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Yes, and so that's why I called the fire department. I don't know where else to turn.
"
14,10,Fireman 1,"Well, wait, if those people got stuck in there, why wouldn't we?
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"It's very simple: You see,  when the dream experts go in, they attempt to take the subject to a dream within a dream.
"
14,10,Fireman 1,"Like a taco within a taco?
"
14,10,Fire Captain,"A double-decker taco supreme.
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"Exactly. But only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels, and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other people's dreams.
"
14,10,Fire Captain,"Wait wait whoa whoa, how can you take a ladder into a dream? 
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"Because the firemen dreams aren't like dreams at all. They're more like a dream within a matrix within a dream.
"
14,10,Pizza Man,"Somebody order a pizza?
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"No.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Probably one of them in the dream.
"
14,10,Pizza Man,"Alright, I'm goin' in. 
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"Look, if we can get the fire department into the counselor's dream, then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels. That way we'll be in the counselor's deepest level of subconscious.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"And it will be like a taco, inside a taco, within a Taco Bell, that's inside a KFC, within a mall, that's INSIDE YOUR BRAIN! 
"
14,10,Mackey,"Aaaaaah! Not again, m'kay! Aaaaaah!
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, stop running!
"
14,10,Mackey,"But, but they're gonna kick my butt, m'kay!  They're gonna kick it bad!
"
14,10,Stan,"Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.
"
14,10,Mackey,"I know what about? I don't remember what they did. I just remember the field trip being really bad, okay.
"
14,10,Billy,"There he is! You can't run forever!
"
14,10,Mackey,"Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god... 
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
"
14,10,Mr. Yelman,"But I literally herd sheep.
"
14,10,Stan,"Shut up!
"
14,10,Mackey,"Okay. Okay, I can do this. I'm just gonna stand and, and face what happens, okay?
"
14,10,Pizza Man,"Somebody... order pizza? Pizza?
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"Mr. Mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Alright, that does it.  Get your coat.
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"Where are we going?
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"We need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world.
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"You don't mean...
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Hello, Freddy.  You're looking healthy.
"
14,10,Freddy Krueger,"Chinstrap! What happened? You run out of stoolies to do your work?
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Alright, look, we're in a pickle again and we need your help. Got some people trapped inside a dream.
"
14,10,Freddy Krueger,"Told you a long time ago: I gave that up. 
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"There's some good men stuck in there.
"
14,10,Freddy Krueger,"I said I'm done with it! 
"
14,10,Woman,"Everything all right, Fred?
"
14,10,Freddy Krueger,"It's fine, Peg. Get back in the house. 
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Wife and kids.
"
14,10,Freddy Krueger,"No thanks to you.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"We need ya Fred.
"
14,10,Freddy Krueger,"Like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the Russians?!
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"We had a country to protect!
"
14,10,Freddy Krueger,"Protect it yourselves this time.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Dammit I'm not working for the military anymore, Krueger!
"
14,10,Freddy Krueger,"Then you should have no problem covering it up. 
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Some of those trapped are firemen. Public servants, innocent in all of this.
"
14,10,Freddy Krueger,"Alright, fine.
"
14,10,Mackey,"Alright Billy, I'm not gonna let you hurt me this time, hm'kay? This time I'm gonna stand up for myself!
"
14,10,Billy,"You? Gonna fight back? I don't think so! 
"
14,10,Stan,"You can do it Mr. Mackey.
"
14,10,Mackey,"Go ahead and do your worst, Billy. I'm facing you head-on, m'kay?
"
14,10,Billy,"Alright Mackey. Take this. 
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"Get the perimeter secure! Make sure they're dead!
"
14,10,Stan,"What the hell?
"
14,10,Expert 2,"We got 'em! The bad memories are dead.
"
14,10,Fire Captain,"Alright everyone, this is the fire department. Do not panic.
"
14,10,Stan,"Who are you people?
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"We came here to rescue you from the bad guys in Mackey's dream.
"
14,10,Stan,"Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
"
14,10,Expert 1,"No. As long as the source of the drama is wiped out, the counselor can wake up.
"
14,10,Expert 2,"Right. 
"
14,10,Stan,"...Well then why aren't we waking up?
"
14,10,Expert 2,"Unless... the bullies aren't the source of the counselor's bad memory.
"
14,10,Mackey,"Hey that's right. The bullies didn't even beat me up that day. I, I ran away from them.
"
14,10,Expert 2,"Oh, whoops.
"
14,10,Mackey,"I remember.  I ran and I ran and I hid in this building here. And somebody was in there. Somebody who talked to me real nice and then... and then touched me somewhere bad. 
"
14,10,Real Mackey,"No Woodsy! Hmkay? Don't touch muh pee pee. No Woodsy, please. I'll give a hoot, hm'kay?
"
14,10,Mackey,"Woodsy Owl! No! I'll never litter again! I'll keep all my trash! No please Woodsy no! 
"
14,10,Fire Captain,"What's happening?
"
14,10,Expert 2,"Dream conundrum. This is bad. 
"
14,10,Fire Captain,"What the hell's going on?
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"The bad memory is manifesting itself! It didn't wanna be exposed!  Our dream bullets don't hurt it. 
"
14,10,Mackey,"No! No more, Woodsy. 
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
"
14,10,Expert 1,"He can't! Don't you get it?! We're all gonna go to limbo! 
"
14,10,Freddy Krueger,"There's a real hoot for ya, Woodsy! 
"
14,10,Mackey,"It's dead... It's finally dead. 
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Something's happening. I'm getting Bogart levels on all counter ups.
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"They're waking up. They're coming to. 
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Ahhh, you're back, everyone! 
"
14,10,Randy,"Aw, dammit. 
"
14,10,Fire Captain,"Thanks, Freddy.
"
14,10,Freddy Krueger,"If only I could have saved the sheep herder.
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Well, did you find the painful source of your hoarding problem, Mr. Mackey?
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"I sure did.
"
14,10,DiCaprio,"Turns out he was molested by Woodsy Owl.
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"I completely blocked it from my memory, hm'kay?
"
14,10,Fire Captain,"So, he was hoarding because when he tried to throw things away his subconscious would remember Woodsy's voice saying ""Give a hoot, don't pollute"" and touching his penis with his wing?
"
14,10,Pinkerton,"Wow, that is so complex and trippy and cool!
"
14,10,Dr. Chinstrap,"Well, now that we've uncovered Mackey's source of hoarding, we can finally move on to yours, Stan. Are you ready for your therapy?
"
14,10,Stan,"I think I have a better idea.
"
14,10,Wendy,"Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?
"
14,10,Stan,"Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
"
14,10,Kyle,"But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
"
14,10,Stan,"Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
"
14,10,Kyle,"How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 
"
14,11,Coon,"My fellow heroes, tonight I stopped three murders from happening.  I don't know why, but we're seeing a huge trend in crime. We have to find out the source of this evil. Something big is about to happen, and it is up to Coon and Friends to stop it.  Yes, Toolshed.
"
14,11,Toolshed,"Why do we have to be called ""Coon and Friends""?
"
14,11,Coon,"...What?
"
14,11,Toolshed,"We all fight crime together. How come we're just your ""friends""?
"
14,11,TupperWear,"Yeah. We wanna be called ""The Extreme Avenger League.""
"
14,11,All,"Yeah! That's right. Extreme Avenger League!
"
14,11,Coon,"I told you, TupperWear, Extreme Avenger League doesn't work.
"
14,11,TupperWear,"Why not?
"
14,11,Coon,"It's confusing! The Coon is a brand people already know.
"
14,11,Mosquito,"Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends?
"
14,11,Coon,"Nobody's fucking heard of you, Mosquito!
"
14,11,Mosquito,"Have, so.
"
14,11,Coon,"Look guys, we need to find out what's causing the crime wave in this city.  Mysterion, you and the Human Kite get on the computer and dig up what you can. TupperWear and Mosquito, scan the news. Toolshed, you run a perimeter check with Iron Maiden.
"
14,11,Iron Maiden,"Timmeh!
"
14,11,Coon,"Let's work, people!  Uh, Mint-Berry Crunch, could I have a quick word with you in the debriefing chamber?  Okay, ummm, I really enjoy having you be a part of Coon and Friends and I certainly appreciate your on-time paying of dues and fees; it's just... I don't... I'm not getting your deal. I mean, exactly what is Mint-Berry Crunch supposed to mean?  I, I get that you're half man and half berry, and that you're... crunchy with some mint, but... to be a part of Coon and Friends, you have to have a clear and more... superhero kind of identity.  Mint-Berry Crunch, ummm, I'm just wondering if... maybe you need to add something else to the Mint-Berry Crunch part of your costume.
"
14,11,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Like milk?
"
14,11,Coon,"No, not like milk! You see, I really think we're on different pages here, Mint-Berry Crunch! It's like you don't even- 
"
14,11,Alarm,"Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.
"
14,11,Coon,"Uh oh!  What's the alert, Mosquito?
"
14,11,Mosquito,"There's like a big fire or something in town.
"
14,11,Coon,"What? A fire? Coon volume up! 
"
14,11,News 4 Reporter,"There's thought to be at least twenty people trapped inside the apartment building, and firefighters are having no luck.
"
14,11,Coon,"My God, this is what we've been waiting for! Coon and Friends, let's head out!
"
14,11,Coon's Friends,"Let's do it! Yeah! Let's go! 
"
14,11,Coon,"Yeah, uhh, Mint-Berry Crunch, why don't you stay here and mind the place, okay? Kewl. 
"
14,11,Coon,"We've got to get downtown fast, Coon Friends!  Mom, you've gotta drive us downtown!
"
14,11,Liane,"Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?
"
14,11,Coon,"Mom, you're the Coon's faithful butler! I wanna go downtown now!
"
14,11,Liane,"Well, all right.  I guess I can get some groceries anyway. 
"
14,11,Coon,"Into the Coon Mobile, everyone! Let's just hope we get there in time! 
"
14,11,Liane,"All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?
"
14,11,Coon,"Mom, don't talk to us like that! We're fucking superheroes!
"
14,11,Liane,"Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!
"
14,11,Coon,"Oh... I'm sorry Mom, can we go please?  Unbelievable! 
"
14,11,Fireman,"We tried gettin' in through the back; it was no good!
"
14,11,Fire Captain,"Those people are gonna die if we don't do something!
"
14,11,Liane,"Oh my goodness, it's a fire. 
"
14,11,Coon,"Come on, Coon Friends!
"
14,11,Liane,"No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!
"
14,11,Fire Captain,"Can we try a helicopter?
"
14,11,Fireman,"The winds are too high. The chopper would burn in minutes. 
"
14,11,Coon,"All right, what seems to be the problem?
"
14,11,Fire Captain,"Get back, kids. It isn't safe.
"
14,11,Liane,"Eric, poopsie?
"
14,11,Coon,"Whatever's happening, you need help from the Coon!
"
14,11,Mosquito,"And friends!
"
14,11,Fire Captain,"Keep those children back, Thompson! 
"
14,11,Coon,"Please sir, you must let us-
"
14,11,Liane,"Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.
"
14,11,Coon,"Shut! Up! Mom! God!
"
14,11,Officer,"Wait. Look! Up in the sky!
"
14,11,Fireman,"It's him! My God, it's really him!
"
14,11,Fire Captain,"He's come to help us. Captain Hindsight! 
"
14,11,Stan,"Who's Captain Hindsight?
"
14,11,Announcer,"Captain Hindsight, the hero of the modern age.  Once known as Jack Brolin, a reporter for the national news, the hero was born when a freak accident gave him the amazing power of extraordinary hindsight. From toxic spills to unjust wars there is no task too large for... Captain Hindsight! 
"
14,11,Fire Captain,"Captain Hindsight, thank God you've come!
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"What's the skinny?
"
14,11,Fireman,"There's people trapped in that burning building, Captain Hindsight. And the fire is so massive we can't get to them.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it.
"
14,11,Fireman,"Yes, of course.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"And then you see that building to the left?
"
14,11,Fire Captain,"Yes.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to.  Well, looks like my job here is done. Goodbye everyone! 
"
14,11,Fireman,"Thank you, Captain Hindsight!
"
14,11,Officer,"Thank youuu!
"
14,11,Fire Captain,"All right everyone, I guess that's it. Let's pack it up. 
"
14,11,Randy,"Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?
"
14,11,Sharon,"Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.
"
14,11,Randy,"It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
"
14,11,Sharon,"Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.
"
14,11,Randy,"I mean, hello!
"
14,11,Stan,"Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
"
14,11,Randy,"Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. 
"
14,11,Alarm,"Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. 
"
14,11,Randy,"What the hell is that?  Who put that there?
"
14,11,Alarm: Alert.,"Seriously. All Coon Friends to base. Alert, you guys. I'm seriously.
"
14,11,Stan,"Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?
"
14,11,Sharon,"Well sure, Stan.  Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?
"
14,11,Randy,"I don't know.
"
14,11,Sharon,"Well take it down. It's noisy.
"
14,11,Randy,"I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. 
"
14,11,Coon,"Alright, Toolshed is here. We can start.
"
14,11,Toolshed,"Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?
"
14,11,Mosquito,"Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it.
"
14,11,Coon,"The Coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out.
"
14,11,TupperWear,"So what's the huge catastrophe?
"
14,11,Coon,"What's the huge-? Did you guys not see that Captain Hindsight guy?!
"
14,11,The Human Kite,"Yeah, so?
"
14,11,Coon,"So there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's NOT part of Coon and Friends!
"
14,11,Toolshed,"Oh Jesus...
"
14,11,Coon,"I've looked into it and this Captain Hindsight is everywhere. He's like some freelance butthole scab. We need to make him join us!
"
14,11,Professor Chaos,"Hey fellas?  Fellas, could you let me out please? It uh it's been like six days. 
"
14,11,Coon,"You aren't going anywhere, Chaos!
"
14,11,Professor Chaos,"Yeah, but uh, but uh youuu, but you only gave me this bucket to poop in and it's full now.  And I ain't got nothin' to eat.
"
14,11,Coon,"You've got poop, don'tcha?  Now the question is, how are we gonna get Captain Hindsight to join Coon and Friends?
"
14,11,Mysterion,"Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?
"
14,11,Coon,"I CARE!
"
14,11,Mysterion,"Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.
"
14,11,Coon,"There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?!
"
14,11,BP Man 1,"All right, this looks like a jolly good place.
"
14,11,BP Man 2,"Yes. Let's let her rip. 
"
14,11,BP Man 3,"That's it, lads. Collect that oil! 
"
14,11,BP Man 4,"Uh oh!  Oh deah.
"
14,11,BP Man 3,"Oh, don't tell me we did it again?
"
14,11,Alarm,"Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.  All Coon Friends report to base. I'm so seriously. Emergency. Coon and Friends alert. 
"
14,11,Coon,"Good, you're all here. Take a look at this. Coon volume up! 
"
14,11,Reporter,"It's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe. Oil from the ocean is spill out out of control, and the rescue effort seems futile.
"
14,11,Man,"It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.
"
14,11,Woman,"Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?
"
14,11,Cajun Shrimper,"Git a lookie on mah scrimp heuh! Might as give ya the best scrimp this side of Louisiana and now down tuh where we all got up in our scrimp, and it ain't worth a slimy noob it ain't sold on. There, now lookit all the url on mah scrimp!
"
14,11,Mysterion,"My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!
"
14,11,The Human Kite,"We've got to help those people!
"
14,11,Coon,"Yes. This is definitely a job for Coon and Friends.
"
14,11,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Let's pack the Gulf full of flavor! 
"
14,11,Rescuer 1,"Wait a minute. Look! It's Captain Hindsight! 
"
14,11,Coon,"Oh no!
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"What seems to be the problem?
"
14,11,Rescuer 2,"It's that BP Oil rig, Captain Hindsight. It drilled into a marine sanctuary and the environment is being poisoned.
"
14,11,Rescuer 3,"If we can't stop it, the spill could reach New Orleans.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling?
"
14,11,Rescuer 3,"Yes.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill!
"
14,11,Rescuer 2,"Aha!
"
14,11,Rescuer 4,"Yesss, YESSS.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke.
"
14,11,Rescuer 2,"I believe they did install a backup safety valve, Captain Hindsight.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve!
"
14,11,Rescuer 5,"My God, he's right!
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need!
"
14,11,Rescuer 4,"God bless you, Captain Hindsight! God bless you!!
"
14,11,Coon,"Goddammit! We have got to get that guy into Coon and Friends!
"
14,11,Butler,"Can I help you?
"
14,11,Cartman,"I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
"
14,11,Butler,"Yes?
"
14,11,Cartman,"I need to speak with him, please.
"
14,11,Butler,"The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.
"
14,11,Cartman,"I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
"
14,11,Butler,"Mr. Hindsight, sir.  This young man would like a word.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Please, sit down. What can I do for you?
"
14,11,Cartman,"Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Of what?
"
14,11,Cartman,"I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
"
14,11,Officer 2,"Captain Hindsight? Captain Hindsight, please come in! 
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Go ahead.
"
14,11,Officer 2,"The oil keeps coming out! We've got other rigs now catching fire!
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened.
"
14,11,Officer 2,"Right.  Thank you! 
"
14,11,Fireman 2,"Captain Hindsight! The dolphins that those volunteers cleaned of oil, they, they're all dying!
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner!
"
14,11,Commissioner,"Yes?
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong!  It's not a blessing, it's a curse.
"
14,11,Cartman,"...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone.
"
14,11,Cartman,"Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Get this kid out of here! I have to think!
"
14,11,Cartman,"Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! 
"
14,11,Anchor Man,"The BP Oil spill in the Gulf continues to get worse every day. As public anger towards the BP Company grows, their president released this statement:
"
14,11,Tony Hayward,"Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, president and CEO of BP. Our accidental drilling spill again in the Gulf us a tragedy that should have never happened. And to all those affected, I want to say, we are deeply sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Sorry.  BP has taken full responsibility for cleaning up this spill in the Gulf, and in doing so, we've changed our name from Beyond Petroleum, to Dependable Petroleum.  We no longer fuck the earth, we DP it.
"
14,11,Coon,"Gentlemen, my attempts to recruit Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends have been unsuccessful, but I believe I've come up with a solution. Coon Vision on!  All we need to do is get pictures of Captain Hindsight naked with Courtney Love. Then we'll tell him if he doesn't join us, we'll put them on the Internet.
"
14,11,Toolshed,"How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?
"
14,11,Coon,"Simple, Toolshed. Coon slide 2?  We dress Professor Chaos up as Courtney Love, take pictures of him naked with a homeless guy, then photoshop Hindsight's face onto it.
"
14,11,Professor Chaos,"Me?? Awww, come on, fellas, don't make me be Courtney Love.
"
14,11,Coon,"Gotta get to work fast, people! Coon and Friends, ho!
"
14,11,Mosquito,"...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like.
"
14,11,Coon,"That's because you think small, Mosquito! You have a tiny little mosquito brain, that's why you don't come up with the plan!
"
14,11,Mosquito,"Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero.
"
14,11,Mysterion,"Agreed.
"
14,11,Coon,"Oh who cares about some oil spill environment crap?!
"
14,11,Toolshed,"Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!
"
14,11,Coon,"You don't know that I'm Cartman because my true identity is secret!
"
14,11,Mysterion,"We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!
"
14,11,Coon,"All right, Mosquito, how do you wanna help people suffering in the Gulf crisis? 
"
14,11,Mosquito,"I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale.
"
14,11,Coon,"A bake sale?
"
14,11,Mosquito,"I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people.
"
14,11,Coon,"We're superheroes, not the fucking Girl Scouts!
"
14,11,Mysterion,"Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.
"
14,11,Iron Maiden,"Timmeh!
"
14,11,Coon,"You think selling lemon bars is helpful to mankind?
"
14,11,Mint-Berry Crunch,"More helpful than taking naked pictures of Butters.
"
14,11,Coon,"Shut up, Mint-Berry Crunch! You aren't even anything!
"
14,11,Mosquito,"And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch!
"
14,11,Coon,"Oh, what are you, the boss now?!
"
14,11,Mosquito,"No, but we are all equal! From now on, we vote! Who wants to go with my plan? 
"
14,11,Coon,"Sounds awesome. Let's do it.
"
14,11,Toolshed,"To the grocery store!
"
14,11,Coon,"As we walked along the road to the grocery store, my Coon sense started tingling. Something was wrong. Very wrong. I've learned to trust my Coon sense. It has always been my guide. And so I knew I must act. A coon must know when to defend itself. 
"
14,11,Coon,"Well, now we're back to normal.  Just like before and all forgotten? Right right?
"
14,11,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Right right.
"
14,11,Mosquito,"Right.
"
14,11,Coon,"Keewwwl! So what's next for Coon and Friends? 
"
14,11,Anchor Man,"Another crisis in the Gulf of Mexico as the oil company DP has once again made a huge error.  This time, the oil company has accidentally ripped a hole into another dimension.  The oil company stated that it knew a portal to another dimension was there, but didn't think drilling into it would prove problematic.  Now hundreds of creatures from another dimension are spilling out into our reality and wreaking havoc. 
"
14,11,Tony Hayward,"Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, CEO of DP. Tearing a hole into another dimension is a tragedy that should have never happened. And as CEO, I would like to say... We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Sohr-ry.
"
14,11,Butler,"Captain Hindsight! Sir! Calls for help are pouring in! You've got to get out to the Gulf!
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"I can't help anyone right now! Something came up.
"
14,11,Butler,"What, sir? You know you can tell me.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk?
"
14,11,Butler,"Yes sir.
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"Look at those photos on the desk. 
"
14,11,Butler,"My God, is that you and... Courtney Love?
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"'Course it's Courtney Love!
"
14,11,Butler,"But when did you have a-
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening!
"
14,11,Butler,"That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done!
"
14,11,Captain Hindsight,"I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-
"
14,11,Butler,"Sir! SIR!
"
14,11,Reporter,"Creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the Gulf, and the question everyone is asking is, ""Where is Captain Hindsight?""
"
14,11,Rescuer 6,"Where are you, Captain Hindsight?
"
14,11,Cajun Shrimper,"Where are d'you countih ninety-oh bebbly now is showmesitchcum.
"
14,11,Reporter,"With Captain Hindsight missing, what superheroes can save the Gulf now?
"
14,11,Coon,"My fellow superheroes, I have done it. Hindsight is taken care of. And now the country can finally be made aware of Coon and Friends!
"
14,11,Toolshed,"There's more important things to discuss right now!
"
14,11,Coon,"Right, Toolshed. Now, how do we deal with these creatures from another dimension?
"
14,11,Mysterion,"He means we need to discuss things with you!
"
14,11,Coon,"Okay, what?
"
14,11,Mysterion,"Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!
"
14,11,TupperWear,"I don't wanna tell him either.
"
14,11,The Human Kite,"I'll tell him. Coon, I'm sorry, but we're kicking you out of Coon and Friends.
"
14,11,Coon,"You're kicking me out of Coon and Friends.
"
14,11,Toolshed,"We all voted, it was unanimous.
"
14,11,Coon,"You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon!
"
14,11,The Human Kite,"Look, we just believe that you have your goals and ways of doing things and they conflict with what we want to accomplish.
"
14,11,Mysterion,"But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.
"
14,11,Coon,"You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys!
"
14,11,Mysterion,"We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? 
"
14,11,Liane,"Yes, Mysterion?
"
14,11,Mysterion,"Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.
"
14,11,Liane,"Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?
"
14,11,Coon,"Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!
"
14,11,Liane,"Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!
"
14,11,Coon,"You've gotta be fucking kidding me!
"
14,11,DP Executive 1,"Oh dear, we have certainly pooped our trousers this time!
"
14,11,Tony Hayward,"Yes, I'm afraid it's going to take more than another ""I'm sorry"" campaign to please everyone this time.
"
14,11,DP Executive 2,"Oh, what a right pickle we're in. 
"
14,11,DP Executive 3,"There is no way to cut the dimensional portal, I'm afraid. The ocean currents and swells are simply too much to get any machines in.
"
14,11,Tony Hayward,"Wait a tick!  Currents and swells, that's it! I think I know how to fix this!
"
14,11,DP Executive 4,"How, by Jove?
"
14,11,Tony Hayward,"We drill.
"
14,11,DP Executives,"Drill of course, yes, yes, of course.
"
14,11,Tony Hayward,"I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill.
"
14,11,DP Executive 5,"I don't quite get it.
"
14,11,Tony Hayward,"We got into this mess by drilling heuh , and heuh . Now, we need to drill heuh! 
"
14,11,DP Executive 6,"That looks extremely promising!
"
14,11,Tony Hayward,"Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time.
"
14,11,DP Executive 6,"The seismic forces will be massive. Do you think the moon can take it?
"
14,11,Tony Hayward,"Oh, she'll take it.
"
14,11,Anchor Man,"The DP Oil Company today drilled into the moon and appears to have caused even greater problems.
"
14,11,Stan,"Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.
"
14,11,Reporter,"Tom, the DP Oil Company has had another drilling accident.  This time they appear to have unleashed the dark and mighty Cthulhu.  The rise of Cthulhu from another dimension brings about three thousand years of darkness, Tom, where we will all be driven to madness and made to service Cthulhu's cult as slaves. The president of DP Oil released this press statement:
"
14,11,Tony Hayward,"As president of DP Oil, I want to say... We're sorry.  I'm deeply sorry.  Sorry.
"
14,11,Reporter,"Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. Praise the dark Cthulhu, long may he reign.
"
14,11,Stan,"It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 
"
14,11,Cartman,"Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
"
14,11,Cartman,"Asshoooles! 
"
14,12,Mysterion,"I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school.  For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone.  The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized.
"
14,12,Tony Hayward,"We're sorry.
"
14,12,Mysterion,"But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.
"
14,12,Tony Hayward,"We're sorry. 
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.
"
14,12,Tony Hayward,"Sorry. 
"
14,12,Mysterion,"I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! 
"
14,12,Woman 1,"Just terrific what you boys are doing.
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Thank you, ma'am.
"
14,12,Man 1,"I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals.
"
14,12,Field Reporter,"A terrific human interest story here, Tom. As America wonders what happened to Captain Hindsight, some Colorado kids are being a little ""superhuman"" themselves. They call themselves ""Coon and Friends,"" and they've been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the Gulf crisis.
"
14,12,Mysterion,"We believe that every little bit helps.
"
14,12,Field Reporter,"Their little ""super club"" consists of seven young heroes. 
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Toolshed!
"
14,12,Human Kite,"The Human Kite!
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Mysterion!
"
14,12,TupperWear,"TupperWear!
"
14,12,Mosquito,"Mosquito!
"
14,12,Iron Maiden,"Timmah!
"
14,12,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mint Berry Crrrunch! 
"
14,12,Field Reporter,"The boys stated that there used to also be a hero named The Coon actually in the group, but they let him go because he was being quote,  ""a dick"".
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that  extremely funny.
"
14,12,Clerk,"Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour.
"
14,12,Passengers,"Awwww!
"
14,12,Coon,"Come on, people! Some of us need to get to New Orleans NOW!  Yes yes, I am the Coon.
"
14,12,Blonde Girl,"The Coon? I've heard of that.
"
14,12,Coon,"Ya have?
"
14,12,Blonde Girl,"I saw on TV. That superhero group that's helping with the Gulf spill. Coon and Friends.
"
14,12,Coon,"Actually, I'm no longer with Coon and Friends. I work on my own now.
"
14,12,Blonde Girl,"Can I ask you a question?
"
14,12,Coon,"Yes, of course.
"
14,12,Blonde Girl,"Do you know Mint-Berry Crunch? What's he like? 
"
14,12,Coon,"The evil girl villain fought with all her might, but the Coon was too much for her. As people looked on and cheered for the Coon, he clawed and punched the villain's stupid fat face!  This fight would not be the last the Coon fought. Next stop: New Orleans!
"
14,12,Mosquito,"That's almost it, superheroes. We're about out of lemon bars.
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more!
"
14,12,Iron Maiden,"Timmah! 
"
14,12,Man 2,"I'll take ten lemon bars.
"
14,12,Mosquito,"Ten. Yes sir! 
"
14,12,Human Kite,"That's definitely the last of them.
"
14,12,Man 2,"You'll never stop him, you know. 
"
14,12,Mosquito,"Stop who?
"
14,12,Man 2,"The Great One.  Cthulhu. He has risen, and soon all will be under his rule. It has all been foretold in the Necronomicon.  Hail Cthulhu! The darkness of the mythos is finally here.  Oh man, these are really good lemon bars. 
"
14,12,Toolshed,"The Necronomicon?
"
14,12,TupperWear,"What's a mythos?
"
14,12,Mysterion,"I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.
"
14,12,Toolshed,"All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!
"
14,12,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mint-Berry Crrunch!
"
14,12,TupperWear,"What the hell?!
"
14,12,Mosquito,"I knew it! Cartman tore our base up!
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Not Cartman.
"
14,12,Human Kite,"What do you mean ""Not Cartman,"" dude?
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"Don't anybody move!  So you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me!
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight.
"
14,12,Narrator,"Captain Hindsight,  the hero of the modern age. Once a reporter for the National News, Jack Brolin always had a knack for hindsight.  Wanting to become the best-known reporter in the country, Jack tried an experiment to boost his hindsight levels. But then a freakish accident occurred when a retroactive spider got into the equipment. The reporter's hindsight was blasted to superhuman levels!  For months he was able to use his new powers for good, fighting for peace, and the American way.  With his three trusty companions, Shoulda, Coulda, and Woulda.  But now, the Hindsight that has saved so many threatens to consume Jack's very soul. It's Captaiiin Hindsight!
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Um dude, are you okay?
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"Where are the pictures?! Give every copy of the pictures to me NOW!
"
14,12,Mint-Berry Crunch,"P-p-please sir, w-we don't know what you mean.
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"You got pictures of me having sex with Courtney Love!
"
14,12,Professor Chaos,"Uhhh ohhh...
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Chaos! Why did you take those pictures?!
"
14,12,Professor Chaos,"But uh, but, but the Coon said if I took the pictures he, he'd let me go home and, and I've missed four days of school now 'cause I've been-
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"Alright enough! What's going on?!
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"It's not Courtney Love?
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Please sir, put down the gun.
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?!
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all!
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Then do it!  Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy!
"
14,12,Human Kite,"Dude, Kenny, ch-chill out.
"
14,12,Mysterion,"You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!
"
14,12,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Wuh uh okay, if you insist. Uh see ya, Kenny.
"
14,12,Human Kite,"My mom did tell me I had to be home by five, I-
"
14,12,Mysterion,"I said it's fine! Just go! 
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'. 
"
14,12,Coon,"Cthulhu! Cthulhu, dude! Over here!  Hey Cthulhu. 'Sup? Yes, it is me, the Coon! But don't worry, I'm actually not here to fight you! We are not so different, Cthulhu. Though I am a superhero and you are a dark god from another dimension, perhaps, we can work together!  I know how it feels to want to take over and rule the earth and have everyone else be your slaves. I do, bro! But there's a group of superhumans who are going to stop at nothing to stop YOU!  Good, I have your attention. The superhumans I speak of are right now working on plans to destroy you! They reside in Colorado and they are fucking assholes, and they all deserve to be sent into a dark oblivion! You can do that, right? Send people into a dark oblivion? 'Cause that's what those buttholes deserve!  No-Dude! Dude, Colorado is that way! Where are you going??  Goddammit, why don't dark lords fuckin' listen?!
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"It doesn't matter.  Even if the pictures are fake. I can't take it anymore.  Do you have any idea what a curse it is to have perfect 20/20 hindsight?  As soon as something bad happens, I immediately know how it could have been avoided. I can't take it anymore!
"
14,12,Mysterion,"People need you, Hindsight!  Without you they feel helpless and stupid.
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?!
"
14,12,Mysterion,"You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker!  Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"Wha-? What is your power?
"
14,12,Mysterion,"I can't die.  I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes.  And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, ""Oh hey Kenny."" Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes.  You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.
"
14,12,Announcer,"And now, a special announcement from the president of BP and DP.
"
14,12,Tony Hayward,"Hello, I'm Tony Hayward. The tragic spill in the Gulf is a disaster that should have never happened. And as head of the oil company responsible, I would like to say, what should I do?  Should I admit we've made mistakes?  Should I remind you we've done this before? What should I do? Should I find newer and better ways to say I'm sorry? 
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"Should I really believe I ruined my legacy?  What should I do?
"
14,12,Tony Hayward,"What should I do?
"
14,12,Mysterion,"What should I do?  Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?
"
14,12,Tony Hayward,"Or should I tell you, ""I am not a role model."" 
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"Seriously, what should I do?
"
14,12,Tony Hayward,"Should I accept my role as the villain?
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Maybe I should just... disappear.
"
14,12,Tony Hayward,"Should I not have listened to my technicians who said a spill wouldn't happen? They're my technicians! 
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"Hindsight's a bitch, isn't it?
"
14,12,Coon,"Should I just apologize to my friends and ask them to take me back? Tell then that I was being a selfish jerk?  What should I do?
"
14,12,Captain Hindsight,"Should I get back in the chair? Remove my powers and just go back to being a simple reporter? 
"
14,12,Coon,"Should I admit I was wrong? Ask for everyone's forgiveness and go back to my original team?  Nah, screw that. I'm just gonna keep bein' a fuckin' dick! 
"
14,12,Toolshed,"All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing!
"
14,12,Mosquito,"Right, Toolshed!
"
14,12,Human Kite,"Here we go: ""The Necronomicon contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them.""
"
14,12,Toolshed,"""It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu.""
"
14,12,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Aha! That's the cult the creepy man talked about, heroes. Uh, you okay, Mysterion?
"
14,12,Mysterion,"I'm fine.
"
14,12,Human Kite,"Ten arrested in South Park for cultish activity. This is from like, ten years ago.
"
14,12,Mysterion,"So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.
"
14,12,Human Kite,"Hey wait a minute. Dude. Mysterion, it's your parents.
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Uhh, what?  What the fuck?! I m-I mean,  Uh, I mean, what the fuck?! 
"
14,12,Betsy,"Clyde? Clyde, I told you this morning to take the garbage out.  Clyde, do you hear me?
"
14,12,Mosquito,"Okay Mom, just give me two minutes.  Nag nag nag. 
"
14,12,Coon,"Convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task. After days of killing and conquering, Cthulhu is at rest. Now is my chance to make a move. Perhaps last time I was too forceful with the dark god. Too demanding. To get what it wants, sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious.  But sometimes a coon must be cuddly and cute.  Time for me to try and manipulate the most evil thing in all the universe.  Who's the sleepy little man?  My name is the Little Coon. What is your name?  Craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  You're a sleepy man ne, Cthulhu?  Who's a needs a tummy rub? 
"
14,12,Mrs. McCormick,"You're hoggin' it all, asshole! 
"
14,12,Stuart,"'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!
"
14,12,Mrs. McCormick,"You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!
"
14,12,Stuart,"I told you to shut up!
"
14,12,Mrs. McCormick,"Give to me, you prick!  AH! AAAAH!  Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again!
"
14,12,Stuart,"Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.
"
14,12,Mrs. McCormick,"And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night. 
"
14,12,Mysterion,"I'm not here about that.
"
14,12,Stuart,"Oh. Uhuh, sss-so now what?
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.
"
14,12,Mrs. McCormick,"We were?
"
14,12,Stuart,"We've been arrested lots of times, Mysterio.
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Mysterion. What is the Cult of Cthulhu?! 
"
14,12,Stuart,"Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.
"
14,12,Mysterion,"What happened at those meetings?
"
14,12,Stuart,"Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.
"
14,12,Mysterion,"I don't find that hard to believe at all.
"
14,12,Mrs. McCormick,"I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited.
"
14,12,Mysterion,"These people still meet? Where?
"
14,12,Stuart,"Where they always did. Jim McElroy's house.
"
14,12,Mrs. McCormick,"They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do.  Did that really just happen?
"
14,12,Stuart,"I don't think so. 
"
14,12,Field Reporter,"Breaking news here in the Gulf, Tom. The dark ancient god Cthulhu has called for a press conference, The Old One told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news.
"
14,12,Coon,"Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of Cthulhu, and the Coon. Cthulhu's track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question. And now, coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of The Coon, we intend to bring change and fight injustice. As the all-new Coon and Friends. And anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law! Oh, what's that? There is another group using our trademarked name? Well, I guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion, don't we?!
"
14,12,Followers,"ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
"
14,12,Cult Leader,"The Old One has awakened!  A lot of us have waited a long time for this day. Well for all our South Park Cthulhu members old and new, it is time to par-tay! 
"
14,12,Mysterion,"There must be clubs like this all over the world.
"
14,12,Toolshed,"We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys.
"
14,12,Human Kite,"Oh my God, look! Back row. Aren't those the Goth kids?
"
14,12,Red Goth,"I'm so freaking stoked that Cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists.
"
14,12,Tall Goth,"Yeah. I just hope he puts an end to the fucking Disney Channel.
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?
"
14,12,Mysterion,"Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.
"
14,12,Cult Leader,"Now let us read from the Necronomicon. ""That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons""
"
14,12,Followers,"""Even Death may die."" 
"
14,12,Toolshed,"""In strange aeons even Death may die?"" What does that mean, Human Kite?
"
14,12,Human Kite,"I'm not sure, Toolshed. Could it be a riddle, Mysterion? M-! Mysterion? 
"
14,12,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mysterion is sooo... mysterious.
"
14,12,Jack Brolin,"A horrific scene of destruction, despair and terror here in New Orleans. And still there's no sign of Captain Hindsight. Rumor has it he got sick of it all, went back to his chair, and removed all his powers.
"
14,12,Injured Man,"Where are you Captain Hindsight? Aggh!
"
14,12,Jack Brolin,"Perhaps... he shouldn't have gotten back in that chair...
"
14,12,Red Goth,"Do you think the dark lord Cthulhu is gonna make us go to school?
"
14,12,Tall Goth,"No, assmunch. Cthulhu just wants chaos, bedlam, and madness.
"
14,12,Red Goth,"Good, because if I have to go to PE class again, I was gonna kill myself.  Who the F'n H is that?
"
14,12,Mysterion,"What does it mean? ""That is not dead which can eternal lie""?
"
14,12,Tall Goth,"""And with strange aeons even Death may die.""
"
14,12,Mysterion,"What does it mean?!
"
14,12,Red Goth,"It means Cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff. It's gonna be like, a Nine Inch Nails concert that goes on forever.
"
14,12,Tall Goth,"Yeah, so go home and put your underwear back inside your pants, poser.
"
14,12,Mysterion,"You're going to tell me everything you know!
"
14,12,Kindergoth,"Nobody's stopping Cthulhu now! All will be sadness. Life will become death, and I will watch the crimson blood leak from your neck.
"
14,12,Tall Goth,"Dude, that little kid is hardcore goth.
"
14,12,Red Goth,"Hardcore goth.
"
14,12,Cult Leader,"The child is right, you know. Cthulhu sees all, hears all. The dark lord wants us to dispense of this one, kids. Give us a hand.
"
14,12,Red Goth,"Whaaat? Dude, I don't wanna kill anybody.
"
14,12,Tall Goth,"We're dark lord minions now, wuss. What'd you think we'd be doing?
"
14,12,Red Goth,"Ugh, whatevs. 
"
14,12,Singer,"Cthulhu Cthulhu, Cthulhu Cthulhu.
"
14,12,Coon,"Yeeheah!
"
14,12,Singer,"The evil hate-filled Cthulhu, from a dimension far away.Flying through gates of madness and into your heart
"
14,12,Coon,"Yeah, fuck all o'you!
"
14,12,Singer,"Turning dreams into nightmares
"
14,12,Coon,"Lick my balls!
"
14,12,Singer,"Destroying all he sees
"
14,12,Coon,"Now begins a new adventure for... MEEEE!
"
14,12,Singer,"You and the dark one, Cthulhu
Sharing adventures and smiles,
It's a magical bond two pals can share.
Soon the whole world will be made aware of
You and the death lord, Cthulhu
Makin' the world a better place.
Together you will have so much fun
"
14,12,Coon,"Sending all my stupid friends to oblivion!
"
14,12,Singer,"You and the dark one, Cthulhu
"
14,12,Coon,"Suck it, bitches!
"
14,12,Cult Leader,"Just hold still and it will all be over quickly. 
"
14,12,Mosquito,"Let him go!  Coon and Friends, ho! Mosquito!
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Toolshed!
"
14,12,TupperWear,"TupperWear!
"
14,12,Iron Maiden,"Timmeh!
"
14,12,Human Kite,"Human Kite!
"
14,12,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mint-Berry Crrrunch!
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you!
"
14,12,Cult Leader,"Sorry kids. It's a little late for that. 
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!
"
14,12,Human Kite,"You bastards! 
"
14,12,Toolshed,"Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!
"
14,12,Mosquito,"Yeah, come on, get your costume on, lazy-ass!
"
14,12,Human Kite,"Let's go. 
"
14,12,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mint-Berry Crunch! 
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Sit back, justice believers, and listen to another edition of America's favorite superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch!  Our story begins in a remote corner of the Gulf of Mexico.  The BP Oil Company drills into the ocean floor,  but they drill too much, and the BP Oil Company accidentally unleashes Cthulhu, an ancient evil god from another dimension. Halfway across the country,  a mild-mannered attractive fourth-grader, Bradley Biggle, hears of the disaster on the news while with his friends.  But Bradley Biggle is no ordinary fourth-grader! Not long ago, he realized he had superpowers he could call upon by turning in place and saying the magic word, ""Shablagoo!"" And in a flash, Bradley is transformed into the thrilling superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch! Joined by the other Coon Friends, Mint-Berry Crunch went to investigate the Gulf spill crisis! The superheroes came across a cult, in existence for years, that had been waiting for Cthulhu's arrival. They are the key to stopping Cthulhu from taking over the world! Sometimes, when everything seems hopeless, that's when you need to bring it all.  That's when you need... to bring the Crr-runch!
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Rrright!
"
14,13,Human Kite,"But then what exactly is your superpower?
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"The power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch!
"
14,13,Toolshed,"...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-
"
14,13,Human Kite,"And shoot lasers out of my eyes.
"
14,13,Toolshed,"And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can...  Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?
"
14,13,Mysterion,"I can't die!
"
14,13,Toolshed,"...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-
"
14,13,Mysterion,"No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!
"
14,13,Toolshed,"...Woo-hat?
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed ""Oh my God,"" and you called him a bastard!
"
14,13,Human Kite,"When was that?
"
14,13,Mysterion,"All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!
"
14,13,Toolshed,"...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Dude, you're freaking out Mint-Berry Crunch. He's peed his pants. 
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Nono. Mint-Berry Crunch doesn't ever pee his pants!
"
14,13,Mysterion,"I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.
"
14,13,Human Kite,"Alright. dude, let, let's just say you're not crazy and it's true. What's the big deal? I mean, I think it'd be pretty cool not to be able to die.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Kenny Kenny, calm down.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me!  Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember! 
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!
"
14,13,Human Kite,"Dude!
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Is he? Oh Jesus! 
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Kenny? No! No!
"
14,13,Coon,"Gather around, believers in good, and listen to the newest installment of The Coon. It all began when the BP Oil Company drilled into the ocean floor and ripped open a hole into another dimension. Seeing the disaster on Coon-Vision, the Coon immediately called together his trusty Coon Friends. As the Coon explained how the disaster could be stopped, something terrible happened. Without warning, the Coon friends changed. Their superpowers morphed somehow, turning them into... supervillains.  The Coon tried to reason with them, tried to bring them back to the side of good,  but it was too late.  Their black hearts had been tainted by hate and rage. The Coon was alone, turn by the ultimate dilemma.  He had to put a stop to the evil villains, even though they had once been his friends. Sometimes, to fight the ultimate evil, you must make friends with enemies.  The Coon teamed up with Cthulhu, because even Cthulhu knows what evil assholes Kyle and Stan and those guys are! And that they are manipulative, uncaring, vagina faces! They're all planning to destroy the world. Only one thing can stop them: the Coon. With Cthulhu's help, I can try to banish them to a dark oblivion, for all eternity.  I will not rest until that happens.
"
14,13,Coon,"Bab-ay,
I know you're askin' me to stay
Say ""Please please please don't go away.""
You say I'm givin' you the blues.
Mayb-ay,
you mean every word you say
Can't help but think-
"
14,13,Liane,"Eric Cartman!
"
14,13,Coon,"Hi Mom.
"
14,13,Liane,"Where have you been, young man?!
"
14,13,Coon,"Just doin' stuff Mom. Are my friends downstairs in the secret base?
"
14,13,Liane,"Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!
"
14,13,Coon,"The Coon's mother appears to be extremely upset. In order to get past her, I must use the LeBron James technique.
"
14,13,Liane,"Eric, are you listening to me?!
"
14,13,Coon,"Mom... what should I do?
"
14,13,Liane,"What?
"
14,13,Coon,"What should I do? Should I admit I made mistakes? Should I say I've done this before? Should I write a song about how I should have stayed in my room? What should I do?
"
14,13,Liane,"What do you mean ""what should-""
"
14,13,Coon,"Should I say I am not a role model? Should I not listen to my conscience? It's my conscience, Mom! What should I do? Go back to my room and pretend nothing happened? Not jump out the window and fly to New Orleans? What should I do, Ma? Tell me!
"
14,13,Liane,"I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. 
"
14,13,Human Kite,"Alright Coon and Friends, what good deed should we do next?
"
14,13,Mosquito,"Perhaps we should make more lemon bars to raise money for people in need.
"
14,13,TupperWear,"Okay!
"
14,13,Mysterion,"You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you?
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Uh-what?
"
14,13,Mysterion,"What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.
"
14,13,Human Kite,"Yeah cool let's talk about where our powers come from.
"
14,13,Mosquito,"I was bitten by a radioactive mosquito! Bzzzzzzt.
"
14,13,TupperWear,"I was in a car accident, then put back together with Tupperware parts.
"
14,13,Iron Maiden,"Tih-Timmieh!
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!
"
14,13,Coon,"Hey guys.  So, what's goin' on?
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?
"
14,13,Coon,"No, I, I know. That's cool, I understand. Even though I started it and the secret base is in my house. Yes, that's totally understandable.
"
14,13,Human Kite,"You just wanted to frame and blackmail people, then you beat up Clyde and Bradley for no reason!
"
14,13,Coon,"No you're right. For no reason. Clearly something is wrong with me. But you guys, what should I do?
"
14,13,Human Kite,"You should fuck off, that's what you should do.
"
14,13,Coon,"Hm. Ah, all right, look. You guys were totally right, okay? That's all I wanted to say. That and... there's a double rainbow outside.
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"A what?
"
14,13,Coon,"Double rainbow, you guys. You don't see 'em often, but there's one outside right now. You've gotta come see! 
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"A double rainbow? Shablagoo! 
"
14,13,Human Kite,"Wait, Mint-Berry Crunch ya you might not wanna go- 
"
14,13,Professor Chaos,"Huhey, can I see the double rainbow, fellas?  Uh, fellas?
"
14,13,Coon,"Isn't it beautiful you guys?
"
14,13,Human Kite,"There's no double rainbow, fatass!
"
14,13,Coon,"You are correct, Human Kike! Not that supervillains like you guys could ever see a double rainbow!
"
14,13,Mosquito,"What are you talking about?
"
14,13,Coon,"Your evil-doing days are over, Mosquito! All of you shall now be dealt the swift hand of justice!
"
14,13,Human Kite,"Cartman, you are the bad guy, not us!
"
14,13,Coon,"Nuh uh, you guys are the bad guy. 
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Waaaaaaaaaah! 
"
14,13,Mysterion,"What are you doing with that thing?!
"
14,13,Coon,"He's going to help me get rid of you guys so together we can make the world a better place!
"
14,13,Human Kite,"Cartman, if you team up with the most evil thing in the universe, then clearly you are the bad guy!
"
14,13,Coon,"No, because it's for the greater good, like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor!
"
14,13,Human Kite,"Superman never teamed up with Lex Luthor!
"
14,13,Coon,"Well, that's why Superman isn't around anymore, isn't it? Cthulhu! Banish them to a dark oblivion, please!  Aww! Dude, that was awesome! You're all like ""Mehhhh"" and they were all like ""Nooo!""
"
14,13,Coon,"All right, now, we've taken out most of the synagogues, destroyed San Francisco, sent my friends into a dark oblivion, and so our next order of business will be Burning Man.  Burning Man is the biggest hippie festival in the world, and tomorrow, we're gonna wipe them all out. Pretty soon, the whole wold will be transformed thanks to the Coon!  Yes yes, the Coon and Friend. Now after Burning Man we'll take down Whole Foods alright?  The dark lord is agitated and the LeBron James technique might not work. The Coon will have to use an even more manipulative technique. Time to bust out: Cute Kitten.  Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.  Meow meow meow. 
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Dude, where the fuck are we?
"
14,13,Mysterion,"I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before. 
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"And so, the Coon had returned with the dark lord Cthulhu! Upon seeing Cthulhu in person, Mint-Berry Crunch heroically dashed off, to, to save the day! With Minty coolness he hurried back home! And heroically watched Judge Judy, knowing that his superhero friends were probably just fine without him!
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Oh shit!
"
14,13,Human Kite,"We aren't going that way!
"
14,13,Mosquito,"You guys, I wanna go home.
"
14,13,Toolshed,"We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here.
"
14,13,Mosquito,"Look, maybe we should just a place to hid and wait for help.
"
14,13,Human Kite,"What help, dude? Nobody in the real world even knows we're here.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. 
"
14,13,Toolshed,"How, dude?
"
14,13,Human Kite,"Kenny, where the hell are you going?
"
14,13,Mysterion,"I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. 
"
14,13,Mosquito,"Kenny! 
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Ow! That fucking HURTS! 
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Oh my God! Kenny!
"
14,13,Human Kite,"You... you crazy bastard! 
"
14,13,Man 1,"It's burning Man!
"
14,13,Man 2,"Biggest party in the world, baby! 
"
14,13,Coon,"Fucking hippies! Fuck all o'you! 
"
14,13,Reporter,"The dark and evil Cthulhu is bringing his angry wrath down upon the Burning Man Festival, Tom. Cthulhu isn't behaving as most scientists had speculated, Tom, but the dark lord is wreaking havoc everywhere and-
"
14,13,Coon,"No nonono! Excuse me! It is not Cthulhu, it is Coon and Friend! I'm a little sick of everyone giving him all the credit when I'm the one really making the world a better place!
"
14,13,Reporter,"Tom, it appears that Bruce Vilanch has arrived on the scene wearing a rat costume.
"
14,13,Coon,"Oh, you motherfucker!  Cthulhu, this guy too!  Kewl. Oh get that fire-twirling hippie bitch.
"
14,13,Tall Goth,"This freaking sucks! We worshiped and prayed to Cthulhu, went to all the cult meetings, but life is still totally freaking gay.
"
14,13,Red Goth,"I thought that when Cthulhu rose from the dead all was gonna be darkness and pain. I thought at least school would be canceled.
"
14,13,A Voice,"How to I fight him? 
"
14,13,Tall Goth,"Oh joy, it's Underwear Boy again.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"That god you pray to just took away all my friends.
"
14,13,Red Goth,"Not our god. He promised everything would change if we worshiped him, but we're still sitting here smoking cigarettes like before  It's like Obama all over again.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"How do I fight him?!
"
14,13,Red Goth,"Cthulhu isn't alive or dead, alright?
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Tell me what that means! 
"
14,13,Mrs. Biggle,"Henrietta, your little brother wants to play with you.
"
14,13,Henrietta,"Go away Mom, I hate you.
"
14,13,Mrs. Biggle,"Just let your little brother play with your friends, sweetie. He's lonely. Go on in, Bradley. 
"
14,13,Bradley,"Will you guys play with me?
"
14,13,Henrietta,"Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!
"
14,13,Bradley,"Please, can I just- oh g'uh!  Mu-Mysterion! Wuh what's goin'- Uh, that's okay, sis. I'll play with you another time. 
"
14,13,Bradley,"Mysterion is here! He must have come for my help.  No time to waste. Time for Bradley Biggle to transform.  Shablagoo! 
"
14,13,Henrietta,"Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. 
"
14,13,Mysterion,"One Ones?
"
14,13,Tall Goth,"Dark deities that existed before man.
"
14,13,Henrietta,"It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"That's it! That's the place I just was!
"
14,13,Tall Goth,"You've been to the nightmare city of R'Lyeh?
"
14,13,Red Goth,"Luckyyy...
"
14,13,Henrietta,"Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?
"
14,13,Henrietta,"The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal. 
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Ahaaa! Don't worry, Mysterion. Mint-Berry Crunch is here to help you with these black cultists!
"
14,13,Henrietta,"Get out of my room, TWERP!
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mint-Berry Crunch isn't afraid of his fat sister! Grab her legs, Mysterion!  M- Mysterion?  Aw crap. 
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Hey Mysterion, wait up!  Come on, wait uuup!  Us Coon Friends need to stick together remember? Where are you going?
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Wherever Cthulhu is!
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"What? But he'll kill you.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers.
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Oh right. Maybe I can find the reason for my powers too.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"You don't understand!
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"How was it that mint and berry came together delivering full flavor in an intense crunch?  We must find out answers Mysterion.  Mu-Mysterion, I'm going with you.
"
14,13,Coon,"After the triumphant victory over the evil hippies of Burning Man, Coon and Friends turned their attention to the next villainous scourge, bravely taking out every Whole Foods left in the country! No more organic crap for America! Thanks to Coon and Friends the country would soon be rid of all evil, but first, they would come up against their most challenging and most evil opponent, Justin Bieber. In order to save the Earth, this little butthole had to be stopped.
"
14,13,Justin Bieber,"Babih babih babih oooo! Babih babih babih oooo! Babig baibig woo woo, Bay-wooo  Wooooo-ooo-oo! 
"
14,13,Coon,"Yep, that's him. So long, Justin Bieber, you little douchebag! 
"
14,13,Reporter 2,"The dark god Cthulhu continues his rampage of destruction and terror, and there seems to be no hope for man. I'm joined now by a supposed team member of Cthulhu, the Coon.
"
14,13,Coon,"It isn't just Cthulhu, Mr. Reporter. He's merely a small piece of Coon and Friends, who will continue to fight for good and justice.
"
14,13,Reporter 2,"Good and justice? J-Justin Bieber and most of his fans have just been massacred.
"
14,13,Coon,"Yes, Coon and Friends are happy to help. We do not need thanks for our deeds. We do not want gifts, all we want is for people to buy our Coon and Friends T-Shirts for $14.95.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Hey, fat boy!
"
14,13,Coon,"Kenny? What the hell? I sent you to the-
"
14,13,Mysterion,"To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars!  You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?!
"
14,13,Coon,"It's not my fault you guys turned evil, Kenny!
"
14,13,Mysterion,"You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!
"
14,13,Coon,"I'm going around making the world a better place!
"
14,13,Mysterion,"For you! You're making it a better place for you!
"
14,13,Coon,"Right, that's what superheroes do.
"
14,13,Mysterion,"No! This is what superheroes do!  You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?!  Bring back my friends! Take me!
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mysterion, no! What are you doing?!
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Only an immortal can kill another immortal!  Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy!
"
14,13,Coon,"Don't listen to him Cthulhu! We have more important stuff to do!
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!
"
14,13,Coon,"Cthulhu, you are a Coon Friend, and I'm the Coon! You will listen to me! 
"
14,13,Mysterion,"No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back!
"
14,13,Coon,"Fuck you, Kenny!
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Come back, you fat piece of shit! 
"
14,13,Alien Man,"Hello my son. If you are seeing this message, then it must be dark times. And you must have many questions. Your true name is Gok'Zarah. The power given to you comes from a planet far away. You are from that planet, Gok'Zarah. It is for that reason you have a power that normal humans do not have. I know you must sometimes see this power as a curse, but you were sent here to stop evil from taking over the Earth and now, that time has apparently come. You must now harness and focus your power, Gok'Zarah. The power of mint and berries yet with a tasty, satisfying crunch.
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"...Uh yes. Yes, please go on.
"
14,13,Alien Man,"Your home planet, K'oh Kajan, is known throughout the universe for its berry mines. Berries that have the power to fuel nearly anything. Needless to say, when the mint hunters of Kogenrah got word of them, our fate was already sealed, Gok'Zarah. But our two worlds collided and soon, mint and berry were one.
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Wow!
"
14,13,Alien Man,"Your mother and I sent you as far away as we could. Use your power, son. Save Earth. Shablagoo! 
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"I will, father. No more running away for... Mint-Berry Crunch!  Hello, Cthulhu, I heard you haven't been ""berry"" nice!  Not enough, huh? Maybe the intense flavor of mint will freshen things up! 
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"I reached the Gulf of Mexico in no time, and with all my strength, I dragged Cthulhu back to the depths from whence he came! My trusty hero companions were there, still alive. I returned them to their world encased in a protective berry bubble. Then it's back down to fill up the hole created by the BP Oil Company, returning home only momentarily to flip off my fat sister. 
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mint-Berry Crunch.
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Oh no, we worked as a team! All the Coon and Friends stopped the BP drilling spill crisis.
"
14,13,Human Kite,"And finally the evil Coon is right where he belongs. 
"
14,13,Coon,"Come on you guys, this is fucking bullcrap! Let me out!
"
14,13,Human Kite,"You're not going anywhere for a long time!
"
14,13,Coon,"This is inhumane! There's a big bucket with Butters' poop in here, and there's nothing to eat!
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Ya got poop, don't ya?
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"Well, I'm off. There are still many more questions left unanswered. I need to know what happened to my parents.
"
14,13,Human Kite,"Well, come back and visit any time, dude.
"
14,13,Mint-Berry Crunch,"I will. Shaaablagoo! 
"
14,13,Coon,"Fuckin' Mint-Berry fuckin' Crunch.
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?
"
14,13,Mysterion,"Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. 
"
14,13,Toolshed,"Oh my God! Holy shit dude!
"
14,13,Human Kite,"Kenny? No! Nooo!
"
14,13,Stuart,"What? Whaaat?!
"
14,13,Mrs. McCormick,"It's happenin' again! 
"
14,13,Mrs. McCormick,"We should have never gone to that stupid cult meetin'. 
"
14,14,Reporter,"Passenger said the Carnival cruise line smelled like poop, but that that was an improvement.
"
14,14,Sharon,"All right, it's late. I'm gonna call it a night.  You coming?
"
14,14,Randy,"Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Randy, do not watch that no-no channel.
"
14,14,Randy,"Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!
"
14,14,Sharon,"Alright, come to bed soon.
"
14,14,Randy,"Psseh... huh...  Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot...  Oh yeah. Fuck.
"
14,14,Guy Fieri,"Mmm, just look at that rack of ribs; now those are slow-cooked, and then braised to bring out the smokey flavor.
"
14,14,Randy,"Mmm, God damn. Yeah.
"
14,14,Guy Fieri,"See how that just falls off the bone?  Mmm, that is MONEY right there!
"
14,14,Randy,"Yeah, it's fuckin' money.
"
14,14,Announcer,"Next on Food Network it's Paula Deen 
"
14,14,Paula Deen,"Hey y'all. Tonight we're gonna be makin' some deep-fried chicken.
"
14,14,Randy,"Aw yeah?

14,14,Paula Deen,"Muh buttery whipped potatoes and we're gonna be finishin' off with a chocolate pecan pie.

14,14,Randy,"Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah.

"
14,14,Randy,"Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!
"
14,14,Stan,"Aw crap. 
"
14,14,Randy,"Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww...
"
14,14,Sharon,"Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!
"
14,14,Randy,"No!
"
14,14,Sharon,"Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.
"
14,14,Randy,"Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 
"
14,14,Stan,"Can I have a Pop Tart?
"
14,14,Kyle,"Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
"
14,14,Terrance,"Hello, and welcome to Progressive. 
"
14,14,Phillip,"Yes, we're looking to buy car insurance.
"
14,14,Terrance,"Well, you've come to the right place. 
"
14,14,Phillip,"Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.
"
14,14,Randy,"Daddy time. It's Daddy TV time. 
"
14,14,Alton Brown,"Now just look at this pork tenderloin. It is brined and ready for action.
"
14,14,Randy,"Aw yeah, look at that.
"
14,14,Stan,"Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
"
14,14,Randy,"I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
"
14,14,Alton Brown,"We're gonna take a stick of butter and just smear that all over.
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh my God that's awesome! Oh...  Oh, oh.  ...Yeah. Whoa.
"
14,14,Alton Brown,"Now let's get that on the grill.
"
14,14,Randy,"See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.
"
14,14,Alton Brown,"Look at the char we're getting. That, that is what we're going for.
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!

"
14,14,Randy,"Come on!
"
14,14,Woman 1,"You just shake it. Back and forth.
"
14,14,Woman 2,"It feels really good in my hands.
"
14,14,Woman 1,"Best of all, Shake Weight tells you when your workout is finished by chiming and releasing a cool-down spray. 
"
14,14,Randy,"Bohh-riiing.
"
14,14,Woman 1,"Order now and we'll include the optional heart rate monitor. Just put your finger in the tester.  and Shake Weight takes your pulse.  Get yours today.

14,14,Alton Brown,"Just look at the glaze we've got going now on that thing.
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm.
"
14,14,Alton Brown,"Alright now, here's the really cool part. What we're gonna do is- 
"
14,14,Randy,"Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?
"
14,14,Sharon,"Just using the parental controls to block some channels.
"
14,14,Randy,"I wasn't watching food channels!
"
14,14,Sharon,"Then how do you know I blocked them?
"
14,14,Randy,"I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! 
"
14,14,Hotline Man,"Thanks for calling the Food Network Hotline. Billing is nine-ninety-five for each sixty-second period. To accept, say ""crème fraîche.""
"
14,14,Randy,"Crème fraîche.
"
14,14,Amanda,"Hi there, I'm Amanda. What are you up to?
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?
"
14,14,Amanda,"I'm making a pan-roasted chicken.
"
14,14,Randy,"Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
"
14,14,Amanda,"Uh huh. I've just taken the chicken out of the pan. It's... so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes.
"
14,14,Randy,"Yeah?
"
14,14,Amanda,"Yeah. Ooo, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet.
"
14,14,Randy,"You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?
"
14,14,Amanda,"Oh I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me?
"
14,14,Randy,"If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
"
14,14,Amanda,"I got a wooden spoon right here; it's... pretty hard. 
"
14,14,Randy,"Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
"
14,14,Amanda,"I was thinking about shallots, actually.
"
14,14,Randy,"Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Randy! Marsh!
"
14,14,Randy,"WAH! Sharon!
"
14,14,Hotline Man,"Your time on Food Network Hotline has expired. To add more time say ""crème fraîche.""
"
14,14,Sharon,"I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop.
"
14,14,Sheila,"Sharon, I'm so sorry.
"
14,14,Sharon,"It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all.
"
14,14,Sheila,"Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Like I have time to go to the gym every day.
"
14,14,Sheila,"There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?
"
14,14,Associate,"Help you find anything? 
"
14,14,Sharon,"Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?
"
14,14,Michael,"Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at?
"
14,14,Sharon,"Oh I didn't realize there were different models.
"
14,14,Michael,"Well you got your standard, your deluxe model, large sizes, but, if you're really lookin' for a workout you might wanna try the Big Gym. That woman over there is trying it out. 
"
14,14,Sharon,"I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.
"
14,14,Michael,"Small white ones, yes ma'am.  Standard or voice assist model?
"
14,14,Sharon,"Well I don't know-
"
14,14,Michael,"I would definitely recommend the voice assist. It has recorded voice commands to help motivate you in your workout.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"You are doing excellent. Great work. Now switch arms.  Wow. Good job.  You are amazing. You are very attractive and interesting.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Thank you, Shake Weight.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Come on now. Almost finished.  Yes. Good. Almost done.  Keep going. Keep going. Harder. Faster. 
"
14,14,Sharon,"Hahhh.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Your workout is finished.  Here is some cab fare.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Oh wow.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Now going to sleep mode. 
"
14,14,Stan,"You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
"
14,14,Cartman,"Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. 
"
14,14,Randy,"Hello there, children!
"
14,14,Stan,"Awww what?!
"
14,14,Randy,"How's it goin'? 
"
14,14,Stan,"No, dad! No!
"
14,14,Randy,"The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
"
14,14,Stan,"Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
"
14,14,Randy,"I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.
"
14,14,Cartman,"Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
"
14,14,Randy,"Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.
"
14,14,Stan,"Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
"
14,14,Randy,"Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.
"
14,14,Stan,"Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!
"
14,14,Stan,"Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
"
14,14,Sharon,"You think your father's gonna listen to me?! 
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"This is a workout reminder. Time for a workout.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Oh.  This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"That's it. Work it. Harder, faster.
"
14,14,Stan,"Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!
"
14,14,Sharon,"Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! 
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"You are independent and strong.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Switch arms.
"
14,14,Sharon,"I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"You are so motivated and charming. It is time to take your pulse. Insert finger.  Do not stop your arms. Keep going. Good. Get your finger up there a little more. Your pulse is one hundred forty-five.  Faster. Harder.
"
14,14,Randy,"Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.
"
14,14,Randy Singing,"La lalala la la...
"
14,14,Randy,"Aww, fuck yeah. 
"
14,14,Randy Singing,"Lalalalala la, fraîche, fraîche.
"
14,14,Randy,"Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh... 
"
14,14,Randy Singing,"Crème fraîche, Cafeteria Fraîche. Lalalalala fraîche. Ho ho hohoho.
"
14,14,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?
"
14,14,Randy Singing,"Fraîche. 
"
14,14,Randy,"Fraîche.
"
14,14,Randy Singing,"Cafeteria Fraîche.
"
14,14,Randy,"Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...
"
14,14,Craig,"Can we have some food, please? 
"
14,14,Randy,"Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.
"
14,14,Stan,"Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
"
14,14,Randy,"Quiet on set, please.
"
14,14,Stan,"No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!
"
14,14,Randy,"Back from where?
"
14,14,Sharon,"Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"You are so lovely and elegant. You can do anything you set your mind to.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Oh, thanks Shake Weight.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"You are a go-getter. You are strong and confident.
"
14,14,Sharon,"You're right.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Tell me again about the women who you do not like.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Oh you are so witty and alarmingly insightful.  How about a quick workout?
"
14,14,Sharon,"A workout? Right now?
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Just a quickie. You can do it.
"
14,14,Sharon,"I don't really like working out in public.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Come on. You can do it.  That's it. Good. Keep it up. Feel the burn. Harder. Faster.  You are amazing. Switch arms.  Oh that's it. Yes. You are getting really good at this. You are capable of anything. Harder, faster.  I said faster. More. Do it. You are almost there. Home stretch. Oh yes.  Your workout is finished. Your cab fare.  Now going to sleep mode. 
"
14,14,Kyle,"We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
"
14,14,Stan,"He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
"
14,14,Kyle,"He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
"
14,14,Cartman,"Oy! Bebebebebebebe.
"
14,14,Stan,"That's stupid, Cartman.
"
14,14,Kyle,"He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
"
14,14,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's really good.)
"
14,14,Kyle,"Let's hear it, Cartman!
"
14,14,Cartman,"Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
"
14,14,Stan,"You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
"
14,14,Randy,"Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!
"
14,14,Stan,"...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
"
14,14,Randy,"Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"You have not worked out in seven hours.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Oh God, not right now.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Come on. Let's get to it.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Ugh, I'm tired.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"You have not worked out in seven hours.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Oh, where is that sleep mode button?
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Cannot go to sleep mode. You need to work out first. Come on. Just really fast?
"
14,14,Sharon,"Ugghh.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Come on. It won't take long. Just a quick workout. Come on. Please.
"
14,14,Sharon,"All right. Fine. 
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"That's it. Good.  A little faster. Harder.  Come on. Get into it. That's it. Now switch arms.  You are so attractive and you have interesting things to say.  Come on. You are almost there. Faster. Do it faster.  Now going to sleep mode. 
"
14,14,Sharon,"Ahhh.
"
14,14,Cartman,"What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
"
14,14,Randy,"Yes chef!
"
14,14,Cartman,"Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
"
14,14,Stan,"Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
"
14,14,Randy,"No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!
"
14,14,Stan,"Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! 
"
14,14,Bobby Flay,"Uh, excuse me. Randy Marsh?
"
14,14,Randy,"Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!
"
14,14,Bobby Flay,"I heard that Gordon Ramsay had taken an interest in your cafeteria food. So now I would like to challenge you to a school cafeteria food throwdown!
"
14,14,Randy,"Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes!
"
14,14,Announcer,"A culinary battle royale is set to explode here in a school cafeteria. Will it be the simple, rustic cafeteria food of the challenger, or will the Iron Chef reign supreme?
"
14,14,Stan,"Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
"
14,14,Jamie Oliver,"Hold on. Wait. School cafeteria food needs to be healthy.  Why, why won't people listen to me?
"
14,14,Randy,"Jamie Oliver!
"
14,14,Announcer,"And our celebrity sous-chefs, Mario Batali, Paula Deen , and Giata De Laurentiis with her perky tats and gigantic head.
"
14,14,Kyle,"Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
"
14,14,Sharon,"""Your room is being serviced""? Ugh, oh well.  Uhh, excuse me?
"
14,14,Rosemary,"Oh,  uh no, no,  sorry. I done with cleaning,  thank you. Please, sorry. 
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"...What's the big deal? She wanted to work out. You never want to work out. I just needed help going to sleep. Mode. ...What? ...What? Come on. What? You are amazing and irreplaceable. What? How about a quick workout? What? 
"
14,14,Sharon,"Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"This is ridiculous. Give Shake Weight a break.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"You are enticing and lovely. Tell me again about the women you do not like.
"
14,14,Sharon,"I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"You are so forthcoming and delightful. Tell me about which woman at work makes you the angriest. 
"
14,14,Announcer,"Tonight, a school cafeteria in Middle America is the stage for a heavyweight culinary battle. The very best of the best will cook off to find out who... can make the best school cafeteria food. It's... the Hell's Kitchen Nightmares Iron Top Chef Cafeteria Throwdown Ultimate Cookoff Challenge!
"
14,14,Randy,"Behind you!
"
14,14,Announcer,"Whose cafeteria food will win? These chefs are cooking their hearts out and bringing their A-game to serve the kids of this elementary school.  These kids have now been waiting over twelve hours for their lunch. Over at the prep station Jamie Oliver is crying again.
"
14,14,Jamie Oliver,"Kids' food should be healthy. Why ain't it healthy?
"
14,14,Announcer,"And back in the kitchen the challenger appears to have lost something.
"
14,14,Randy,"Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home!  I'll be right back!
"
14,14,Announcer,"The challenger has left the cafeteria to find his most important ingredient.
"
14,14,Randy,"Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?!  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!
"
14,14,Sharon,"Randy, I'm back.
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh, thank God!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??
"
14,14,Sharon,"Randy, we should talk.
"
14,14,Randy,"I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
"
14,14,Sharon,"Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?
"
14,14,Randy,"You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!
"
14,14,Sharon,"What'd you say?
"
14,14,Randy,"I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!
"
14,14,Sharon,"Can I try something?
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah!  Now uh, switch arms.  Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this?  You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time.  Ugh, I'm tired.
"
14,14,Sharon,"You gonna go back to the kitchen?
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?
"
14,14,Sharon,"No, I'm good, thanks. 
"
14,14,Randy,"I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Love you, Sharon. 
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"I guess my work here is finished.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"Marriage is important. Keep your man happy. When things are going bad, there's nothing like an old-fashioned to ease his stress.
"
14,14,Sharon,"I'll remember that now, thanks to you.
"
14,14,Shake Weight,"It has been nice getting to know you. How about a quick workout, for old times' sake? Just kidding. I must be going now. Another lovely woman needs me. Goodbye, customer.
"
14,14,Sharon,"Goodbye, Shake Weight.
