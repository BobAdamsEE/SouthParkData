12,1,Cartman,"AHHHHHH.
"
12,1,Dentist,"Well, there's no doubt about it. Those tonsils need to come out.
"
12,1,Cartman,"What?
"
12,1,Liane,"Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?
"
12,1,Dentist,"It's a very simple operation. We'll just put you to sleep, Eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free!
"
12,1,Cartman,"No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
"
12,1,Dentist,"Oh, I thought you were a tough kid! You're not scared of hospitals, are you?
"
12,1,Cartman,"No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
"
12,1,Dentist,"Well then I guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either.
"
12,1,Cartman,"...Ice cream?
"
12,1,Dentist,"It'd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who aren't scared of hospitals.
"
12,1,Liane,"What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?
"
12,1,Cartman,"Well...you did say free ice cream? 
"
12,1,Liane,"Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Uh. It's over?
"
12,1,Liane,"That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!
"
12,1,Liane,"I'm so proud of you, Eric.
"
12,1,Cartman,"All right, so where's my ice cream?
"
12,1,Liane,"Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor.
"
12,1,Cartman,"You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
"
12,1,Doctor,"No, it's not. Eric, I'm afraid that we've accidentally infected you with the AIDS virus.
"
12,1,Liane,"...What!?
"
12,1,Cartman,"What's that supposed to mean?!
"
12,1,Doctor,"During the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. A mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with HIV. It was a one in a billion fluke.
"
12,1,Cartman,"I HAVE AIDS?
"
12,1,Doctor,"Not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes AIDS. We are very sorry.
"
12,1,Cartman,"""SORRY""?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE ""SORRY""?!
"
12,1,Liane,"Oh, my poor little baby!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
"
12,1,Liane,"Oh God!  Oh no!
"
12,1,Cartman,"No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
"
12,1,Doctor,"We're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you, Eric. For starters, I think I owe you some ice cream. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
"
12,1,Liane,"Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!
"
12,1,Cartman,"NO! NOOOOOOOO!
"
12,1,Principal Victoria,"Thank you for coming, everyone. 
"
12,1,Principal Victoria,"Boys, please take a seat.
"
12,1,Stan,"What's going on? Are we in trouble?
"
12,1,Principal Victoria,"Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV.
"
12,1,Stan,"...What?
"
12,1,Butters,"Oh no.
"
12,1,Doctor 2,"He's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion. The disease is in very early stages and completely manageable, but he's naturally a bit scared.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Cartman has HIV?
"
12,1,Doctor 2,"We need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from Eric. You can still give him hugs and even kisses. Don't be afraid of him, just-
"
12,1,Kyle,"Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
"
12,1,Principal Victoria,"All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?
"
12,1,Mr. Mackey,"Eric? Come on in, your friends want to say ""Hi"", m'kay? 
"
12,1,Kyle,"...No. Way.
"
12,1,Butters,"How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"God damn it, this sucks ass!
"
12,1,Kyle,"...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
"
12,1,Butters,"Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
"
12,1,Doctor 2,"No, you're not going to die, Eric. AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment and-
"
12,1,Cartman,"Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
"
12,1,M.C.,"We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Where the hell is everybody? 
"
12,1,Liane,"Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?
"
12,1,Waitress,"This is everyone. We didn't sell that many tickets.
"
12,1,Butters,"Great benefit, Eric!
"
12,1,Jimmy,"The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.
"
12,1,Cartman,"So this is it?
"
12,1,Waitress,"I'm afraid AIDS benefits aren't as popular as they used to be. AIDS was more the '80s/'90s disease. It's all about cancer now. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
"
12,1,M.C.,"With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Just bring out Elton John already!
"
12,1,M.C.,"Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit.
"
12,1,Waitress,"It's all right, we got somebody better: Jimmy Buffett!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Jimmy Buffett?!
"
12,1,Jimmy Buffett,"Hello everyone. I wrote this song for a very brave little boy.
AIDSburger in paradise!
AIDSburger and it ain't nice!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
"
12,1,Jimmy Buffett,"A little boy in South Park
Dyin' of AIDS in the cold dark
How he got AIDS I haven't a clue.
Wastin' away again because of AIDS and stuff
How are we all feelin' tonight?
"
12,1,Cartman,"Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!
"
12,1,Liane,"Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.
"
12,1,Stan,"Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
"
12,1,Stan,"Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
"
12,1,Cartman,"...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
"
12,1,Kyle,"I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
"
12,1,Cartman,"No you don't!
"
12,1,Kyle,"I do. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!
"
12,1,Kyle,"I'm sorry. I gotta go home. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!
"
12,1,Stan,"He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Ironic how?
"
12,1,Stan,"Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
"
12,1,Cartman,"Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!
"
12,1,Stan,"Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
"
12,1,Butters,"Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.
"
12,1,Cartman,"All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 
"
12,1,Butters,"Okay, but... what are you going to do?
"
12,1,Cartman,"Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
"
12,1,Butters,"I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
"
12,1,Butters,"I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
"
12,1,Cartman,"I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
"
12,1,Butters,"Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.
"
12,1,Cartman,"All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
"
12,1,Butters,"Wow, you really know what you're doing.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 
"
12,1,Kyle,"Wagh.
"
12,1,Sheila,"There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.  Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?
"
12,1,Dr. Doctor,"No, it isn't strep...
"
12,1,Sheila,"Oh, well there's a relief.
"
12,1,Dr. Doctor,"...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?
"
12,1,Sheila,"No, why?
"
12,1,Dr. Doctor,"Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?
"
12,1,Kyle,"What? No?!
"
12,1,Sheila,"Doctor, what are you saying?
"
12,1,Dr. Doctor,"We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.
"
12,1,Kyle,"What?
"
12,1,Sheila,"HIV?
"
12,1,Dr. Doctor,"It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt.
"
12,1,Sheila,"No, that's impossible!
"
12,1,Dr. Doctor,"Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice?
"
12,1,Kyle,"No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
"
12,1,Sheila,"Kyle? Kyle!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!
"
12,1,Kyle,"I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Kyle, what?!
"
12,1,Stan,"What did he do?
"
12,1,Kyle,"Why do I have HIV?!
"
12,1,Clyde,"...Oh...
"
12,1,Cartman,"Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
"
12,1,Kyle,"What did you do?!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Nothing!
"
12,1,Kyle,"Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. 
"
12,1,Kyle,"Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
"
12,1,Kyle,"AAAAAAA! 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Kyle!
"
12,1,Kyle,"Here you go!  Here you go! 
"
12,1,Mr.Mackey,"Hey! Hey, that's enough! Break it up, m'kay?!  Break it up! Hm'kay?!  M'kay!
"
12,1,Principal Victoria,"All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?
"
12,1,Kyle,"He gave me AIDS!
"
12,1,Principal Victoria,"What?
"
12,1,Kyle,"He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
"
12,1,Principal Victoria,"Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?
"
12,1,Cartman,"Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
"
12,1,Principal Victoria,"Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Kind of.
"
12,1,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, that is not appropriate behavior, m'kay? You cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease!
"
12,1,Principal Victoria,"That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.
"
12,1,Cartman,"I'm sorry.
"
12,1,Kyle,"An apology?!
"
12,1,Principal Victoria,"You're sorry for what, Eric?
"
12,1,Cartman,"I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
"
12,1,Principal Victoria,"That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.
"
12,1,Kyle,"...What?!
"
12,1,Mr. Mackey,"Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?
"
12,1,Kyle,"A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
"
12,1,Cartman,"See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?
"
12,1,Kyle,"I'm going to break everything that you own! 
"
12,1,Cartman,"What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!
"
12,1,Kyle,"There is no cure, you asshole!
"
12,1,Cartman,"No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
"
12,1,Kyle,"What hope?!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
"
12,1,Kyle,"You're lying!
"
12,1,Cartman,"NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Magic Johnson?
"
12,1,Cartman,"He was a basketball player.
"
12,1,Kyle,"So what?!
"
12,1,Cartman,"So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
"
12,1,Kyle,"You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
"
12,1,Cartman,"My God...
"
12,1,Cartman,"We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
"
12,1,Clerk,"Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
"
12,1,Clerk,"...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
"
12,1,Kyle,"Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
"
12,1,Clerk,"Oh, you boys are  like that, huh?
"
12,1,Kyle,"NO!
"
12,1,Clerk,"Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
"
12,1,Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
"
12,1,Clerk,"Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?
"
12,1,Cartman,"Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! 
"
12,1,Flight Attendant,"We're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. What kind of cancer did you say you have again?
"
12,1,Cartman,"Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
"
12,1,Flight Attendant,"I'm so sorry
"
12,1,Cartman,"Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.
"
12,1,Flight Attendant,"Hm, I don't know. These days I think I'd rather have AIDS than cancer.
"
12,1,Cartman,"No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Don't. Touch me.
"
12,1,Cartman,"I know. I'm scared too.
"
12,1,Butler,"Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time. 
"
12,1,Kyle,"Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
"
12,1,Magic,"You boys both have the virus? Are you sure?
"
12,1,Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Kyle, we need to try to find a-
"
12,1,Kyle,"What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
"
12,1,Cartman,"I don't think it's funny, Kyle.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
"
12,1,Kyle,"Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Are you sure?
"
12,1,Kyle,"Yes!!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!
"
12,1,Magic,"Boys, the truth is I don't know why my body is so resistant to the virus. I would love to know so I could help others, but I just don't. 
"
12,1,Kyle,"Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
"
12,1,Magic,"Well, not at all.
"
12,1,Magic,"The pool is over there , where I try to swim and stay in shape. My kitchen  is full of pretty healthy food. I don't know which thing it is that keeps my T-cell count high, so I... try it all.
"
12,1,Kyle,"But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
"
12,1,Magic,"Sure.
"
12,1,Magic,"Just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom. 
"
12,1,Kyle,"Dude.
"
12,1,Magic,"Oh, oh yeah, I- I don't trust banks. I sleep with all my money.
"
12,1,Kyle,"You sleep with money. Every night?
"
12,1,Magic,"Yeah, I like to keep it close b- ...You don't think that..?
"
12,1,Scientist 1,"It's incredible. Mitch, these boys could be onto something. Take a look.  That's a sample of HIV-infected blood. You can clearly see the HIV attacking the white blood cells, right?  All right. Watch what happens when we introduce some cash. 
"
12,1,Mitch,"My God. The HIV particles are receding! 
"
12,1,Scientist 1,"The cash does seem to retrain the HIV cells from stabilizing.
"
12,1,Scientist 2,"Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
"
12,1,Mitch,"Then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether.
"
12,1,Magic,"I have enough cash for all three of us! We should give it a try!
"
12,1,Scientist 2,"Na-noo, it's ridiculous. We need FDA approval, control studies! I'm sorry, but this is impossible!
"
12,1,Magic,"These boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen.  Their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illness-ridden lives.
"
12,1,Scientist 2,"Their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world, that's for sure.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Wugh.
"
12,1,Scientist 2,"I suppose we could try to distill Magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it's very risky.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
"
12,1,Mitch,"Let's hope to Christ this works. 
"
12,1,Scientist 1,"Wait a minute... Yes... Yes, take a look!  The cash particles have completely replaced all the HIV in Kyle's blood!  Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS.
"
12,1,Cartman,"All right!
"
12,1,Scientist 1,"They found the cure for AIDS!  The cure for AIDS!
"
12,1,Scientist 3,"What is it?
"
12,1,Scientist 1,"Large doses of concentrated cash!  Get the media on the phone!
"
12,1,Scientist 4,"All right!
"
12,1,Anchorman,"Scientists have just discovered the cure... for AIDS.  About a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream.
"
12,1,Driver,"Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!
"
12,1,M.C.,"I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman.  Together these boys beat their illness. With nothing but each other, and overcoming all odds , these two brave friends-
"
12,1,Kyle,"Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
"
12,1,M.C.,"These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys , here is... Jimmy Buffett!
"
12,1,Cartman,"What?! Aw, no!
"
12,1,Jimmy Buffett,"Cureburger in paradise!
Cureburger. There I said it twice!
"
12,1,Cartman,"What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.
"
12,1,Kyle,"I'm still breaking your Xbox. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"What? No. No.  Kyle, no!
"
12,2,Announcer,"Live, from Chicago, Illinois, it's Decision 2008.
"
12,2,Moderator,"Good evening and welcome to the political debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama.  First question: How do you see yourself as different from your opponent?
"
12,2,Stan,"Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
"
12,2,Randy,"This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.
"
12,2,Cartman,"Yeah, but we totally don't.
"
12,2,Randy,"Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
"
12,2,Moderator,"And so, Mr. Obama, why don't you tell us your stance on military spending?
"
12,2,Barack Obama,"Well, my opinion is that-
"
12,2,Announcer,"We interrupt this debate for an emergency news bulletin! It's... Britney Watch!  Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
"
12,2,Butters,"Man...
"
12,2,Randy,"Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?
"
12,2,Anchorman,"Britney Spears has been spotted camping in the Colorado mountains, and one report claims that she has taken a piss... in the forest. Robert Pooner has more.
"
12,2,Robert Pooner,"Ron, I'm standing in South Mark, Colorado, where Britney Spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all. 
"
12,2,Cartman,"Aw dude, that's our town!
"
12,2,Robert Pooner,"Ms. Spears was spotted at a mountain campground , and you won't believe what she did, Ron. The troubled diva took a piss. Right on a ladybug. We've blurred out parts of the photo so that it doesn't offend. 
"
12,2,Randy,"She's such a train wreck!
"
12,2,Robert Pooner,"When the photo is enhanced, Ron, you can see the poor little ladybug getting doused. 
"
12,2,Ron,"This must be very embarrassing for Britney that this photo got out, Bob, and, and she looks like she's gained weight.
"
12,2,Robert Pooner,"That's right, Ron, she really chubbed up. And if you zoom in on her face, you can see that she's got some zits! 
"
12,2,Butters,"Aw, poor girl.
"
12,2,Randy,"Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug. 
"
12,2,Ron,"The photograph was taken by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado , who sold it to 31 News for a hundred thousand dollars.
"
12,2,Kyle,"A hundred thousand dollars?
"
12,2,Cartman,"That's enough to buy slaves!
"
12,2,Ron,"Britney is said to be now hiding out in a South Park motel. Aand now back to the stupid Democratic debates.
"
12,2,Hillary Clinton,"...and spearchuckers.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
"
12,2,Stan,"And she's at a hotel in our town. 
"
12,2,Kyle,"It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
"
12,2,Cartman,"Sweet!
"
12,2,Butters,"Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
"
12,2,Stan,"Butters, don't be such a pussy.
"
12,2,Butters,"Hokay. 
"
12,2,Kyle,"A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
"
12,2,Butters,"Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 
"
12,2,Stan,"Oh no.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
"
12,2,Photographer 1,"Join the club.
"
12,2,Photographer 2,"Yeah, all you amateur photographers are makin' this tougher on the professionals!
"
12,2,Cartman,"We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! 
"
12,2,Guard,"Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs.
"
12,2,Kyle,"We uh, we have special permission?
"
12,2,Stan,"Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
"
12,2,Guard,"You are?
"
12,2,Butters,"Not me! I'm a squirrel!
"
12,2,Britney,"But now everybody thinks I hate ladybugs. I didn't even know it was there. I can't take it anymore. I'm just sooo- 
"
12,2,Guard,"Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are here and they've brought you a squirrel.
"
12,2,Britney,"My boys? Really? Send them in.  It's okay. My kids are here. I feel better now. 
"
12,2,Kyle,"We did it guys!
"
12,2,Stan,"I told you that would work!
"
12,2,The Boys,"Yehehahah, all right!
"
12,2,Kyle,"Ahall right!
"
12,2,Britney,"You mean, it was just a joke? My kids ain't here?
"
12,2,Kyle,"All right. Butters, go get next to her.
"
12,2,Butters,"I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
"
12,2,Stan,"Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
"
12,2,Britney,"You're never gonna leave me alone, are you?
"
12,2,Butters,"It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 
"
12,2,Kyle,"All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
"
12,2,Stan,"Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
"
12,2,Cartman,"All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.
"
12,2,Britney,"I've got a better idea.
"
12,2,Stan,"You do?
"
12,2,Britney,"Yeah. 
"
12,2,"Stan, Kyle","NO! 
"
12,2,Butters,"You killed her! 
"
12,2,Guard,"Hey, everything all right u-. Oh.
"
12,2,Nurse,"Paging Dr. Bender? Paging Dr. Bender, please? 
"
12,2,Stan,"We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
"
12,2,Kyle,"How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
"
12,2,Doctor,"She's... alive.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Whew.
"
12,2,Stan,"Oh, thank God.
"
12,2,Doctor,"But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone?
"
12,2,Kyle,"Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
"
12,2,Doctor,"I don't want you making her upset.
"
12,2,Stan,"We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
"
12,2,Doctor,"All right.
"
12,2,Doctor,"Ms. Spears, these boys wanted to say something. 
"
12,2,Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
12,2,Stan,"Oh no!
"
12,2,Doctor,"The boys are just shocked at how good you look, Britney.  Right, boys?!
"
12,2,Kyle,"Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 
"
12,2,Doctor,"Well, I'll let you boys have your say. 
"
12,2,Stan,"Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Oh, God, what have we done?!
"
12,2,Announcer,"It's Britney Watch! Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
"
12,2,Reporter,"You won't believe what Britney's done now. The troubled pop star has just been spotted with a crazy ""no top part of my head"" look. This video  was taken just hours ago as Britney was wheeled into the hospital for some reason. And if we zoom in on the footage, right, ri-right here , you can also definitely see a boob job scar. No doubt now that she's had plastic surgery in the past.
"
12,2,Anchorman,"O ho ho, oh houch, that's gotta be embarrassing. Chris, any word on why Ms. Spears went for this radical ""no top of the head"" look?
"
12,2,Chris,"No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Dude! 
"
12,2,Doctor,"Damn it, she can't handle any stress right now!
"
12,2,Manager,"Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager.  Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this.
"
12,2,Britney,"Guglo.
"
12,2,Manager,"Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.
"
12,2,Paparazzo,"Brit! Over here, Brit. One for Star Weekly. 
"
12,2,Doctor,"Damn it you have to take her out of here; she can't be around all this right now.
"
12,2,Britney,"Right. We need to take her home. Boys, can you give me a hand with her?
"
12,2,Stan,"Yeah, of course. 
"
12,2,Manager,"Okay, come on!  My car is right here. 
"
12,2,Photographer 3,"Hey look!
"
12,2,Photographer 4,"There she is! 
"
12,2,Kyle,"Oh crap! 
"
12,2,Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
12,2,Manager,"Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time.  Thank you! Yes, thanks. 
"
12,2,Stan,"Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
"
12,2,Manager,"That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away.
"
12,2,Kyle,"What?!
"
12,2,Manager,"All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
"
12,2,Sound Engineer,"All right, Brit, let's try it from the top. 
"
12,2,Female Aide,"God, what a train wreck.
"
12,2,Male Aide,"She must be stoned again. 
"
12,2,Stan,"Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.
"
12,2,Manager,"Whattaya mean? She sounds great.  Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be ""love elation"". Sounds more like you're saying ""love creation"".
"
12,2,Britney,"Gogehah.
"
12,2,Manager,"E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.
"
12,2,Britney,"Egeul-gageol
"
12,2,Sound Engineer,"Gah, she's so stupid.
"
12,2,Stan,"What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
"
12,2,Sound Engineer,"I know. She's really dumb, huh? 
"
12,2,Stan,"No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!
"
12,2,Sound Engineer,"Yeah. And she's all fat, too.
"
12,2,Britney,"Okel?
"
12,2,Announcer,"Live, from Las Vegas, it's the MTV Video Music Awards
"
12,2,VJ,"What's up, y'all? It's the MTV Awards and we are kickin' it off right. Here to perform her new song is the one, and only, Britney Spears! 
"
12,2,Kyle,"Aw come on now, people! 
"
12,2,Woman,"Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby. 
"
12,2,Singers,"The way she fee-els.  Love inside.
"
12,2,Man,"Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing.
"
12,2,Stan,"She doesn't have any lips!
"
12,2,Singers,"Temporary.  So hot! 
"
12,2,Reporter,"Disaster at the MTV awards. People are ridiculing Britney Spears. Her performance was awful, Tom. She looked tired, she looked fat, she didn't have a head. It was just completely phoned in. No doubt, Tom, that girl has major issues.
"
12,2,Manager,"Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow.  Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute. 
"
12,2,Stan,"We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
"
12,2,Stan,"I know where.
"
12,2,Stan,"We want three tickets to the North Pole. 
"
12,2,Clerk,"The North Pole?  Who the hell goes to the North Pole?
"
12,2,Stan,"We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. 
"
12,2,Announcer,"It's Britney Wowtch!
"
12,2,Ron,"A distraught Britney Spears has apparently disappeared and abandoned all those close to her. A local housewife caught a photo of Britney running away in this disguise! 
"
12,2,Robert Pooner,"Britney is obviously very upset about her MTV performance, Ron, and so she's become desperate. Most troubling for her is the fact that her disguise has total camel toe. 
"
12,2,Ron,"Oooooh, ouch!
"
12,2,Anchorwoman,"Oh boy, now, Leslie, this seems like a really bad camel toe offense.
"
12,2,Leslie,"Absolutely major camel toe, Tracy. Britney just seems oblivious. She was bound to get noticed: you walk around with that kind of cam toe and you're gonna turn heads.
"
12,2,Ron,"Eh, David, any idea as to how big the camel toe actually was? 
"
12,2,Robert Pooner,"She was sportin' toe like never before, Brian. I, I don't know what's wrong with that girl, but, it's a slap in the face to camels all over the planet.
"
12,2,Ron,"Those close to Britney say they are very worried and want to bring her home safe. And now back to the local news.
"
12,2,Tracy,"The giant squirrel which was picked up last week by animal control apparently now thinks it's a person. Colorado officials have taken the squirrel to Johns-Hopkins for psychiatric evaluation.
"
12,2,Ron,"Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
"
12,2,Paparazzo,"There she is! It's Britney! 
"
12,2,Stan,"Oh no. 
"
12,2,Stan,"Dude, they're never gonna let us through.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Yes they are! I have an idea.
"
12,2,Paparazzo 2,"Britney? Where'd she go?
"
12,2,Paparazzo 3,"There she is! 
"
12,2,Stan,"It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. 
"
12,2,Manager,"There she is. Hey Britney, it's me.  Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?
"
12,2,Reporter,"Hey, wait a minute. Where's her camel toe?!
"
12,2,Kyle,"I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!
"
12,2,Paparazzo 5,"Ooo, psych!
"
12,2,Manager,"She must be back at the train station; come on! 
"
12,2,Kyle,"Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
"
12,2,Paparazzo 6,"Son, you don't seem to understand. Britney Spears... has to die.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Huh? 
"
12,2,Paparazzo 7,"What do you think all this effort has been for?
"
12,2,Manager,"It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.
"
12,2,Officer,"She must... die.
"
12,2,Background Singers,"Hetus. Alte omnebus.  Virtu e poquebus. 
"
12,2,Narrator,"Little Stanley was tired and hungry. But he knew that for Britney Spears to be safe, he had to get her to the North Pole.
"
12,2,Stan,"You doing okay, Ms. Spears? 
"
12,2,Conductor,"It's her. Um no, I'm sure it's Britney Spears;  it looks just like the picture.  You want me to, to what? Yes, I understand.  Rectus. Hoc honebus
"
12,2,Elderly Man,"Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town.
"
12,2,Kyle,"What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
"
12,2,Bob Summers,"Well nobody wants her to die, little boy. We all simply... need her to. Do you understand?
"
12,2,Kyle,"NO!
"
12,2,Paparazzo 8,"Look, kid, throughout history people have found it necessary to engage in... human sacrifice.
"
12,2,Bob Summers,"In ancient times, humans would commonly pick one lovely girl, adorn her with jewels, treat her like a goddess, and then... watch her die.
"
12,2,Paparazzo 9,"We like to think we're more civilized now, but the truth is our lust for torture and death is no different than it was in gladidator times.
"
12,2,Paparazzo 10,"Only difference is that now we like to watch people put to death through magazines and photographs.
"
12,2,Canadian Paparazzo,"It's a damn shame too. Old ways were bettah. Used to be we just picked someone by lottery and then stoned them to death.
"
12,2,Woman,"Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
"
12,2,Kyle,"You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
"
12,2,Man,"Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest.
"
12,2,Paparazzo 11,"All right, everyone's about here.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
"
12,2,Male passenger,"Hey, where are we? This isn't right. 
"
12,2,Stan,"Oh no!
"
12,2,Britney,"Ohhh thoooo!
"
12,2,Stan,"Come on, Britney!  Come on, come on! 
"
12,2,Kyle,"Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
"
12,2,Gerald,"It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Be a good boy? You know all about this?
"
12,2,Stan,"Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
"
12,2,Kyle,"She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
"
12,2,Stan,"Sacrificed? For what?
"
12,2,Randy,"For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.
"
12,2,Canadian Paparazzo,"Sacrifice in March, corn have plenty starch.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Corn harvest!
"
12,2,Randy,"We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.
"
12,2,Stan,"All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
"
12,2,Manager,"The kid is right. This has gone on too long.
"
12,2,Paparazzo 12,"Yeah. She was supposed to have killed herself a long time ago.
"
12,2,Farmer,"And harvest is coming soon.
"
12,2,Bob Summers,"All right, folks, let's finish this quickly. 
"
12,2,Stan,"No wait. 
"
12,2,Woman 2,"Come on, hurry up.
"
12,2,Woman 3,"I can't run. You go ahead, I'll catch up with ya. 
"
12,2,Mother,"Here Davey. 
"
12,2,Bob Summers,"Hold on. 
"
12,2,Doctor,"She's dead.
"
12,2,Randy,"Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. 
"
12,2,Gil,"Mornin' Bill.
"
12,2,Bill,"Mornin' Gil.
"
12,2,Gil,"Nice-lookin' corn.
"
12,2,Sheila,"Hey Sharon, Randy, great harvest, huh? 
"
12,2,Randy,"An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
"
12,2,ET Reporter,"She's the daughter of a country singer, and the young girl has really taken the country by storm. Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus, though only fifteen years old, is already on her way to being a major superstar.
"
12,2,Jimbo,"Hey, check it out! 
"
12,2,Randy,"Looks like next harvest will be even better. 
"
12,3,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it ""The Choking Game"", hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?
"
12,3,Kyle,"You can get high from choking yourself? 
"
12,3,Mr. Mackey,"Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?
"
12,3,Butters,"Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Cat pee? 
"
12,3,Stan,"That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?
"
12,3,Mr. Mackey,"Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay?  Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad.
"
12,3,Cartman,"All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? 
"
12,3,Kyle,"You guys are wasting your time.
"
12,3,Stan,"Yeah, this is not gonna work.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Okay, ready Kenny?
"
12,3,Kenny,"(All set.)
"
12,3,Cartman,"All right, bring out...! The other male cat. 
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Ow.)
"
12,3,Kyle,"Whoa! 
"
12,3,Stan,"Do you feel anything?
"
12,3,Cartman,"Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? 
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Hey cool! Check it out!)
"
12,3,Father,"I see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Yeahhh!)
"
12,3,Father,"Then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of Varnov. Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Okay.) 
"
12,3,Cartman,"Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!
"
12,3,Kenny,"(What?)  (Where'd she go?) 
"
12,3,Cartman,"Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(You fucking asshole!)
"
12,3,Cartman,"Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
"
12,3,Kenny,"(What the fuck did you do that for?)
"
12,3,Cartman,"Ah, Kenny! 
"
12,3,Kyle,"Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)
"
12,3,Stan,"What titties?
"
12,3,Kenny,"(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)
"
12,3,Kyle,"Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
"
12,3,Stan,"Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(I almost... touched them.)
"
12,3,Kyle,"Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
"
12,3,Announcer,"Next on FOX News!  It's the newest drug craze. and it's killing your kids! 
"
12,3,Gerald,"Killing our kids? 
"
12,3,Reporter,"All over America, kids are getting high... on cat urine!  Huffing cat urine apparently causes a euphoric state  and is also referred to as... cheesing.  Why ""cheesing""? Because it's ""fon to due"".  This sixth grade girl said she's been snorting cat piss for several months.
"
12,3,Girl,"We sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named _________ goes and gets her cats, and we'll just cheese all day long.
"
12,3,Gerald,"Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
"
12,3,Reporter,"So how can you tell if your child is cheesing? 
1. Your child seems distant, preoccupied.
2. Your child's face smells like cat urine.
3. When you see tigers at the zoo, your child starts grinding his or her teeth.
You might also notice by certain phrases your child says to school friends, such as ""Hey, let's go cheese."" or ""Do you feel like cheesing, guys?"" or ""Dude, I'm cheesing my F-ing brains out right now.""
"
12,3,Sheila,"Kids are doing this?
"
12,3,Reporter,"Kids do it because it's legal.  What can you do before it's too late? 
"
12,3,Gerald,"We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.
"
12,3,Gerald,"Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as ""the cheese game"", or ""vitamin cheese"", or ""Mary Jane piss in your face fun time"". Cheesing is spreading fast.
"
12,3,Sharon,"All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?
"
12,3,Gerald,"I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.
"
12,3,Stephen,"Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!
"
12,3,Gerald,"With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!
"
12,3,Randy,"Let's hear it for Gerald!
"
12,3,Stephen,"Hooray for Gerald! 
"
12,3,Ruby Tucker,"No! No!
"
12,3,Agent 1,"Oh wah wah! Get over it, druggie.  Jeez... 
"
12,3,Girl 2's Father,"Goodbye, Scrambles.  We'll miss you. 
"
12,3,Agent 2,"Got two here.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Hey! What the hell are you doing?!)
"
12,3,Agent 1,"Sorry, these are illegal.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(What?! No! What are you doing?!)  (You fuckers!) 
"
12,3,Cartman,"Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.
"
12,3,Kyle,"Guys, have you seen Kenny?
"
12,3,Stan,"Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.
"
12,3,Kyle,"Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
"
12,3,Butters,"Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
"
12,3,Stan,"Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Yeah, who has cats these days? 
"
12,3,Kyle,"Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)
"
12,3,Kyle,"Kenny? 
"
12,3,Stan,"Kenny, you home? 
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Wooooooooo! Woo! Wazzup? Wazzup?) 
"
12,3,Kyle,"Kenny!
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Wazzup? Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)
"
12,3,Butters,"Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 
"
12,3,"Stan, Kyle","Kenny!
"
12,3,Butters,"There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
"
12,3,Kyle,"Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(No we don't, guys.)
"
12,3,Stan,"Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)
"
12,3,Kyle,"Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
"
12,3,Butters,"Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
"
12,3,Stan,"Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)
"
12,3,Butters,"Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
"
12,3,Kyle,"We've gotta keep this away from him.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Mr. Kitty, shhh!  Damn it!  Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  What?!  It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty.  I'm in trouble enough as it is.  All right, all right, fine. 
"
12,3,Cartman,"All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. 
"
12,3,Sheila,"Huh?  Oh my God... 
"
12,3,Gerald,"Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?
"
12,3,Kyle,"Yeah?
"
12,3,Gerald,"Kyle, have you been getting high?!
"
12,3,Kyle,"No.
"
12,3,Gerald,"Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!
"
12,3,Kyle,"All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
"
12,3,Sheila,"Don't lie to us, Kyle!
"
12,3,Gerald,"How long have you been on the cheese?!
"
12,3,Kyle,"I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
"
12,3,Gerald,"Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
"
12,3,Kyle,"Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
"
12,3,Gerald,"Now, Kyle!
"
12,3,Kyle,"God! 
"
12,3,Sheila,"Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!
"
12,3,Gerald,"First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!
"
12,3,Sheila,"What are you gonna do?
"
12,3,Gerald,"I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. 
"
12,3,Gerald,"No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this.  I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat.  But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting.  I... I'll just do it one more time.  One. Last. Time.  Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat.  And then I'll never do it again.  After this one... last... time... 
"
12,3,Gerald,"I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
"
12,3,Cartman,"Who is it?!
"
12,3,Woman,"Please! Open the door.  They say you are hiding cats.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal. 
"
12,3,Woman,"You don't understand  My little Nishka,  She has nowhere else to go.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
"
12,3,Woman,"But they will find him.
"
12,3,Cartman,"I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
"
12,3,Woman,"Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. 
"
12,3,Cartman,"What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Woooooh! Woooooh!) 
"
12,3,Cartman,"Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.
"
12,3,Kyle,"Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 
"
12,3,Stan,"Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
"
12,3,Cartman,"He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.
"
12,3,Kyle,"What?
"
12,3,Stan,"He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
"
12,3,Kyle,"What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
"
12,3,Cartman,"They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! 
"
12,3,Stan,"Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.
"
12,3,Kyle,"I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
"
12,3,Gerald,"Hey everybody. Good to see you again. 
"
12,3,Father,"Hold! You cannot yet caress my daughter's awesome boobage!
"
12,3,Gerald,"Huh... how come?
"
12,3,Father,"There is... another suitor. 
"
12,3,Gerald,"What?  Get out of here, kid!
"
12,3,Kenny,"(No, fuck you! She's my girl!)
"
12,3,Gerald,"You're too young for this stuff!
"
12,3,Father,"This must be decided at the Breastriary in Nippopolis! 
"
12,3,Father,"Now fight for the Loc-Nar trophy! 
"
12,3,Kyle,"Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
"
12,3,Jimbo,"They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.
"
12,3,Gerald,"She's mine, you little asshole!
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Get the fuck off of me!)
"
12,3,Sheila,"Gerald?!
"
12,3,Reporter,"The key proponent of the cat ban has been charged with cheesing in a public park. Gerald Broflovski is prepared to give a public statement.
"
12,3,Gerald,"I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.
"
12,3,Sheila,"Don't touch me.
"
12,3,Gerald,"And to the people of South Park.  I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.
"
12,3,Stan,"What the hell is he talking about?
"
12,3,Kyle,"I have no idea.
"
12,3,Gerald,"And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.
"
12,3,Randy,"And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 
"
12,3,Gerald,"Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. 
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Yeah. I guess so.)
"
12,3,Gerald,"Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-
"
12,3,Stephen,"Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald.
"
12,3,Gerald,"The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! 
"
12,3,Girl 2's Father,"Scrambles! So good to have you back! You ain't sore at us, are ya?  Ahh! Get him off! 
"
12,3,Stan,"I'm sure glad that's over with. 
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
12,3,Cartman,"But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. 
"
12,3,Kyle,"And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
"
12,3,Cartman,"Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
"
12,3,Stan,"You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
"
12,3,Kyle,"Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life. 
"
12,3,Cartman,"Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
"
12,3,Kyle,"Kenny! 
"
12,3,Stan,"What the hell kind of flowers are those?
"
12,3,Kyle,"Kenny? Kenny?!
"
12,4,Mr. Mackey,"Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day.
"
12,4,Cartman,"Oh God, I'm bored already.
"
12,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, so we've been asked to show you a video from the World Canadian Bureau. Uh start the tape please? 
"
12,4,WCB President,"Hello, I am Stephen Abootman, President of the World Canadian Bureau. Do you ever stop to think how important Canada is to the world? Right now, I would like all students of Canadian descent in this school to stand up.  Just look at all these fine Canadians in your school. See how diverse they are. When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?
"
12,4,Cartman,"Gayness! 
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"That's right: spirit! What is it that makes Canada so important?
"
12,4,Craig,"Nothing! 
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"My fellow Canadians, for too long we have been pushed around, and ridiculed! Yesterday was supposed to be a day of appreciation and understanding! Instead, Canada Appreciation Day was mocked worldwide! 
"
12,4,Man 1,"Nobody takes us Canadians seriousleh!
"
12,4,Lumberjack,"It's like the world doesn't respect Canada at all, eh?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"That's right! And I think it's time for Canada to show the world just how bad things would be without it! Together we can send a message! It's time for Canada ...to strike!
"
12,4,Woman 1,"Did you say strike?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Yes! Every Canadian join me! Join together!
"
12,4,Man 2,"Canada, on strike.
"
12,4,Man 3,"Canada, on strike.
"
12,4,Canadians,"Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Caaanaaadaaa!
Canada on strike! Canada says ""No more!""
No more neglect! We want respect! That's what we're striking for!
All you bureaucrats and corporate cats
"
12,4,Border Guard,"Can all just take a hike! 
"
12,4,Canadians,"It's Canaada! On Strike!
Canada on strike! From Vancouver to St. John's ,
We raise our middle fingers for you all to sit upon!
And with our fingers up your ass,
you won't be very psyched
It's Canada! On Strike!
And we will not bow a bunch! Our resolve is strong!
We even took three hours to rehearse this striking song! 
Canada on strike! No matter where you are,
If you are Canadian then you've got to do your part!
March out of the halls!
"
12,4,Café 180 Patron,"That's right, suck my Canadian balls!
It's Canada! On Strike!
"
12,4,Canadians,"It's Canada! Canada! Canada! On Strike!
"
12,4,Swiss Delegate,"Ahhh, when you say ""Canada is on strike"", what exactly do you mean?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"What do you think it means?!  We're striking, buddih! No more! That's it! Until we get what we want
"
12,4,French Delegate,"Who exactly are you to authorize this strike?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"I'm Stephen Abootman! Leader of the WGA!
"
12,4,French Delegate,"The WGA?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Yes! The World Canadian Bureau! 
"
12,4,French Delegate,"What exactly does Canada want?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"We want: more... money!
"
12,4,Aide 1,"Yeah! More money!
"
12,4,Japanese Delegate,"More money from where?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Just more money! You know! Canada doesn't get enough money! Other countries have lots of money; we want, we want some of that money! Hu- how about- the Internet? The Internet makes lots of money! So give us some of that money!
"
12,4,Aide 1,"Yeah! Give us Internet money!
"
12,4,British Delegate,"A Mister A- Abootman, you seem to- not understand how ...global economics works. I think that-
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Don't give me that fat-cat fancy lip-wiggling! Are you gonna give Canada more money or not?! 
"
12,4,British Delegate,"I'm afraid we can't.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Then you leave Canada no choice.  This strike shall continue! 
"
12,4,Husband,"""Honk if you support Canada"" He- hey honey, watch this. 
"
12,4,Wife,"Oh, we're supporting unions.
"
12,4,Husband,"That's right; we're a very progressive couple.
"
12,4,Wife,"Yes.  Oh, that's fun!
"
12,4,Husband,"Well we've done our good deed for the week. I think now I can make love to your anus without making God angry.
"
12,4,Wife,"Oh really? Goodie! 
"
12,4,Kyle,"Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.
"
12,4,Cartman,"We don't care. *urp*
"
12,4,Kyle,"You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
"
12,4,Stan,"Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!
"
12,4,Butters,"Yippie!
"
12,4,Announcer,"It's the Terrance and Phillip Show.  Today's episode: I Fart Huckabees. 
"
12,4,Butters,"Aww, this one again?!
"
12,4,Stan,"God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!
"
12,4,Terrance,"Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.
"
12,4,Phillip,"Oh? Does it run on electricity?
"
12,4,Terrance,"No, it uses natural gas. 
"
12,4,Phillip,"Not as fat as your face!
"
12,4,Butters,"Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
"
12,4,Cartman,"God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
"
12,4,Kyle,"There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
"
12,4,Stan,"It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. 
"
12,4,Peter Griffin,"You think that's bad? Remember the time I sang ""La Cucaracha"" for Paul McCartney?
"
12,4,Cartman,"No! NOOO!
"
12,4,Peter Griffin,"La Cucaracha-  We are NOT... resorting to that!
"
12,4,Canadians,"We want more! We want more!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! 
"
12,4,Terrance,"Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Go home?! You can't leave the picket line!
"
12,4,Terrance,"But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Look, guy, we are to stay strong! If you don't stand with your fellow Canadians, then you are a rat!
"
12,4,Terrance,"Don't call me a rat, buddih!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your buddih, friend!
"
12,4,Phillip,"He's not your friend, guy!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your guy, buddih!
"
12,4,Terrance,"He's not your buddih, friend!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your friend, guy!  Don't you two understand anything?! You think striking is a joke?! You think it's something to ridicule?!
"
12,4,Weird Hat Guy,"Yah, you think this is funnih?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Don't you see that we have to stand together or else we have nothing?!
"
12,4,Aide 1,"Stephen! Stephen! A call came in from the United States! They want to talk to you aboot ending the strike!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"What did I tell you?! I told you we'd get to them sooner or later!  Shh, shh, quiet everyone! Let me handle this.  Yes. This is Stephen Abootman, head of the WGA.
"
12,4,Kyle,"Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Oh you do, huh?!  They've had enough. They want us to end the strike.  Quiet, quiet, shh, shh, sh- quiet, quiet! Let me deal with this.  All right, we're prepared to end this strike! If you are agreeing that we should have more monihhh!
"
12,4,Kyle,"We totally think you should have more money.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Wwe got 'em! We did it!  All right, how much are you gonna give us?
"
12,4,Kyle,"Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?!
"
12,4,Kyle,"The Internet?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"You listen to me, friend!  You'd better figure out a way to get us our fair amount of money, and until you come back with a solid fair number, I'm finished talking to you, you slimy corporate dickhead!  Don't worry, don't worry. This is how negotiating works. This is good. We've got 'em by the balls.
"
12,4,Stan,"What'd they say?
"
12,4,Kyle,"They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
"
12,4,Cartman,"How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
"
12,4,Butters,"Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
"
12,4,Kyle,"We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
"
12,4,Cartman,"Wait. I've got it.
"
12,4,Butters,"I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt 
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? 
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
It's okay
Ih-if you have a little fight
Don't you worry
I won't bite (Not that hard)
If you want it
I'll give you power
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower
Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please
"
12,4,A Nun,"Oh my.
"
12,4,Butters,"I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
"
12,4,Cartman,"There's more people viewing it!
"
12,4,Stan,"This is going great!
"
12,4,Kyle,"Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 
"
12,4,Tom,"And in other world news, the leader of Japan today is calling for an increase in military spending.
"
12,4,Aide 1,"How come they never mention anything about us?! When are they gonna get to the strike?!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Don't worry, the strike is big news. I'm sure it will be one of the top stories.
"
12,4,Tom,"In other news tonight, it the Internet video that has already seen over ten million views. A young confused-looking boy dancing and singing a song called ""What What (In My Asshole)"".
"
12,4,Reporter,"Tom, in just one week the video has become the most watched thing in all of America.  The boy in the video, referred to by most as ""that little gay kid"",  has already been asked to appear on Jimmy Kimmel and The Today Show.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Aw damn it that's not news! What about us?!
"
12,4,Phillip,"Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"We'll win! We'll just have to stay resilient!
"
12,4,Phillip,"Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.
"
12,4,Terrance,"Yeah, let's give it up, guy.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Don't call me your guy! I'm not your guy, friend!
"
12,4,Terrance,"Well I'm not your friend, buddih!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Well I'm not your buddih, guy!
"
12,4,Woman 2,"Wait! Here it is! Turn it up! We're on!
"
12,4,Tom,"And finally tonight, a new development in the Canada strike. For those of you who don't remember or don't care, Canada has been striking for more money. 
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"All right! Shh! I told you, I told you, listen, listensh, listen listen listen.
"
12,4,Tom,"In a shocking turn of events, it now appears that thousands of people from Denmark are flooding into the United States with hopes of taking the place of the striking Canadians.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"What?
"
12,4,Female Reporter,"Do you really think you Danish can replace the Canadians?
"
12,4,Danish Man,"Well, where we come from it's pretty cold too, ja. We like hockey and nobody really pays any attention to us.
"
12,4,Danish Woman,"Nobody knows where Denmark is.
"
12,4,Danish Man,"Right. So when you think about it, we're the Canadians of Europe.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"SCABS! How could you?! 
"
12,4,Stan,"Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
"
12,4,Clerk,"Take a number and wait with everyone else.
"
12,4,Cartman,"Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
"
12,4,Clerk,"Take a number and wait with everyone else! 
"
12,4,Black Man,"Chocolate Raaain.
"
12,4,Butters,"Aaah. 
"
12,4,Tron Guy,"Hey, I know you. You're the ""What What (In My Asshole)"" kid.
"
12,4,Butters,"""What What (In The Butt),"" sir.
"
12,4,Stan,"It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
"
12,4,Tron Guy,"Yeah, sure. All the biggest Internet stars are here. You remember, of course, Numa Numa. 
"
12,4,Numa Numa,"Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyaho, Ma-iyaha ha
"
12,4,Tron Guy,"And the Star Wars kid.  And the Internet sensation Cute Sneezing Panda.  And there's Dramatic Look Gopher. 
"
12,4,Cartman,"Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
"
12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"So, how many people have seen your Internet video?
"
12,4,Butters,"Uhhh a few hundred thousand?
"
12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"Huh, mere peanuts. Chocolate Rain has done gangbusters. Theoretically, I'm a millionaire.
"
12,4,Cartman,"Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
"
12,4,Chris Crocker,"Leave Chocolate Rain Guy alone! Leave him alohohone! I'm serious! 
"
12,4,Kyle,"Excuse me.  Hello?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"You greedy corporate fat cat. You said you would get us moneh.
"
12,4,Kyle,"Wait we're working on it.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"You're stalling! Because you think I'll give up. You know that most Canadians are talkin' about giving up the strike already.  You've got me over a barrel and you know it!
"
12,4,Kyle,"Sir, we're doing everything we can.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"You want me to say it again?! You've got me over a barrel! There, you happy?! You've got me bent over a barrel with my tender ass just waiting to be pulverized by your thrusting manhood!  Do you realize how stupid I'm going to look if I call off the strike after starting all this?! I won't do it! You hear me, guy?! You're wrong! No matter what happens I will never call of this strike! Even if it means we all. Die.
"
12,4,Kyle,"We don't want you to die.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Then you'd better hurry. We don't have much longer. The blood will be on your hands. 
"
12,4,Kyle,"We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
"
12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"I don't think so. Nothing takes priority over Chocolate Rain.
"
12,4,Star Wars Kid,"Oh, here he goes with the ego again. Who crowned you the top Internet star?!
"
12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"I did. When I became bigger than all you bitches.
"
12,4,Tron Guy,"Oh please, Laughing Baby had four times as many views as you! 
"
12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"You'd better shut your fuckin' mouth, Laughin' Baby!
"
12,4,Afro Ninja,"Did you all forget about Afro Ninja? My Internet thing was bigger than anybody's. I made over a hundred million theoretical dollars.
"
12,4,Star Wars Kid,"Well Sneezing Panda is theoretically worth billions!
"
12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"You all wanna motherfuckin' die?! 
"
12,4,Chris Crocker,"NOOO! 
"
12,4,Numa Numa Guy,"Haw!
"
12,4,Kyle,"Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.
"
12,4,Tron Guy,"Hai Hayaaa!
"
12,4,Numa Numa,"Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyah- 
"
12,4,Chris Crocker,"Leave Tron Guy alone! Leave him alone! 
"
12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"Get ready for some chocolate pain, bitch! 
"
12,4,Chris Crocker,"Leave the panda alone! Leave her alone, I'm serious! 
"
12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"Thought I forgot about you, Gopher?!  Ughhh, my brains. 
"
12,4,Cartman,"Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
"
12,4,Aide 1,"Stephen!, Stephen! They're here! They've come to negotiate!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"What?! You mean it?! 
"
12,4,Kyle,"Okay, we did it.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Who the hell are you?
"
12,4,Stan,"We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
"
12,4,Kyle,"Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Theoretical dollars? What am I supposed to do with that?!  You little timewasters!
"
12,4,Stan,"Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
"
12,4,Kyle,"Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
"
12,4,Cartman,"...You are a homo, Butters.
"
12,4,Kyle,"Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Nooooo! I'm not gonna look like an idiot! If I fucked up and led everyone astray, the last thing I'm going to do and admit it!  Yes, this is the head of the WGA. The World Canadian Bureau.
"
12,4,Swiss Delegate,"Ah, Mr. Abootman. It's the global world summit leaders. We want to talk to you about the strike.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"You... You do? You wanna negotiate?!
"
12,4,French Delegate,"No, actually we were just wondering if, when you're all dead, we can use Newfoundland for a new global theme park. 
"
12,4,Kyle,"Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
"
12,4,Swiss Delegate,"Excuse me?
"
12,4,Kyle,"He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
"
12,4,French Delegate,"Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize
"
12,4,Kyle,"If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Will they... act like they're giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?
"
12,4,Kyle,"Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
"
12,4,Swiss Delegate,"Sure, why not?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"We have won! 
"
12,4,Lumberjack,"Well how much did we get?
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Well, we uh, we didn't get everything that we wanted, but... we negotiated hard and... we got these...  coupons to Bennigan's! And...  free bubblegum... for every Canadian.  These coupons entitle every Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan's. With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course.
"
12,4,Aide 1,"We did it! 
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history. 
"
12,4,Kyle,"Ike. Ike!  It's over.
"
12,4,Ike,"It's over?
"
12,4,Kyle,"Yeah. Here you go. 
"
12,4,Stan,"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
12,4,Butters,"Me too!
"
12,4,Kyle,"Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
"
12,4,Stan,"...Yeah.
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone! Woohoo! 
"
12,4,Terrance,"Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!
"
12,4,Phillip,"And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Don't look at that. Come on, friends, let's dance.
"
12,4,Phillip,"You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Damn it friends, don't you see? We won for future Canadians, guy. So the little guy doesn't get pushed around anymore. This was a victory for Canada's respect. 
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"Eh?! What do you think you're doing?!
"
12,4,Terrance,"We're setting you adrift, idiot!
"
12,4,Phillip,"Maybe you can go live with the Danish!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"You'll regret this day, friend!
"
12,4,Phillip,"I'm not your friend, buddih!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your buddih, guy!
"
12,4,Terrance,"He's not your guy, friend!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your friend, buddih!
"
12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"We're not your buddih, guy!
"
12,4,Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your guy, friend!
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"It's like, my whole life has just been one big screw-up, you know?  I admit it, I was I was sexually lost. I was, and then I see this person on Oprah. She was a woman but then she got a sex change, became a man, but... then she got pregnant and is having a baby, which means she's still a woman all along. That means I'm really still a man, I'm... I still feel like a man
"
12,5,Butters,"Are we gonna get tested on this?
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"This sex change was a big mistake, okay?  I was on a lot of painkillers at the time and I thought it was what I wanted.
"
12,5,Stan,"Dude, wanna do some math problems?
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"And then, I go to the doctor, right? And I say ""Doctor, I wanna go back to being a man,"" and he says ""There's been too much damage. You can't go back. Where are you going to find a penis?""  Whattaya mean, where am I gonna find a penis?!  I'm a man! I deserve a God damned penis! 
"
12,5,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison!  Could we speak with you please?
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"What do you want? I'm trying to teach.
"
12,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, we think it's best you not teach until you get your personal life in order, m'kay? 
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Ohhh it's so easy for you, Mackey! You have a penis! 
"
12,5,Principal Victoria,"Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.
"
12,5,Principal Victoria,"Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? 
"
12,5,Cartman,"Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
"
12,5,Principal Victoria,"Any other volunteers, perhaps?
"
12,5,Cartman,"Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.
"
12,5,Principal Victoria,"All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Yes! 
"
12,5,Principal Victoria,"Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly.  Well well well. Who's teacher now?  Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!
"
12,5,Kyle,"You're not the teacher, fatass.
"
12,5,Cartman,"That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. 
"
12,5,News Anchor,"And so it appears that the local farmer's market could be soon facing complete closure. In other news tonight, a South Park bio company is coming under fire for genetically engineering body parts onto laboratory mice. This picture of a mouse  genetically altered to grow a human ear has already sparked waves of protest.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"What?
"
12,5,News Anchor,"But the scientists say the process could help thousands of people who've become disfigured and need ears or noses.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Holy Freaking Jesus.
"
12,5,Researcher 1,"Using common genetics and cartilage scaffolding, we can graft almost any body part onto a mouse and allow it to develop. Here's the mouse you saw on television.  Once the ear fully forms, it can be transplanted onto a person.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Doctor, what about a penis?
"
12,5,Researcher 1,"Well, a penis is something a man puts into a woman's vagina.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA, could you grow a penis on a mouse for me?
"
12,5,Researcher 1,"You don't understand: doing this stuff is very expensive. And we've never tried a penis before; there's no guarantee it would work.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"I will give you all the money I have to just try. Please. Doctor, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body. I need a penis.
"
12,5,Researcher 1,"All right.  All right, let's see what we can do.
"
12,5,Principal Victoria,"Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
"
12,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, ""commend"" means you've done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay?
"
12,5,Principal Victoria,"After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
"
12,5,Principal Victoria,"These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.
"
12,5,Board Rep 1,"Young man, word of your success as a student teacher has started the whole board thinking. We would like you to try your methods on one of our inner-city school classes.
"
12,5,Board Rep 2,"These kids just won't listen to any adult teachers and, since you handled your class so well, how would you like to give it a shot?
"
12,5,Cartman,"That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
"
12,5,Cartman,"Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
"
12,5,Kyle,"You're not an awesome teacher!
"
12,5,Cartman,"Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
"
12,5,Kyle,"The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
"
12,5,Cartman,"Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
"
12,5,Kyle,"Kenny's!
"
12,5,Kenny,"(Yeah, that was my idea.)
"
12,5,Cartman,"Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
"
12,5,Kyle,"Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 
"
12,5,Cartman,"Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
"
12,5,Principal,"Students, quiet! Quiet please!  Give me your attention!
"
12,5,Teen Boy 1,"I'll give you my attention. All night long, Mrs. Miller. 
"
12,5,Mrs. Miller,"You're on thin ice, Rodriguez! Now listen up! The Denver County School Board has sent over a special guest teacher.
"
12,5,Class,"Ohhhhhhhhhhh.
"
12,5,Mrs. Miller,"This may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez
"
12,5,Cartman,"Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.
"
12,5,Teen Boy 2,"What the hell is thiiis?
"
12,5,Cartman,"I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
"
12,5,Researcher 1,"Iii think you're going to be very pleased with the progress, Ms. Garrison.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Mr. Garrison! 
"
12,5,Researcher 1,"Sorry, Mister Garrison. Your DNA has replicated and grafted very successfully with the mouse. And so... here's your penis. 
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Wow! My penis looks great!
"
12,5,Researcher 1,"Yes. It's a fantastic penis. Congratulations.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"How long before it's ready?
"
12,5,Researcher 1,"Welll, it still has some forming to do, but fairly soon.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Let me see if it feels right in my hand. 
"
12,5,Researcher 1,"No! Don't open the- 
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Whoa no!
"
12,5,Researcher 2,"Don't let it get out of the lab! 
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Mah penis!  Stop, penis! Come back here!
"
12,5,Cartman,"Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
"
12,5,Teen Boy 3,"Hey man, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
"
12,5,Teen Boy 4,"Yeahhhh.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
"
12,5,Teen Boy 5,"Getting into college? Maaan, we ain't gettin' in no college! Fuck you! 
"
12,5,Cartman,"How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.
"
12,5,Teen Girl 1,"Hey, I don't wanna be called a cheater!
"
12,5,Cartman,"No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
"
12,5,Teen Boy 6,"This is bullshit. I don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Boys! Boys, have you seen my penis? 
"
12,5,Kyle,"What?
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"My penis is on the loose! If you see it, just try to catch it with some cheese. 
"
12,5,Butters,"Ow. That hurt my brains.  Oww.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Nice form, compadre. 
"
12,5,Teen Boy 6,"Hey, I walked out of your class, teacher. Look, I don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? 
"
12,5,Teen Boy 7,"Sure thing, Mr. C.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Okay, you start on defense, amigo. 
"
12,5,Teen Boy 6,"AAAAH! 
"
12,5,Cartman,"Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
"
12,5,Teen Boy 6,"You cheated!
"
12,5,Cartman,"What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. 
"
12,5,Teen Boy 6,"Fuck you, man, you can't do that!
"
12,5,Cartman,"Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. 
"
12,5,Teen Boy 6,"I know what you're trying to say, but I still don't agree with it. 
"
12,5,Cartman,"Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?
"
12,5,Linda,"What is that?  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Stephen! Stephen come quick!
"
12,5,Stephen,"What is it, dear?
"
12,5,Linda,"A penis is loose in our kitchen!
"
12,5,Stephen,"A penis?
"
12,5,Linda,"Yes! It just ran across the floor!
"
12,5,Stephen,"Now darling, calm down.
"
12,5,Linda,"Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!
"
12,5,Stephen,"Hoh, women. Always afraid of penises. 
"
12,5,Linda,"There! There, you see it?
"
12,5,Stephen,"Oh, it's just a little penis, darling.
"
12,5,Linda,"I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. 
"
12,5,Butters,"Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!
"
12,5,Stephen,"Your teacher's penis?
"
12,5,Butters,"Yeah, that must be his.
"
12,5,Stephen,"Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?
"
12,5,Butters,"Huh?
"
12,5,Cartman,"Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- 
"
12,5,Teen Boy 6,"I thought that... well maybe I can give cheating a try.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" Say it with me.
"
12,5,Class,"""I mis-interpreted the rules.""
"
12,5,Cartman,"Good. Again.
"
12,5,Class,"""I mis-interpreted the rules.""
"
12,5,Cartman,"Again!
"
12,5,Class,"""I mis-interpreted the rules.""
"
12,5,Cartman,"Now you sound like white people!
"
12,5,Class,"""I mis-interpreted the rules!""
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside?! Why didn't you call me?!
"
12,5,Stephen,"Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Well now how am I supposed to find it?! It could be anywhere!
"
12,5,A Woman,"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK! 
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Holy Crap! 
"
12,5,Woman,"Eeeek! Eeeeeek!
"
12,5,Husband,"Carole, get down from there!
"
12,5,Woman,"Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!
"
12,5,Husband,"I'm sure that penis is way more scared of you than you are of it.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"You saw a penis?!
"
12,5,Woman 2,"Eeeeeeeek! 
"
12,5,Woman 2,"Oh, it's so big and disguuusting. Eeek. 
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Come back here, penis!  There you are! Got you!  Hey, you're not my penis.  Ogh!  There it goes! Stop you!
"
12,5,Cartman,"The answer to #27 is 5.
"
12,5,Class,"The answer to #27 is 5.
"
12,5,Cartman,"The answer to #28 is 14.
"
12,5,Class,"""The answer to #28 is 14.""
"
12,5,Teen Girl 2,"Man, what's the point?  What's the point of any of this? 
"
12,5,Cartman,"All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?
"
12,5,Melita,"There isn't any point to all this. I won't be going to college. I'm pregnant, all right? I just found out, and Eduardo isn't going to help me raise it.
"
12,5,Cartman,"How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.
"
12,5,Melita,"No. I'm Catholic. I think abortion is wrong.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
"
12,5,Melita,"That cheating is good?
"
12,5,Cartman,"Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.
"
12,5,Melita,"I don't know, Mr. C.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
"
12,5,Sgt. Yates,"And the last time you saw your penis was two days ago? 
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"That's right.
"
12,5,Officer Harris,"Long whiskers or short?
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Short, and little fluffy ears.
"
12,5,Officer Harris,"Fluffy ears, okay.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Think you got it, Mitch?
"
12,5,Mitch Harris,"I think so, sir. Is this pretty close? 
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"No, no, not like that! That's just silly. 
"
12,5,Officer,"Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner.
"
12,5,Sgt. Yates,"What is it?
"
12,5,Officer,"Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Wall come on! 
"
12,5,Woman 2,"EEK!
"
12,5,Man 2,"What's the matter?
"
12,5,Woman 2,"A penis!
"
12,5,Woman 3,"A penis? Where?
"
12,5,Woman 4,"There it is!  Eek! 
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Where is it?!
"
12,5,Mitch Harris,"Look, there! 
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Come on! 
"
12,5,Chef,"What'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen? 
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"Huy! Don't you dare kill my penis!  Crap! We've gotta go back around!
"
12,5,Mouse,"Someone somewhere is loving me tonightLooking at the same moon and seeing it so bright.
"
12,5,Penis,"Someone somewhere is feelin' my despair
"
12,5,Mouse,"Feelin' my despair
"
12,5,Penis,"And this same moon is
"
12,5,"Penis, Mouse","making them think of that-.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"There it is!  No! Nooo!  No! No!
"
12,5,Mitch Harris,"There's not a chance now.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"No we, we can find it! 
"
12,5,Sgt. Yates,"Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone. Afraid there's nothing more we can do. You'll just have to live with being a woman. A very ugly one. Come on, men. 
"
12,5,Mrs. Miller,"Students, I want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores. The school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit.  The test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Uh what?
"
12,5,Mrs. Miller,"The test will be tomorrow. Make us proud. 
"
12,5,Teen Boy 8,"Monitor us in a private room?
"
12,5,Teen Boy 3,"Now they're gonna know we've been cheating all along.
"
12,5,Teen Boy 2,"I knew it man! You made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing!
"
12,5,Cartman,"Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
"
12,5,Teen Boy 8,"Shut up, man! You reyally screwed us all!
"
12,5,Cartman,"How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, ""Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."" You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.
"
12,5,Teen Girl 1,"Yeah, come on, we can do this, guys.
"
12,5,Cartman,"You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
"
12,5,Mrs. Garrison,"You did this to yourself, Garrison. Get your hopes up with a stupid genetic experiment and now all your money's gone along with your penis.  Well what the?  Why... it's my penis.  My penis came back. But why?  I guess it's true. What's that old saying? ""If you love your penis, let it go...""
"
12,5,Mrs. Miller,"The standardized advanced placement test is considered one of the most difficult and carefully monitored tests in the country. Twenty-four of our students took the test and all twenty-four scored 100% 
"
12,5,Teen Boy 6,"Uh, can we say something?
"
12,5,Mrs. Miller,"Sure. 
"
12,5,Teen Boy 6,"We would like to present this plaque to the person who taught us the White People Method. Mr. Cartmanez! 
"
12,5,Cartman,"I reeached these keeeds.
"
12,5,Principal Victoria,"Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison. 
"
12,5,Mr. Garrison,"Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend.  But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man.
"
12,5,A Teacher,"Whoa uh wait, uh, hang on a second. My wife had ovarian cancer, so she can't have babies.
"
12,5,Mr. Garrison,"Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!  Yeah! I'm back!
"
12,6,Sharon,"Get off the Internet, Stanley, it's time for bed.
"
12,6,Stan,"Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
"
12,6,Sharon,"Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!
"
12,6,Stan,"Aw man! 
"
12,6,Sharon,"Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime.
"
12,6,Shelly,"Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!
"
12,6,Sharon,"Now, Shelly! 
"
12,6,Shelly,"Why do you hate me?!
"
12,6,Sharon,"Randy, off the Internet.
"
12,6,Randy,"Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone.
"
12,6,Sharon,"No, mister, it's time for night-night.
"
12,6,Randy,"But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-
"
12,6,Sharon,"You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. 
"
12,6,Randy,"One more thing?  Ooooyeah... 
"
12,6,Stan,"What the hell?
"
12,6,Randy,"Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! 
"
12,6,Stan,"What?
"
12,6,Randy,"My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?
"
12,6,Stan,"My Internet's not working either.
"
12,6,Randy,"What?! 
"
12,6,Shelly,"Dad, the Internet's not working!
"
12,6,Randy,"I know that, okay?!
"
12,6,Shelly,"I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
"
12,6,Sharon,"Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.
"
12,6,Randy,"Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. 
"
12,6,Randy,"Gerald. Please help us.
"
12,6,Gerald,"Randy. What happened?
"
12,6,Randy,"Our house... It has no Internet.
"
12,6,Sheila,"Oh my God.
"
12,6,Randy,"We've got nothing! It's just gone.
"
12,6,Gerald,"Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
"
12,6,Randy,"Thank you Gerald. 
"
12,6,Stan,"I'm getting on it first.
"
12,6,Randy,"Oh no you're not!
"
12,6,Stan,"Kyle, I need to use your Internet
"
12,6,Kyle,"Ih it's not working.
"
12,6,Randy,"What?!
"
12,6,Kyle,"I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
"
12,6,Gerald,"No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.
"
12,6,Randy,"It's not working, Gerald.
"
12,6,Gerald,"But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
"
12,6,Randy,"Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!
"
12,6,Kyle,"I have to get online before school.
"
12,6,Stan,"What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.
"
12,6,Randy,"Right, Starbucks!
"
12,6,Gerald,"Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
"
12,6,Stephen,"Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?
"
12,6,Randy,"No! Nobody's is!
"
12,6,Man 1,"Whaaaaat's haaappeniiiiing?!
"
12,6,Randy,"Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
"
12,6,Gerald,"Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. 
"
12,6,Randy,"God, the whole neighborhood's affected. 
"
12,6,Gerald,"Get out of the way, Peterson! 
"
12,6,Clerk,"Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya.
"
12,6,Kyle,"It's not working here?
"
12,6,Randy,"Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.
"
12,6,Man 2,"No, don't. You're wasting your time.
"
12,6,Randy,"How do you know?!
"
12,6,Man 2,"Because we just came from there! There was nothing! Not one scrap of Internet!
"
12,6,Gerald,"How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
"
12,6,Stephen,"Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report.
"
12,6,Randy,"Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!
"
12,6,Mr. Garrison,"There has to be a way to find out what's going on.
"
12,6,Gerald,"We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
"
12,6,Man 3,"What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?
"
12,6,Randy,"A television! 
"
12,6,Anchorman,"Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news. It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4. We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back.
"
12,6,Randy,"Jesus, it's statewide.
"
12,6,Gerald,"It could be nationwide.
"
12,6,Anchorman,"Hello? Do you have Internet? It it's Channel 4 News. No, we don't have Internet either. 
"
12,6,Gerald,"No Internet... anywhere...
"
12,6,Randy,"Jesus... we're all alone... 
"
12,6,Sharon,"What's the matter?
"
12,6,Randy,"I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. 
"
12,6,Shelly,"What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead.  If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! 
"
12,6,Randy,"Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!
"
12,6,Stan,"Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
"
12,6,Randy,"You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
"
12,6,Gerald,"Randy, where will you go?
"
12,6,Randy,"We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
"
12,6,Gerald,"You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
"
12,6,Randy,"Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!
"
12,6,Stephen,"It could come back.
"
12,6,Randy,"Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go.
"
12,6,Stephen,"Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?
"
12,6,Randy,"How. You won't have Internet. 
"
12,6,Motel Clerk,"Sorry folks, we're full up.
"
12,6,Randy,"Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
"
12,6,Motel Clerk,"You and everyone else. You'll have to stay out at the transient camp with all the others heading to Californee.  It's about a mile down the road.
"
12,6,Randy,"I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. 
"
12,6,Transient Man 1,"Where are you from, old-timer?
"
12,6,Old-Timer,"Kansas City. Had me a store there. Kind of... computer supply store. When the Internet went, the stores went too.
"
12,6,Transient Man 2,"Things will be different when we get out to Californee. Soon as we get us some Internet we can all rest easy.
"
12,6,Transient Man 3,"Why sure, Silicon Valley. They gots a whole mess of Internet up there. 'Say a man can practically roll around in it.
"
12,6,Transient Man 4,"When I get to that Internet I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight. 'Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it.
"
12,6,Transient Man 1,"Well I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just stahrt e-mailin'. Just keep on e-mailin' till my fingers are sore to the bone.
"
12,6,Randy,"Sure will be nice. 
"
12,6,Transient Man 5,"You folks all headin' to Silicon Valley?
"
12,6,Randy,"That's right. We need to get online.
"
12,6,Transient Man 5,"Haha. ""Get online"" he says.
"
12,6,Stan,"What's so funny about that?
"
12,6,Transient Man 5,"Think about it. How many folk headin' out to Californee? A million? More? And how much Internet you think they got out there?  Might be some Internet, sure, but with everyone tryin' to use it at once, it's gonna go real slow-like. I knows it 'cause I seen it. My two children, they tried to load a Web page. Took them over three days. They sat there waitin', and by the time the loadin' bar was only half-full they was dead.  Starve on the Internet, with a belly stuck out like a big bladder... 
"
12,6,Randy,"Come on, Stan, let's get some rest. 
"
12,6,Shelly,"Amiiir... I miss you so much...
"
12,6,Stan,"Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 
"
12,6,Randy,"Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 
"
12,6,Worker,"Name?
"
12,6,Randy,"Do they have Internet here?
"
12,6,Worker,"Name?
"
12,6,Randy,"Marsh.
"
12,6,Worker,"Service provider?
"
12,6,Randy,"NetZero.
"
12,6,Worker,"All right, stay in line.  Once you're inside, Red Cross volunteers will direct you to your campsite.
"
12,6,Randy,"So is there Internet here?
"
12,6,Worker 2,"Stay in line and get to your campsite. 
"
12,6,Randy,"Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.
"
12,6,Refugee Man 1,"Yeah, they've got it here. 
"
12,6,Stan,"All right!
"
12,6,Refugee Man 2,"But there ain't enough to go around. All they got is a little Internet.  Barely a bar a signal. So they have to ration it out, carefully.
"
12,6,Refugee Man 3,"Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name. Each family gets 40 seconds o' Internet per day.
"
12,6,Randy,"Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
"
12,6,Volunteer 1,"Well it's all we got, so we gotta make do.
"
12,6,Refugee Man 4,"Look, honey, we ordered us some books on Amazon.
"
12,6,Volunteer 2,"All right, time's up.
"
12,6,Refugee Man 4,"No! No wait! I haven't entered the shipping information!  NO! NOO!
"
12,6,Volunteer 2,"Next? Brady, John H.
"
12,6,Randy,"Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? 
"
12,6,Sharon,"What did you say?
"
12,6,Randy,"Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.
"
12,6,Anchorman,"And that's about all we know. Uhh, there might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here. 
"
12,6,Anchorman 2,"A fax! A fax is coming through! 
"
12,6,Anchorman,"Oh yeah, a fax!!
"
12,6,Anchorman 2,"Oh a fax!
"
12,6,Anchorman,"It's a fax, it's a fax! It's a fax, it's a fax!
"
12,6,Anchorman 2,"It's a fax, we got a fax!  Uh-
"
12,6,Anchorman,"Oh! it says, ""The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it.""
"
12,6,Anchorman 2,"We've gotta send a reporter out to the Internet!
"
12,6,Kyle,"Where... is... the Internet?
"
12,6,General,"Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working.
"
12,6,Scientist 1,"We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly.
"
12,6,General,"Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!
"
12,6,Scientist 2,"Here it is, general. The Internet. 
"
12,6,General,"What's wrong with it?
"
12,6,Scientist 2,"See that flashing orange light in the middle? It's supposed to be solid green.
"
12,6,General,"My God.
"
12,6,Transient Man 6,"Hahaha, thedancingkitty.com, heh, wum, I wonder what that is, hum?  ""Click on the dancing kitty and you could win a prize!"" hoh, ahaha, ha.
"
12,6,Volunteer 2,"All right, time's up.
"
12,6,Refugee Man 5,"No, wait, I I just clicked on the kitty. I got it.  No! It wasn't long enough! NOO!
"
12,6,Volunteer 2,"Next? Nelson, Peter T.
"
12,6,Randy,"Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.
"
12,6,Volunteer 3,"Look, we're just tryin' to get by here. Everyone's gotta take what they can get.
"
12,6,Randy,"I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
"
12,6,Volunteer 3,"So jack off.
"
12,6,Randy,"You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!
"
12,6,Volunteer 3,"What do you want us to do? Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?!
"
12,6,Randy,"Three minutes would be plenty.
"
12,6,Volunteer 3,"Get lost! 
"
12,6,Randy,"Ohhh.
"
12,6,Sharon,"All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.
"
12,6,Shelly,"What number are you, turd?
"
12,6,Stan,"Eight fifty one.
"
12,6,Shelly,"You're nine twenty three now.
"
12,6,Stan,"Hey! Mom!
"
12,6,Sharon,"Shelly, give your brother his ticket back!
"
12,6,Shelly,"Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! 
"
12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Psst. Hey! Over here!  You... happen to be looking for Internet porn?
"
12,6,Randy,"Yeah, how'd you know?
"
12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Lots of us fellas came here for that reason. We all got used to seein' lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy.
"
12,6,Randy,"I know, right?
"
12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Anyway, we got us a simulator. You just call out what you wanna see and then say ""click"".
"
12,6,Randy,"""Internet Porn Simulator"" 
"
12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Give it a try. 
"
12,6,Randy,"Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!  Damn it.  Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click.  Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.  Bestiality? Click, click on that.  Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click!  Dahya.  No. No, this isn't gonna work.  It's just not the same.
"
12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Well, sorry. And that'll be $49 on your credit card.
"
12,6,Randy,"Well at least that part's like the Internet.
"
12,6,Anchorman,"We, we now have a reporter on the scene. Uhl-let's go live!
"
12,6,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again.
"
12,6,General,"All right, Internet. What do you want from us?   If we've angered you somehow, let us know.  Try to communicate with it digitally again.  I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it! 
"
12,6,Kyle,"Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...
"
12,6,Gerald,"What is it, Kyle?
"
12,6,Kyle,"I think... I know what's wrong.
"
12,6,Shelly,"This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!
"
12,6,Stan,"It's gotta be our turn soon.
"
12,6,Volunteer 2,"All right, folks, it's bed time. No more Internet for today.
"
12,6,Refugees,"AWWW!!! 
"
12,6,Woman,"A little closer!
"
12,6,Volunteer 2,"No, no, we're locking it away until tomorrow.  Everyone get to bed!
"
12,6,Refugees,"Aw man! 
"
12,6,Woman,"Wha?!
"
12,6,Shelly,"Gggggyyaaah! 
"
12,6,Randy,"Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. 
"
12,6,Girl 1,"Haro Kiti kawaii n desho? 
"
12,6,Girl 2,"Un. Choukawaii yo ne! 
"
12,6,Randy,"Oh niice... Whoa... 
"
12,6,Girl 1,"Watashi wa... daisuki! 
"
12,6,Randy,"Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! 
"
12,6,Refugee Man 2,"What is that?
"
12,6,Refugee Man 4,"Sounds like someone's bein' attacked by a tiger.
"
12,6,Randy,"Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!
"
12,6,Volunteer 4,"Get the keys! We gotta get in there. 
"
12,6,Randy,"Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! 
"
12,6,Volunteer 2,"What the...? 
"
12,6,Stan,"Dad?
"
12,6,Sharon,"Randy!
"
12,6,Randy,"Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!
"
12,6,Volunteer 2,"You son of a bitch!
"
12,6,Randy,"Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! 
"
12,6,Field Reporter,"This is our last chance. With nowhere else to turn, the government is going to allow one brave nine-year-old boy  to attempt his method to get the Internet running again.  It all comes down to this. Can the little Jewish boy reason with the Internet? Or will it be gone forever?
"
12,6,Scientist 1,"All clear for procedure.
"
12,6,General,"All right! Let's do it! 
"
12,6,Scientist 2,"Look! The flashing yellow light is steady green now!
"
12,6,Scientist 1,"He did it!
"
12,6,Scientist 3,"I've got Internet!
"
12,6,Scientist 4,"Me too!
"
12,6,Scientist 5,"Internet activity in all sectors, sir. 
"
12,6,Transient Man 5,"I've got Internet.
"
12,6,Transient Man 6,"Me too!
"
12,6,Transient Man 3,"It's back! 
"
12,6,Anchorman,"It's back? It's back! 
"
12,6,Shelly,"It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now! 
"
12,6,Amir,"Shelly. Shelly Marsh? 
"
12,6,Shelly,"What?
"
12,6,Amir,"It's me. Amir.
"
12,6,Shelly,"O... kay.
"
12,6,Amir,"Your family came here too, huh?
"
12,6,Shelly,"Yeah. 
"
12,6,Amir,"So uhhh, I guess I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back home.
"
12,6,Shelly,"Yeah, okay. Sounds good.
"
12,6,Amir,"Okay, s-see ya. 
"
12,6,Shelly,"We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther!
"
12,6,Randy,"And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. 
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul. 
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Hi, kids, and welcome to my village. I settled here in 1864 with my mahr and pahr. Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange clothes like you all are wearin'. And what's that fancy yellow horse carriage you got out there?
"
12,7,Stan,"Ughh.
"
12,7,Kyle,"This is gonna suck.
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"When you all are ready just head up to the village. All the townfolk are there to answer yer questions. And welcome.  To 1864. Set 'em up!
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Let's be partners, Kenny.
"
12,7,Kenny,"(No, I'm partners with Craig) 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Okay.  Stan, let's be partners, dude. 
"
12,7,Stan,"Naw, I'm with Wendy.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
"
12,7,Kyle,"I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
"
12,7,Cartman,"Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, partner with Butters.
"
12,7,Cartman,"God damn it!
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Hold Butters' hand, Eric! 
"
12,7,Cartman,"That isn't necessary!
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!
"
12,7,Butters,"I understand. 
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"All right, let's head in. 
"
12,7,Cartman,"You can let go now, Butters.
"
12,7,Butters,"No.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters, come on!
"
12,7,Butters,"No! 
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff.  Keep track of your partner!
"
12,7,Smithy,"Why howdy partners.  I'm the town blacksmith. Are you folks settlers, or are you just trappers passin' through?
"
12,7,Stan,"Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
"
12,7,Wendy,"Thanks, Stan.
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"These folks sure are strange, Smithy. We ain't never seen them kind of fancy hats in our time, have we?
"
12,7,Kyle,"That guy is wearing a digital watch.
"
12,7,Smithy,"Oh jeez. 
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Damn it Chad!
"
12,7,Chad,"S-sorry, I'm sorry.
"
12,7,Gunsmith,"Why howdy, partners, I'm the town gunsmith. You see, in our time it's pretty violent. See them holes in the walls? That's so we can put rifles through to protect us from Injuns.
"
12,7,Cartman,"I wanna shoot an Indian.
"
12,7,Gunsmith,"Now some of you might wanna meet Abigail at the candle-makin' house. Or you can head over to the general store. 
"
12,7,Butters,"Do you see any Indians?
"
12,7,Cartman,"Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  ""Super... Phun Thyme.""  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
"
12,7,Butters,"Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
"
12,7,Butters,"Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Fine, then let go of my hand!
"
12,7,Butters,"Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
"
12,7,Butters,"I'm not lettin' go!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Fine, then you're comin' with me!
"
12,7,Butters,"No, Eric! 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters, let go God-damn it!
"
12,7,Butters,"No!  T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"This here is our general store. It's where I buy all my supplies an' sich.
"
12,7,Clerk,"Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.
"
12,7,Wendy,"Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then.
"
12,7,Clerk,"What do you mean ""back then""? Don't forget, it's 1864.
"
12,7,Kyle,"Right. Except for it really isn't.
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Wuh, sure it is. Just look around ye. 
"
12,7,Kyle,"What's that?
"
12,7,Stan,"Sounds like police sirens.
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"What's a si-rene? We ain't never heard of no sirene in 1864. 
"
12,7,Leader,"We lost them, we lost them!
"
12,7,Injured Man,"Damn pig cops!
"
12,7,Leader,"Close that gate! 
"
12,7,Wendy,"What's going on?
"
12,7,Stan,"I don't know. 
"
12,7,Leader,"Everyone down on the ground NOW!
"
12,7,Sheriff,"Wuh-whoa now, I'm Sheriff McLawdog. I settled here back in eighteen fif- 
"
12,7,Stan,"Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"A phone? Why, what's a phone? We ain't never hearda sich a thing.
"
12,7,Stan,"What?!
"
12,7,Kyle,"Come on, this is serious!
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Eh storehand, you ever heard of this fancy shmancy phone?
"
12,7,Clerk,"Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time.
"
12,7,Stan,"Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"If you mean the law, only law around here is town sheriff McLawdog. You see, 1864 is a time of growth and development in the Old West.
"
12,7,Stan,"This is not the time for that!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
"
12,7,Butters,"Well, that's your problem!
"
12,7,Cartman,"All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.
"
12,7,Butters,"Make that two! 
"
12,7,Cashier,"Aww, aren't you two cute holdin' hands. Are you special little buddies?
"
12,7,"Butters, Cartman","NO! 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
"
12,7,Butters,"We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! 
"
12,7,Wendy,"Over here. This looks like an office.
"
12,7,Kyle,"Here! Here's the phone! 
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Well, what a straaange contraption.
"
12,7,Wendy,"I can't get a dial tone. 
"
12,7,Kyle,"What's the number to dial out?
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Dial out? Partner, them are some funny words you're usin'.
"
12,7,Stan,"Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! 
"
12,7,Clerk,"Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Brresh! 
"
12,7,Clerk,"Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time.
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"I'll say.
"
12,7,Kyle,"I got through. Hello, police?
"
12,7,Operator,"Nine one one, what's your emergency?
"
12,7,Kyle,"There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
"
12,7,Operator,"Taken hostage where?
"
12,7,Kyle,"The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
"
12,7,Operator,"You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?
"
12,7,Kyle,"Sister, you don't know the half of it.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice. 
"
12,7,Butters,"What are you whoofelin' at? 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!
"
12,7,Butters,"Whoa! 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Yeheah, we're wired up!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! 
"
12,7,Butters,"Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Aw, just a few more things.
"
12,7,Butters,"No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. 
"
12,7,Leader,"Set up the satellite relay, check for alternate routes out of the area.  Unfortunately, your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us. That is unfortunate for you, because when I think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination.
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. 
"
12,7,Blond,"How did they find us?!
"
12,7,Leader,"Get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building. 
"
12,7,Police Chief,"All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage.
"
12,7,Lieutenant,"Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter!
"
12,7,Police Chief,"Everyone stay on your toes! These are professionals we're dealing with here!
"
12,7,Officer,"What did they rob, sir?
"
12,7,Police Chief,"A Burger King.
"
12,7,Leader,"All right, good. Is that all of it? 
"
12,7,Balding Man,"No. Don't forget we've got these too.
"
12,7,Leader,"Excellent. Now listen, everyone, we're going to be all right. This is only a small hitch in our plan.  I'd like to speak with the chief of police!  Who is this? This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!
"
12,7,Kyle,"Why aren't the cops coming in?
"
12,7,Wendy,"They must be negotiating.
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots.
"
12,7,Kyle,"Will you shut up!
"
12,7,Stan,"Wait, you have guns here?
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Sure. Sheriff got lots of rifles in his office.
"
12,7,Stan,"Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"All righty. Come on, storehand.
"
12,7,Clerk,"Yeppir! 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
"
12,7,Butters,"We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
"
12,7,Butters,"Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.
"
12,7,Butters,"What?! They called the cops?!
"
12,7,Cartman,"They must have realized we left. Damn.
"
12,7,Butters,"Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Shhh! Butters!
"
12,7,Butters,"We're gonna get it now!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
"
12,7,Butters,"You just got me busted forever!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
"
12,7,Butters,"No! 
"
12,7,Cartman,"All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
"
12,7,Butters,"You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 
"
12,7,Cartman,"If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.
"
12,7,Butters,"No.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters?
"
12,7,Butters,"Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
"
12,7,Cartman,"All right, come on! 
"
12,7,Leader,"Keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts. Everyone check in at two-minute intervals. I hope you have good news, Ohrlich.
"
12,7,Ohrlich,"The police have us completely surrounded on all sides. There's no way we're gettin' out above ground without being spotted.
"
12,7,Leader,"Above ground?
"
12,7,Ohrlich,"Look, I found this at the rear of the park. It's an old mine shaft,  but Pioneer Village was sued when a kid died in it, so they closed it down and protected it with a huge me'al door with a coded lock.
"
12,7,Leader,"So if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police. Excellent.
"
12,7,Ohrlich,"One more thing, Frans: I want my share of the take now.
"
12,7,Frans,"What's the matter, Ohrlich? Lose your sense of trust?
"
12,7,Ohrlich,"I was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel. Then you take the loot to Berlin and I never see you again. I want my cut.
"
12,7,Frans,"Very well. 
"
12,7,Frans,"I'm going to ask you again, what is the door code to the tunnel?!
"
12,7,Smithy,"I told you, mister, what would I know about a door code? I'm just a simple blacksmith. With my trusty forge I makes all the metalworks for the village.  OW.
"
12,7,Frans,"You are an employee here, that means you are required to know the door code for fire code reasons,  Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs!
"
12,7,Smithy,"Huh my name ain't Palmer, it's... Old Smithy. Hand we ain't never heard of no fire code, why, we gots to put fires out ourselves when the-  OW.
"
12,7,Frans,"That's it!  Tell me the code or you die!  One... two...
"
12,7,Smithy,"I...
"
12,7,Frans,"Yes?
"
12,7,Smithy,"I don't know nothin' about no fancy door code. I'm just a simple blacksmith. 
"
12,7,Craig,"These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. 
"
12,7,Worker,"No. Please. Don't hurt me.
"
12,7,Frans,"Give us the code to that door and we can leave!
"
12,7,Worker,"I've never heard of sss-something called a door code.  Please, can't you ask some other way?
"
12,7,Frans,"I don't have time for your stupid game! Tell me, or you die right now! 
"
12,7,Worker,"All right, all right! Look, it's just, it's just one of those... Jenkins home security locks. You press the top button and then, and then enter 5-2 
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"What he meant to say, kids, is that we ain't never heard o'no fancy door code 'cause in our time, we gots to rely on wood locks and sich.
"
12,7,Frans,"God damn it you people are fucking insane!
"
12,7,Kyle,"I don't believe it.
"
12,7,Frans,"Domino,  Walsky! Find out if there are any employees or students wandering about! Bring them here or shoot them! 
"
12,7,Wendy,"Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on! 
"
12,7,Jimmy,"Yeah.  We've gotta geh- ...geh... get the hell ...outta here f- f-hast fast. 
"
12,7,Officer,"Sector Bravo, no activity.
"
12,7,Butters,"Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
"
12,7,Butters,"That looks dangerous.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.
"
12,7,Butters,"Oh gosh in heaven.
"
12,7,Cartman,"It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.
"
12,7,Butters,"Whoa!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Save me!
"
12,7,Butters,"I'm gonna fall! 
"
12,7,Cartman,"... Oh dude, laaame.
"
12,7,Frans,"Frohlich, check in. Have you found any other employees?
"
12,7,Domino,"We found somebody. 
"
12,7,Walsky,"We found this guy in the jail of the sheriff's office.
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"You let out Murderin' Murphy?
"
12,7,Murderin' Murphy,"Y'are all gettin' it for puttin' me in that thar jail!
"
12,7,Frans,"Stop it! Stop your bad historical acting right now!
"
12,7,Woman,"Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.
"
12,7,Frans,"I am the fucking bad man! Do you get that?! Knock it off and give me the mine shaft access code!
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"You're just gonna have to kill us, mister, 'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all.
"
12,7,Frans,"I won't kill you if you don't tell me. I'll kill one of THEM! 
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Not me! Not me not me not me not me! 
"
12,7,Kenny,"(What? Hey, let go.)
"
12,7,Frans,"Do you want to see a child die?!
"
12,7,Kenny,"(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
"
12,7,Butters,"I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
"
12,7,Butters,"Huh... 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
"
12,7,Butters,"Let's do it!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Ready? Go! 
"
12,7,Frans,"What about you? Will you tell us the access code or do you want to see this kid die?!
"
12,7,Woman,"I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.
"
12,7,Frans,"God damn it!
"
12,7,Kyle,"Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!
"
12,7,Stan,"I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. 
"
12,7,Kyle,"Stan?
"
12,7,Wendy,"Where are you going, Stan?
"
12,7,Stan,"Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. 
"
12,7,Frans,"All right, that does it!  On the count of three this child dies! One! Two!
"
12,7,Kenny,"(God damn it, someone help me!)
"
12,7,Stan,"Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Ohhh, welcome, partner. 
"
12,7,Frans,"Wha-what are you doing?
"
12,7,Stan,"I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"That's right, Murderin' Murphy. He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa.
"
12,7,Murderin' Murphy,"They killed my pahr!
"
12,7,Stan,"I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Y-y-yeah, I understand that.
"
12,7,Clerk,"Finally, a fella that talks some sense.
"
12,7,Stan,"If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Oh, well uh, I reckon the easiest number to remember for any big safe door lock would be... 1864.
"
12,7,Clerk,"Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.
"
12,7,Frans,"Eighteen sixty four. Ohrlich, we have the door code! Start packing up! We'll take the hostages with us! 
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"No, you got your door code, let us go!
"
12,7,Walsky,"Copy that. What's the code, over. 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
"
12,7,Butters,"Yeah, it sure has.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
"
12,7,Butters,"Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
"
12,7,Cartman,"Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
"
12,7,Butters,"Been a hoot all right!
"
12,7,Walsky,"Get your hands behind your head!
"
12,7,Cartman,"What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
"
12,7,Walsky,"Shut up! Put your hands behind your head! Do it now!  Let go of each other!
"
12,7,Butters,"Huh uh.
"
12,7,Walsky,"Do what I tell you!
"
12,7,Butters,"Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
"
12,7,Walsky,"Let go or else I'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters.
"
12,7,Walsky,"Now!
"
12,7,Butters,"No! 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Jesus Christ! 
"
12,7,Butters,"AAAAH!
"
12,7,Cartman,"AAAAH! 
"
12,7,Frans,"Go! Go take care of it! I'll stay with the hostages! 
"
12,7,Stan,"Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
"
12,7,Murderin' Murphy,"Yeah.
"
12,7,Stan,"He done killed yer pahr.
"
12,7,Murderin' Murphy,"What?! Well I'll rip his head off! 
"
12,7,Officer 2,"We've got a chance. Hostages are clear! 
"
12,7,Frans,"They are coming in! 
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
12,7,Officer 3,"Whoa, no, no!
"
12,7,Officer 2,"Hostages are secure at the park entrance!
"
12,7,Murderin' Murphy,"I got you now, Pioneer Paul!
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"They shoulda never let you out of jail, Murderin' Murphy! 
"
12,7,Police Chief,"Freeze, scumbag! It's all over! 
"
12,7,Woman,"Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!
"
12,7,Officer 2,"Stop right now! It's over! 
"
12,7,PA System,"Howdy, partners. It's five o'clock. Pioneer Village is now closed for the day.  Head back to your wagons and have a safe trip home.
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"We made it!
"
12,7,Murderin' Murphy,"We made it! 
"
12,7,Woman 2,"Oh God, I can't wait to get out of this dress.
"
12,7,Murderin' Murphy,"Whoa, that was great! 
"
12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Uh, listen, if anyone still wants to know, the phone is in the administration building, you dial 9 to get out, and there's actually a back exit behind the horse troughs. Good night everybody, thanks for coming. We did it, guys!
"
12,7,Gunsmith,"Let's go to TGI Fridays and get some jalapeño poppers!
"
12,7,Murderin' Murphy,"Yeah, that'd be great!
"
12,7,Man 1,"All right!
"
12,7,Man 2,"Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeño poppers.
"
12,7,Man 3,"Let's go, huh.
"
12,7,Wendy,"Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.
"
12,7,Stan,"I know.
"
12,7,Police Chief,"Come on you!
"
12,7,Frans,"You're hurting my arm!
"
12,7,Police Chief,"Too bad! You'll be going away for a long time. Was it worth it?
"
12,7,Frans,"In a way, it was. I might not have gotten away, but... at least I learned a lot about Pioneer life in the Old West. Those early settlers didn't have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today. To think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin' as simple as washing your clothes. Pioneer Village has a lot to teach us all.
"
12,7,Police Chief,"That's true. 
"
12,7,Wendy,"Hey look. 
"
12,7,Butters,"Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 
"
12,8,Announcer,"Welcome to the televised broadcast of the Olympic Opening Ceremonies from Beijing.  Thousands of Chinese performers playing ancient Chinese drums.  The precision of their movements made even more impressive by their massive numbers. 
"
12,8,Cartman,"No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!
"
12,8,Liane,"Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?
"
12,8,Cartman,"They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!
"
12,8,Liane,"Sweetiekins, are you all right?
"
12,8,Cartman,"Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
"
12,8,Liane,"No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.
"
12,8,Cartman,"They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
"
12,8,Cartman,"All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?
"
12,8,Kyle,"I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
"
12,8,Stan,"Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
"
12,8,Kyle,"Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 
"
12,8,Kenny,"(Damn.)
"
12,8,Stan,"Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.
"
12,8,Kyle,"Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
"
12,8,Stan,"Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
"
12,8,Kyle,"Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!
"
12,8,Stan,"There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
"
12,8,Kyle,"Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
"
12,8,Stan,"How?
"
12,8,Kyle,"I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.
"
12,8,Stan,"You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
"
12,8,Kyle,"I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
"
12,8,Stan,"God damn it.
"
12,8,Butters,"Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
"
12,8,Cartman,"There you are, Butters!
"
12,8,Butters,"Uhuh, Eric.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Butters, I need your help.
"
12,8,Butters,"Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent.
"
12,8,Cartman,"The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
"
12,8,Butters,"The Chinese?
"
12,8,Cartman,"I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
"
12,8,Butters,"Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
"
12,8,Cartman,"You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
"
12,8,Butters,"Why are they gonna kill my parents?
"
12,8,Cartman,"Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?
"
12,8,Butters,"I don't want my parents to die.
"
12,8,Cartman,"So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!
"
12,8,Butters,"Well sure.
"
12,8,Cartman,"You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
"
12,8,Butters,"Yeah,  fuck 'em.
"
12,8,Kyle,"No... No!  No...
"
12,8,Kyle,"No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
"
12,8,Stan,"Let's get out of here!
"
12,8,Kyle,"We can't just leave!
"
12,8,Stan,"Come on!
"
12,8,Kyle,"Aw it's horrible! 
"
12,8,Stan,"Oh God!
"
12,8,Kyle,"Somebody do something!
"
12,8,Clyde,"Why are they doing this?!
"
12,8,Kyle,"They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 
"
12,8,Stan,"I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle! 
"
12,8,Kyle,"Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
"
12,8,Stan,"COME ON LET'S GO! 
"
12,8,Kyle,"WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
"
12,8,Stan,"JUST RUN!! 
"
12,8,Clyde,"Oh God, what have they done?!
"
12,8,Stan,"Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
"
12,8,Clyde,"Whyyy? Whyyy?? 
"
12,8,Jimmy,"We can't help him now.
"
12,8,Butters,"Well I thought it was pretty good.
"
12,8,Stan,"Let's just go, Let's just go! 
"
12,8,Kyle,"NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...
"
12,8,Cartman,"All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?
"
12,8,Butters,"I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
"
12,8,Cartman,"This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 
"
12,8,Butters,"But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
"
12,8,Cartman,"Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say ""herro"" and ""prease"" a lot.  ""Oh, herro prease."" Ping pong ching chong.
"
12,8,Butters,"Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.
"
12,8,Greeter,"Uhh welcome to P.F. Chang's. I'll be right with you. 
"
12,8,Butters,"Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
12,8,Butters,"What?
"
12,8,Cartman,"It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
"
12,8,Greeter,"Uh, can I help you?
"
12,8,Cartman,"Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.
"
12,8,Butters,"Herro prease. Ting tao ding ling.
"
12,8,Greeter,"Uh yeah, why don't I seat you over here?  Your waitress will be right with you.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?
"
12,8,Butters,"Yeah.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
"
12,8,Butters,"Stay calm, Eric.
"
12,8,Cartman,"They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.
"
12,8,Butters,"Herro, prease.
"
12,8,Cartman,"So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
"
12,8,Butters,"Fing fong ting tong.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Ting ton teetong.
"
12,8,Mother,"What are they doing?
"
12,8,Father,"I don't know.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. 
"
12,8,Stan,"Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.
"
12,8,Jimmy,"And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen.
"
12,8,Stan,"Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
"
12,8,Jimmy,"I thought I could go on like before. But after seeing Indiana get raped... After seeing Indiana get raped I know I'll never be the sa-a-ame, the same? The same.  Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator?  It didn't make any sense, Stan.
"
12,8,Stan,"I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 
"
12,8,Jimmy,"You can't run away from it forever,  Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow.
"
12,8,Stan,"Indiana Jones! All right! 
"
12,8,Indy,"Hey there, Stan. All set to see my new adventure?
"
12,8,Stan,"You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Well well hello there Indiana. 
"
12,8,Lucas,"You're looking cute. 
"
12,8,Stan,"No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! 
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Oh yeah! 
"
12,8,Indy,"No! 
"
12,8,Stan,"Indy! 
"
12,8,Lucas,"Yeah! Get down! Get back down! 
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Hold him, Lucas! Come on!
"
12,8,Lucas,"Heheh! He-he ain't goin' nowhere!
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Yeah!
"
12,8,Stan,"No, stop! Raape!
"
12,8,Indy,"HOOOOOOOOO! 
"
12,8,Cartman,"All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
"
12,8,Butters,"Okay, okay.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
"
12,8,Butters,"Huh, invasion pran.
"
12,8,Cartman,"What day is American invasion again? I fohget. 
"
12,8,Father,"'Scuse me, miss?
"
12,8,Greeter,"Yes sir?
"
12,8,Father,"These people won't leave us alone.
"
12,8,Cartman,"...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
"
12,8,Father,"You aren't Chinese.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Oh my God...
"
12,8,Butters,"We're busted! Uh what do we do??
"
12,8,Greeter,"Okay, why don't we go...
"
12,8,Cartman,"Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. 
"
12,8,Butters,"A gun?
"
12,8,Cartman,"Hold the gun on them Butters!
"
12,8,Butters,"I don't want a gun, Eric!
"
12,8,Cartman,"They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
"
12,8,Butters,"Oh jeez...
"
12,8,Cartman,"Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!
"
12,8,Patron,"This is stupid. I'm leaving!
"
12,8,Cartman,"Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
"
12,8,Patron,"Screw you!
"
12,8,Cartman,"Shoot him, Butters!
"
12,8,Butters,"No!
"
12,8,Cartman,"You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
"
12,8,Butters,"Waah! 
"
12,8,Patron,"Ow! A-Ah! A-Ooowww!
"
12,8,Cartman,"Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
"
12,8,Butters,"Huh?
"
12,8,Cartman,"That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
"
12,8,Butters,"But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
"
12,8,Cartman,"It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
"
12,8,Kyle,"My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
"
12,8,DA,"You want to bring Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to trial for raping Indiana Jones.
"
12,8,Kyle,"I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
"
12,8,Stan,"You aren't alone. 
"
12,8,Kyle,"Stan?
"
12,8,Stan,"We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.
"
12,8,Kyle,"I love you too.
"
12,8,DA,"Uh kids, kids, I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.
"
12,8,Stan,"Wh-why?
"
12,8,DA,"You don't have a case here. You can't really say that Spielberg and Lucas raped Indiana Jones in the new film.
"
12,8,Kyle,"Did you see it?
"
12,8,DA,"Yes I saw it, but I-  But I just try not to think about it.
"
12,8,Stan,"Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
"
12,8,DA,"I don't know what I saw!  All right?! I mean, it wa-it was dark in the theater... I mean... yeah, things got a little out of hand with the plot... the third act took too long, uh-
"
12,8,Kyle,"Indy deserved more than that!
"
12,8,DA,"GET OUT! JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!  No, no... 
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Well well, Indiana Jones.  You're looking nice. 
"
12,8,Indy,"Hey. Hey! 
"
12,8,Spielberg,"There you go, Lucas! Dick him!  He's gonna do it right there! All right! All right Georgie!
"
12,8,Lucas,"Grab his hands, heh. 
"
12,8,DA,"Hey leave him alone! 
"
12,8,Spielberg,"COME ON BIG GUY!
"
12,8,Indy,"NOOO! 
"
12,8,DA,"Nooo... Nohoho...  Waaait!  Wait I... want to help! 
"
12,8,Father,"Look, we don't know what you're talking about. There's no Chinese plan to take over America.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! 
"
12,8,Captain,"You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you.
"
12,8,Cartman,"No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
12,8,Butters,"Uhwhat?
"
12,8,Cartman,"One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
"
12,8,Officer,"The President?
"
12,8,Captain,"All right men, come on. We're going in.
"
12,8,Cartman,"No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! 
"
12,8,Chinese Officer,"Ow! Ah, o-ow! 
"
12,8,Cartman,"Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
"
12,8,Butters,"What? What happened? 
"
12,8,Cartman,"God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
"
12,8,Butters,"Aw, I did it again?
"
12,8,Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
"
12,8,Butters,"Well okay, I'm sorry!
"
12,8,Cartman,"...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!
"
12,8,DA,"It's all right there in front of you, Detective. Five sworn statements from these... brave boys. It's now up to you.
"
12,8,Det. Yates,"Are you nuts?! I'm not going out and arresting Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
"
12,8,Stan,"But they raped Indiana Jones!
"
12,8,Kyle,"I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
"
12,8,Det. Yates,"I didn't see it. 
"
12,8,Jimmy,"...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?
"
12,8,Det. Yates,"No! I don't think anybody here saw it. Did you, Mitch?  Mitch? Mitch? 
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Well well, Indiana Jones. What you doin' in our neck of the woods?  Now let's see you just drop them pants!
"
12,8,Indy,"Drop?
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Just take 'em right off.
"
12,8,Indy,"Uh what do you guys want?
"
12,8,Lucas,"Don't say anything, just do it. And pull off that little ol' biddy. The shirt there, too. 
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Them panties. Take 'em off.  There, boy! I bet you can squeal! I bet you can squeal like a pig!  Come on, squeal. Squeal now. Squ-squeal!  Weeee! Squeal.
"
12,8,Indy,"We-eee!
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Squeal louder. Weeee!
"
12,8,Indy,"Weee!
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Louder louder! Weeee!
"
12,8,Indy,"Weee!
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Louder! Get down there boy!  Get them britches down.
"
12,8,Indy,"No...
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Yes, sir! Come on, squeal! Weeeeee!
"
12,8,Indy,"Weee!
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Weeeeee!  Weeee!
"
12,8,Indy,"Hawwww! Hawwww! 
"
12,8,Kyle,"It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
"
12,8,Cartman,"No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!
"
12,8,Butters,"They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Good! Did you kill him? 
"
12,8,Butters,"Uh, not exactly.
"
12,8,SWAT Officer,"Ow. Oh, it stings. Ohhhh. 
"
12,8,Butters,"Well it's not where I aimed, honest.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Dude...
"
12,8,Butters,"I seriously didn't mean it.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 
"
12,8,Butters,"What? Uh where are you going, Eric?
"
12,8,Cartman,"You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
"
12,8,Butters,"By, by my, by myself?
"
12,8,Cartman,"I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
"
12,8,Captain,"Go inside! Move! 
"
12,8,Deputy 1,"George Lucas and Steven Spielberg! We have a warrant for your arrest!  Break it in! 
"
12,8,Deputy 2,"My God. 
"
12,8,Spielberg,"Heey, what, what the hell are you doin' here?!  You've got nothin' on us! Seven hundred million box office!
"
12,8,Lucas,"Hm this is bullshit!
"
12,8,Stormtrooper,"Weeee! Weeee!
"
12,8,Det. Yates,"Boys, we got 'em.
"
12,8,Kyle,"What?
"
12,8,Det. Yates,"Spielberg and Lucas, they were... raping a Stormtrooper when the police broke in.
"
12,8,Mitch,"And they found the dead raped bodies of Yoda and Short Round in their closet.  They'll never be free to do this again. 
"
12,8,Stan,"So, what now?
"
12,8,Jimmy,"Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this?
"
12,8,Clyde,"What do we do?
"
12,8,Kyle,"We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
"
12,8,Captain,"Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out.
"
12,8,Father,"There's nothing to sort out! These kids need to be put in jail!
"
12,8,Captain,"We're going to search everyone and get statements! And the-
"
12,8,Officer 1,"Sir! Sir, it's over. They got 'em.
"
12,8,Captain,"Got who?
"
12,8,Officer 1,"Spielberg and Lucas, they... finally got them for what they did to Indiana Jones, sir. 
"
12,8,Captain,"Hohhh, they got them.
"
12,8,Officer 2,"They got 'em. It's over.
"
12,8,Officer 3,"It's over. 
"
12,8,Father,"That means... they'll never be free to rape again.
"
12,8,Waiter,"It's over its over. 
"
12,8,Officer 4,"I love you.
"
12,8,Officer 5,"I love you too. 
"
12,8,Butters,"So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
"
12,8,Cartman,"I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 
"
12,8,Butters,"...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's all take our seats.  Before we get started today, Wendy Testaburger has asked to share something with the class. Wendy? 
"
12,9,Wendy,"Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- 
"
12,9,Cartman,"She said it again. 
"
12,9,Wendy,"Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, for the love of Jesus...
"
12,9,Wendy,"This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
"
12,9,Butters,"I don't wanna get killed by boobs.
"
12,9,Wendy,"Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, stop being offensive.
"
12,9,Cartman,"I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
"
12,9,Wendy,"No you aren't!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  ""Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!"" 
"
12,9,Wendy,"What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Not at all.  ""Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!""
"
12,9,Wendy,"You'd better shut up  or I'll make you shut up!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
"
12,9,Wendy,"I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?
"
12,9,Wendy,"That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!
"
12,9,Cartman,"You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
"
12,9,Wendy,"You think you're tough?
"
12,9,Cartman,"Whassup?  Whassup?
"
12,9,Wendy,"I'll smack the shit out of you!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
"
12,9,Wendy,"After school! We fight after school! You got that?!
"
12,9,Cartman,"You're gonna fight me after school?
"
12,9,Wendy,"That's right!
"
12,9,Cartman,"You're a chick, dude.
"
12,9,Wendy,"As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Oh, it's on, bitch!
"
12,9,Wendy,"You're gonna  fucking die! 
"
12,9,Butters,"Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
"
12,9,Stan,"What?
"
12,9,Bebe,"Wow.  Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!
"
12,9,Girls,"Really? Wow.
"
12,9,Ike,"Wendy and Cartman are fighting after school. 
"
12,9,Kindergartners,"Yaaay!
"
12,9,Red,"Hey emo kids, Cartman and Wendy are gonna fight after school. 
"
12,9,Pete,"Did she just call us emos?
"
12,9,Butters,"Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
"
12,9,Token,"She is pissed off.
"
12,9,Cartman,"She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
"
12,9,Clyde,"Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. 
"
12,9,Jimmy,"Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
"
12,9,Butters,"Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
"
12,9,Wendy,"What?!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-
"
12,9,Wendy,"What?
"
12,9,Cartman,"I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.
"
12,9,Wendy,"If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.
"
12,9,Wendy,"No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
"
12,9,Wendy,"Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
"
12,9,Wendy,"I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.
"
12,9,Wendy,"Get away from me! 
"
12,9,Michael,"So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend.
"
12,9,Stan,"I guess so.
"
12,9,Pete,"And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something? 
"
12,9,Michael,"Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends.
"
12,9,Stan,"What am I supposed to do about it? 
"
12,9,Craig,"Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off.
"
12,9,Jimmy,"I'll bet she is!
"
12,9,Butters,"Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy. Wendy psst.
"
12,9,Wendy,"What?!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
"
12,9,Wendy,"You really think that's gonna work on me?!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-
"
12,9,Wendy,"You can't bribe your way out of this!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.
"
12,9,Wendy,"No you don't.
"
12,9,Cartman,"My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
"
12,9,Wendy,"You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Eat my underwear?
"
12,9,Wendy,"That's right.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.
"
12,9,Wendy,"Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!
"
12,9,Cartman,"No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
"
12,9,Wendy,"You fucking suck so hard!!
"
12,9,Cartman,"I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.
"
12,9,Wendy,"What are you doing?! 
"
12,9,Cartman,"I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am... 
"
12,9,Wendy,"Ew! 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.
"
12,9,Wendy,"Oh my God!
"
12,9,Cartman,"So...  are we cool?
"
12,9,Wendy,"No!
"
12,9,Cartman,"I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-
"
12,9,Wendy,"You are so pathetic!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?
"
12,9,Cartman,"Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.
"
12,9,Stan,"What?
"
12,9,Cartman,"You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
"
12,9,Stan,"Yeah?
"
12,9,Cartman,"Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
"
12,9,Stan,"I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
"
12,9,Stan,"Really?
"
12,9,Cartman,"You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
"
12,9,Stan,"Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
"
12,9,Cartman,"God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle.  All right kids, for your homework tonight I want you all to read chapters seven... 
"
12,9,Bebe,"Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!
"
12,9,Jimmy,"As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight. 
"
12,9,Butters,"Almost time. 
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
"
12,9,Clyde,"I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Detention! That's it! 
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?
"
12,9,Cartman,"Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? 
"
12,9,Butters,"Huh.
"
12,9,Mr. Mackey,"Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Ahhh, sweet.
"
12,9,Butters,"Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
"
12,9,Cartman,"What?! That's ridiculous!
"
12,9,Butters,"But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
"
12,9,Cartman,"That's not why I did it.
"
12,9,Craig,"Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?
"
12,9,Cartman,"Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
"
12,9,Butters,"That's what I said. I told everyone outside, ""Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!""
"
12,9,Cartman,"Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
"
12,9,Craig,"Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow.
"
12,9,Jimmy,"Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Huh?
"
12,9,Butters,"That way it won't matter if you get detention.
"
12,9,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!
"
12,9,Jimmy,"Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ! 
"
12,9,Wendy,"Tomorrow morning! You fucking die tomorrow morning! 
"
12,9,Mrs. Testaburger,"Wendy?
"
12,9,Wendy,"Yeah?
"
12,9,Mrs. Testaburger,"We need to talk to you, right now.  Wendy, have you been bullying kids at school?
"
12,9,Wendy,"What? No!
"
12,9,Mrs. Testaburger,"Well, do you want to explain why this little boy's mother had to come talk to us? 
"
12,9,Mr. Testaburger,"Did you tell this little boy you were going to beat him up?!
"
12,9,Wendy,"You don't understand. He said horrible things.
"
12,9,Cartman,"The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. 
"
12,9,Mrs. Testaburger,"Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that?
"
12,9,Cartman,"The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 
"
12,9,Mrs. Testaburger,"Wendy, you tell this little boy you aren't going to hurt him!
"
12,9,Wendy,"Mom, you don't-
"
12,9,Mrs. Testaburger,"Now, young lady.
"
12,9,Wendy,"I'm not going to hurt you.
"
12,9,Mr. Testaburger,"If there is any word of you fighting at school it's over for you, missy! Do you understand?!
"
12,9,Wendy,"Yes sir.
"
12,9,Mr. Testaburger,"We're so sorry about this, Ms. Cartman.
"
12,9,Liane,"Oh no, thank you so much for your time. 
"
12,9,Mr. Testaburger,"It won't happen again.
"
12,9,Liane,"You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
"
12,9,Butters,"Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
"
12,9,Bebe,"Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?
"
12,9,An Older Girl,"Here she comes! 
"
12,9,Cartman,"What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
"
12,9,Wendy,"You know I can't fight you!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Why not? You chicken? 
"
12,9,Wendy,"I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
"
12,9,Butters,"Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
"
12,9,Cartman,"I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
"
12,9,Bebe,"Come on Wendy, kick his ass!
"
12,9,Wendy,"I can't!  God damn it!
"
12,9,Butters,"She chickened out!
"
12,9,Other students,"Aw man. 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Told you guys.
"
12,9,Stan,"Ugh, I'm glad that's over with.
"
12,9,Pete,"Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad.
"
12,9,Jimmy,"I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.
"
12,9,Clyde,"And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. 
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go?  Okay Eric. 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. 
"
12,9,Wendy,"You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.
"
12,9,Cartman,"What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"Okay Eric, that's enough you smartass!
"
12,9,Wendy,"Why?!  Why are you doing this to me?!  Why won't you just stop?!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy, Wendy.
"
12,9,Principal Victoria,"Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.
"
12,9,Wendy,"God! 
"
12,9,Principal Victoria,"Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman.
"
12,9,Wendy,"No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight.
"
12,9,Principal Victoria,"Oh no? Are you sure?
"
12,9,Wendy,"Yes ma'am!
"
12,9,Principal Victoria,"I see.  I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?
"
12,9,Wendy,"Ma'am?
"
12,9,Principal Victoria,"I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed.  When there is a cancer, you have to ""fight"" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you.
"
12,9,Wendy,"My... parents said that if I fight-
"
12,9,Principal Victoria,"And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you.  You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will  take everything. Do you understand?
"
12,9,Wendy,"Yes ma'am!
"
12,9,Principal Victoria,"When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!
"
12,9,Bebe,"She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!
"
12,9,Millie,"What? 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!
"
12,9,Butters,"She's coming! She's coming!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Butters, get out of here!
"
12,9,Butters,"But Wendy's coming to fight you.
"
12,9,Cartman,"...Huh? 
"
12,9,Clyde,"Oh boy here we go!
"
12,9,Butters,"All right! 
"
12,9,Pete,"It's about freaking time. 
"
12,9,Craig,"All right, let's DO IT!
"
12,9,Cartman,"What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
"
12,9,Wendy,"I don't care! 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
"
12,9,A Girl,"Shut up and fight! 
"
12,9,Cartman,"All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!
"
12,9,Kids,"Ohhhhh!
"
12,9,Butters,"Fuck him up, Wendy!
"
12,9,Mr. Mackey,"Wendy?
"
12,9,Wendy,"I'm finished! 
"
12,9,Mr. Mackey,"Eh somebod - somebody call the principal! 
"
12,9,Cartman,"You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. 
"
12,9,Stan,"Dude, we never thought you were cool.
"
12,9,Cartman,"That's not true. You're just saying that.
"
12,9,Kyle,"No, really. We've always thought you suck.
"
12,9,Jimmy,"Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.
"
12,9,Cartman,"You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
"
12,9,Craig,"No, it's true. We've always hated you.
"
12,9,Butters,"Well yeah.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. 
"
12,9,Craig,"What?
"
12,9,Cartman,"If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! 
"
12,10,Kyle,"I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)
"
12,10,Cartman,"Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
"
12,10,Kenny,"('Cause girls like shaved balls.)
"
12,10,Kyle,"Girls like shaved balls?
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Yes they do.)
"
12,10,Cartman,"What girl is gonna see your balls?
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Well I don't know.) 
"
12,10,Stan,"Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 
"
12,10,Cartman,"Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
"
12,10,Stan,"I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
"
12,10,Kyle,"I think Kenny likes it. 
"
12,10,Stan,"I gotta get home for dinner.
"
12,10,Cartman,"Yeah, me too. 
"
12,10,Stan,"God!
"
12,10,Cartman,"Shut up already!
"
12,10,Stan,"I'm outta here; see ya guys. 
"
12,10,TV,"Tonight, the Travel Channel takes you to London!  London has something for everyone! Sights!  Theater, and wonderful street performers! 
"
12,10,Stan,"They're in London too?
"
12,10,Sharon,"Hey, time for dinner guys. 
"
12,10,Sharon,"All right kids, dig in.
"
12,10,Stan,"Where's dad?
"
12,10,Sharon,"He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.
"
12,10,Stan,"Why?
"
12,10,Sharon,"Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
"
12,10,Randy,"All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. 
"
12,10,Sharon,"Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
"
12,10,Randy,"There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?
"
12,10,Shelly,"Turn it off, Dad!
"
12,10,Randy,"Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 
"
12,10,Stan,"Oh Jesus Christ! 
"
12,10,Randy,"Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. 
"
12,10,Cartman,"I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 
"
12,10,Stan,"You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
"
12,10,Cartman,"So?
"
12,10,Stan,"So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
"
12,10,Cartman,"How much?
"
12,10,Stan,"Over two hundred bucks.
"
12,10,Kyle,"Two hundred dollars?
"
12,10,Cartman,"Really? Are you sure?
"
12,10,Stan,"Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 
"
12,10,Kyle,"...Become a Peruvian flute band?
"
12,10,Stan,"Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
"
12,10,Cartman,"Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
"
12,10,Stan,"Yeah!
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
12,10,Kyle,"But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
"
12,10,Cartman,"Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
"
12,10,Craig,"...Fine.
"
12,10,Cartman,"Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
"
12,10,Craig,"...Yeah.
"
12,10,Stan,"Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 
"
12,10,Cartman,"Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
"
12,10,Craig,"What do you guys want?
"
12,10,Kyle,"Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
"
12,10,Cartman,"All right Craig! 
"
12,10,Craig,"You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
"
12,10,Stan,"There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.
"
12,10,Cartman,"And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
"
12,10,Craig,"You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.
"
12,10,Cartman,"Craig, don't be an asshole.
"
12,10,Craig,"I'll go get the money. 
"
12,10,Stan,"All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
"
12,10,Cartman,"And a one, and a two, and a- 
"
12,10,Man 1,"Wow, that's such cultural music.
"
12,10,Man 2,"Very cultural, yes.
"
12,10,Cartman,"Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. 
"
12,10,Kyle,"Gracias.
"
12,10,Woman 1,"How cultural. 
"
12,10,Kyle,"This is awesome!
"
12,10,Stan,"Ya see, Craig? 
"
12,10,Cartman,"Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! 
"
12,10,Stan,"Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 
"
12,10,Cartman,"No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
"
12,10,Stan,"This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 
"
12,10,Kyle,"God damn it!
"
12,10,Cartman,"No! No es bueno! 
"
12,10,Stan,"Come on, guys. 
"
12,10,Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
12,10,Cartman,"No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions. I'm talking of course about Peruvian flute bands.  The red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of Peruvian flute bands are. All over the world, wherever there are tourists or shoppers, there are now, on average, 65 Peruvian flute bands per square kilometer. General?
"
12,10,Chief Aide,"France, Japan, and the northeastern United States are currently the hardest hit. Make no mistake:  this is a pan flute epidemic.
"
12,10,Senator 1,"A pan-demic?
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands. We will need every resource available to see this through.
"
12,10,Senator 2,"Excuse me, but... aid other countries?
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Senator?
"
12,10,Senator 2,"With all due respect we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands! Let other countries fend for themselves!
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"You heartless bastard! This country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity! And we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by Peruvian flute bands! Is that clear?!  As director of Homeland Security, I am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained.
"
12,10,Paratrooper,"Go, go! 
"
12,10,Cartman,"Ha!  Serves you right, assholes! 
"
12,10,Soldier 1,"One more over here! 
"
12,10,Soldier 2,"Let's go! Get 'em out!
"
12,10,Soldier 3,"Clear out, move! This is a Homeland Security operation, people, let's go!
"
12,10,Stan,"Hey, back off!
"
12,10,Soldier 3,"Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained! 
"
12,10,Randy,"There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?
"
12,10,Sharon,"The news.
"
12,10,Randy,"Huh?
"
12,10,Sharon,"We're watching the news.
"
12,10,Randy,"That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting! 
"
12,10,Anchorman Tom,"The government efforts to stop the Peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day.  In cities all over the world  flute bands have been removed and quarantined.  But more may still be out there. Homeland Security's requesting that  if you see a Peruvian flute band, do not approach it. Mark down the flute band's location, and do not, under any circumstances, buy their CDs.  The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantined area in Miami.
"
12,10,Stan,"Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?
"
12,10,Kyle,"Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
"
12,10,Guard,"Get back! I'm not buying any of your damned CDs!
"
12,10,Stan,"No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
"
12,10,Guard,"I said I'm not buying any God damned CDs today, you got that?! I'm sick of it!
"
12,10,A Musician,"Señor? Comprar CD la musica? 
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)
"
12,10,Craig,"""Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole."" 
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Attention Peruvian flute bands:
"
12,10,Translator,"Atencione bandas de flauta Perú.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"We appreciate your cooperation and patience.
"
12,10,Translator,"Cooperacion y peciencia es apreciado.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Tomorrow you will be boarding ships...
"
12,10,Translator,"Mañana sera el embarque de barcos...
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"...which will take you to Guantanamo Bay.
"
12,10,Translator,"...que la lleva a viajar Guantanimo.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"There you will spend the rest of your lives.
"
12,10,Translator,"Donde pasar el resto de sus vidas. Gracias! 
"
12,10,Kyle,"Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
"
12,10,Stan,"Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
"
12,10,Sharon,"Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?
"
12,10,Mrs. Tucker,"No, I'm telling you. This isn't like Craig at all. I'm really worried.
"
12,10,Mr. Tucker,"You've checked with the police?
"
12,10,Gerald,"Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!
"
12,10,Sharon,"None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!
"
12,10,Randy,"Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.
"
12,10,Sharon,"Well then stop being an idiot and help!
"
12,10,Mr. Tucker,"Maybe the boys all ran away. Were any of your boys upset about anything?
"
12,10,Gerald,"All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
"
12,10,Sheila,"That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
"
12,10,Mrs. Tucker,"What is that supposed to mean?
"
12,10,Sharon,"To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.
"
12,10,Mrs. Tucker,"Now wait just a minute!
"
12,10,Sharon,"I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-
"
12,10,Mr. Tucker,"Like every kid doesn't have some problems!
"
12,10,Sheila,"Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.
"
12,10,Mrs. Tucker,"Oh my God!
"
12,10,Mr. Tucker,"This is ridiculous!
"
12,10,Randy,"Ohhh this is good!
"
12,10,Gerald,"That's not ridicul-
"
12,10,Soldier 4,"Sir, good news! Looks like we did it. Every major city is reporting zero Peruvian flute bands. We got 'em all! 
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Calm down people, we still have work to do! We have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again!
"
12,10,Official 1,"We don't know where they came from, sir. We... we've been researching, but we... can't figure it out.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Well think about it, idiot! Where else would ""Peruvian"" flute bands come from? 
"
12,10,Official 1,"Hmm...
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"The country is in the name!
"
12,10,Official 2,"No. Sir, we checked the entire map. There isn't a country called Peruvian anywhere.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Not Peruvian, retards, Peru! It's right here! 
"
12,10,Official 3,"Peh-roo.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Now I want a plan in place to take out Peru once and for all!
"
12,10,Official 1,"Is that really necessary, sir? It seems a little extreme.
"
12,10,Soldier 2,"Yeah.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us  unless they are stopped at the source!
"
12,10,Chief Aide,"Sir, you'd better come quick. One of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"See?  God damn it! 
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"The Llama Brothers: Tapas and Moodscapes.
"
12,10,Stan,"This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Right. You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a llama, but you're not a Peruvian flute band.
"
12,10,Stan,"We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
"
12,10,Kyle,"We just wanna go home.
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Which tourist location were they playing at?
"
12,10,Chief Aide,"An outdoor mall in Colorado.
"
12,10,Kyle,"Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
"
12,10,Stan,"We we speak English!
"
12,10,Cartman,"And we're White.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Let me talk to you guys out here.  Well what do you think?
"
12,10,Chief Aide,"I don't know what to make of it sir. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Clearly they are a Peruvian flute band and yet they... aren't. They play pan flute music like the others, but they talk and act like ...one of us.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"I agree. They're obviously some kind of... hybrid.
"
12,10,Official 1,"A hybrid? Ah how is that possible?
"
12,10,Chief Aide,"Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated with one of our females. Who knows?
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Well however they came to be, they're about the only piece of good luck we've had. 
"
12,10,Official 1,"Sir?
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"If they are the hybrid we're talking about,  then they could be our way of taking out Peru once and for all.
"
12,10,Craig,"Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.
"
12,10,Cartman,"You're being extremely negative, Craig. 
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"All right, here's the deal: Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us... we'll get you home.
"
12,10,Stan,"Help you how?
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"You're able to walk amongst the Peruvian flute bands. They see you as one of them. We are going to send you to their Capital.
"
12,10,Craig,"Can we please just go home, sir?
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"We still don't know whose side you're on! You do this, and we'll know! You leave for Peru in the morning.
"
12,10,Kyle,"No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 
"
12,10,Stan,"Kyle, calm down.
"
12,10,Kyle,"You know I can't go there, Stan!
"
12,10,Stan,"One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. 
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"You don't have a choice! Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.
"
12,10,Soldier 3,"Thompson, can you come over here?  The flute band players won't shut up about something and I can't understand them.
"
12,10,Musician 2,"¡Por favor! ¡No podemos ir! ¡Estamos aquí para proteger a ustedes!
"
12,10,Musician 3,"Sí.
"
12,10,Other Musicians,"Sí. No podemos ir. Si, protectores.
"
12,10,Thompson,"They're saying something like, ""You can't send us away. We are the protectors.""
"
12,10,Soldier 3,"Protectors from what?
"
12,10,Musician 2,"¡La muerte peluda! ¡La muerte peluda!
"
12,10,Soldier 3,"What does that mean?
"
12,10,Thompson,"I think he said, ""the furry death""?
"
12,10,Musician 2,"La muerte peluda. ¡La muerte peluda!
"
12,10,Announcer,"This is CNN.
"
12,10,Anchorman Tom,"The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world. Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade and Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect.
"
12,10,Paul Harris,"Really welcome silence, Tom. There hasn't been a Peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now, and everyone is really enjoying the peace. The world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the-  What the?! 
"
12,10,Woman 2,"Oh my Gohhhd!
"
12,10,Woman 3,"Ohmigod! 
"
12,10,Paul Harris,"Jesus Christ! 
"
12,10,Shopper,"AAAAHHH!! 
"
12,10,Paul Harris,"There's, there's something else here, it's...  It's not a Peruvian flute band, it's a... Oh my God what is that thing?! 
"
12,10,Anchorman Tom,"Paul Paul, what do you see?
"
12,10,Paul Harris,"It's furry! It's very furry! 
"
12,10,Anchorman Tom,"Okay obviously something different has uh shown up a-... Did he say ""furry""?  Okay uh we're we're experiencing some uh-  My God what is that thing?!  AAAHHH!! 
"
12,10,Pilot,"All right, we're about 800 kilometers from Peru. There'll be a truck to take you inside the border where you're briefed on mission specifics. 
"
12,10,Craig,"Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said ""Hey, you know? This plan might backfire.""  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.
"
12,10,Kyle,"That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
"
12,10,Stan,"Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
"
12,10,Craig,"I'm being a dick?
"
12,10,Stan,"Yes!
"
12,10,Craig,"You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?
"
12,10,Cartman,"There's no talking to this guy.
"
12,10,Stan,"All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
"
12,10,Craig,"That would be great. Thank you.
"
12,10,Kyle,"This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Because they're trying to take over the world?)
"
12,10,Kyle,"Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
"
12,10,Sharon,"Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you.  Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!
"
12,10,Randy,"Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
"
12,10,Sharon,"I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! 
"
12,10,Randy,"What the hell was that? 
"
12,10,Sharon,"Oh my God.
"
12,10,Randy,"Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here! 
"
12,10,Shelly,"What's going on, Dad? 
"
12,10,Randy,"Get back to your room, Shelly! 
"
12,10,Randy,"What's going on?
"
12,10,Mr. Garrison,"They're all over the place!
"
12,10,Randy,"What are?!
"
12,10,Mr. Garrison,"They're really furry! 
"
12,10,Randy,"What did that?!  What is that thing?! 
"
12,10,Officer Barbrady,"Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here! 
"
12,10,Linda,"AAAAAAAAH!! 
"
12,10,Randy,"Oh my Gohhhd!
"
12,10,Stephen,"Go go go go back the other way! 
"
12,10,Randy,"Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.
"
12,10,A Woman,"Oh my Gohhhd! 
"
12,10,Randy,"HAAA! 
"
12,10,Chief Aide,"Sir? We've got a bigger problem.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Oh? And what might that be?
"
12,10,Chief Aide,"New reports are coming in from cities all over the world. Word of massive destruction and death by what ap-pear to be... 
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Guinea pigs?
"
12,10,Chief Aide,"Yes sir. How did you know?
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis, did you know that?
"
12,10,Davis,"Sir?
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"I really thought you had me in Miami, but you just couldn't quite put the pieces together.
"
12,10,Davis,"You... You... knew this was going to happen.
"
12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis, and I can't let you interfere.  Sorry my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen. The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising, and the only person who could have stopped all this... is on his way to the middle of nowhere. 
"
12,11,Shelly,"What's going on, Dad? 
"
12,11,Officer Barbrady,"Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- 
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh God.  I'm-  I'm so-  Startled.  ARRRGH!
"
12,11,Craig,"My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars.  I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house  and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band.  They promised I would double my money in one afternoon.  But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami.  We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru.  And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. 
"
12,11,Stan,"We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
"
12,11,Kyle,"Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"I don't get it. They said the military would meet us here.
"
12,11,Cpt. Gabriel,"This is where they told us to land. Can you get through to Washington?
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"I'm trying. 
"
12,11,A Voice,"This is Connor in Washington.
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"Hey, Connor, the place that Homeland Security told us to start the operation, there, there's nobody here to meet us. It's like they sent us to no man's land.
"
12,11,Carter,"Jesus they're everywhere!
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"What are everywhere?
"
12,11,Carter,"...so furry! They're attacking... every city... ha- people dying... Ha-... guinea pigs... all over! Agh.
"
12,11,Stan,"Guinea pigs?
"
12,11,Carter,"Can't stop them! Need to get... out... ergh. I just ate... a peanut... Agh peanut now stuck... in throat... Urgh shouldn't eat peanut... when scared. 
"
12,11,Randy,"I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly.
"
12,11,Sharon,"Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.
"
12,11,Randy,"I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.
"
12,11,Sharon,"We have to see what the news is saying. 
"
12,11,Reporter,"This is a shot of New York City where the... giant guinea pigs have also attacked.
"
12,11,Sharon,"Guinea pigs?
"
12,11,Reporter,"Reports of attacks are coming in from major cities all over the world.
"
12,11,Randy,"Jesus, this thing is worldwide? 
"
12,11,Sharon,"Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? 
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
"
12,11,Sharon,"Go Randy, run! 
"
12,11,Randy,"Gotta get out!
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"Michaels, Harrison, anybody?  Nothing. LSAT is down and no answer at RCU. Whatever is going on out there is huge.
"
12,11,Stan,"Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"...Yes, that was the order.
"
12,11,Kyle,"And that makes sense to you?
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"Nope, not at all.
"
12,11,Cpt. Gabriel,"Actually, the whole rounding up of the pan flute bands didn't make sense to any of us either.
"
12,11,Stan,"None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"You don't understand, the plan was to have a refueling truck meet us here. We don't have enough gas to fly anyplace.
"
12,11,Craig,"Oh, that's awesome.
"
12,11,Kyle,"So we've gotta find another way out of here.
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"It's starting to look that way, yeah.
"
12,11,Craig,"This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.
"
12,11,Cartman,"You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
"
12,11,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
12,11,Cartman,"Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
"
12,11,Cpt. Gabriel,"Luck at that: no lights on, nothing. It's like, humans have never been to this part of Peru. 
"
12,11,Top Official,"More guinea pigs seem to be moving in from all directions. We checked on Wikipedia and found out that guinea pigs are from the Andes Mountains, here. 
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"What about the pan flute bands? Are they on their way to Guantanamo Bay?
"
12,11,Official 1,"...Sir, we believe we have bigger problems right now than pan flute bands.
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"Have they been loaded onto the boats or not?!
"
12,11,Official 2,"No sir. We diverted all the resources away from the pan flute bands to deal with the guinea pigs.
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"That was an order!  The pan flute bands were to be put on boats to Guantanamo last night!  I am still in charge here! I want those pan flute bands on the boats to Guantanamo!
"
12,11,Soldier 4,"Yes sir. I don't see why you have to yell at people. 
"
12,11,Randy,"Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!
"
12,11,Sharon,"Where do we go, Randy?
"
12,11,Randy,"We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. 
"
12,11,Man,"Geow, my arm! MY ARM! 
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh Jesus!
"
12,11,Sharon,"Randy, run! 
"
12,11,Randy,"Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!
"
12,11,Shelly,"Dad! 
"
12,11,Randy,"In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?
"
12,11,Sharon,"Randy, put down that c-! 
"
12,11,Shelly,"It's gonna kill us!
"
12,11,Sharon,"Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. 
"
12,11,Randy,"Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. 
"
12,11,Sharon,"Randy? Where are you going? 
"
12,11,Randy,"Here we see a view from outside the bus.
"
12,11,Sharon,"Randy!  What the hell are you doing?
"
12,11,Randy,"I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. 
"
12,11,Cpt. Gabriel,"I don't know, Lemsky. This entire area of Peru isn't even charted on the maps.
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"This whole valley is strange. Just look at the size of that fruit.  Ain't that a peach? And how do you like them apples?
"
12,11,Cpt. Gabriel,"Take a look at this! They look like... beehive combs.
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"Oh my God.
"
12,11,Stan,"Dude, what is this place?
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"It's like... an unknown valley that time forgot, where everything grows huge.
"
12,11,Craig,"That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.
"
12,11,Stan,"Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
"
12,11,Kyle,"Yeah. Stuff just happens.
"
12,11,Craig,"Stuff just happens.
"
12,11,Kyle,"That's right!
"
12,11,Craig,"You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.
"
12,11,Cartman,"That's right.
"
12,11,Craig,"You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"Look, wherever we are, I think we'd better keep moving.
"
12,11,Kenny,"(Hey, look out!) 
"
12,11,Cpt. Taylor,"Ohhh stop it, make it stohhhp!
"
12,11,Randy,"All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.
"
12,11,Butters,"Hello, heh.
"
12,11,Linda,"What is that? Chris, what is that?
"
12,11,Randy,"That's a that's a, that's a new sound. 
"
12,11,Stephen,"Oh God look!
"
12,11,Sharon,"Those aren't guinea pigs.
"
12,11,Stephen,"Get off the roof! 
"
12,11,Randy,"Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. 
"
12,11,An Anchorman,"And we are now getting word of giant bees. The giant bees have been seen in the U.S. and Europe.
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh no! Oho oho. 
"
12,11,Townsman,"Get away, there's bees everywhere!  There's another one right there!  
"
12,11,Townsman 2,"It stung me! It stung me! 
"
12,11,Randy,"Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!
"
12,11,Kyle,"Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
"
12,11,Cartman,"Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 
"
12,11,Kenny,"(I think we're fucked!)
"
12,11,Kyle,"Hey, hey, look at this. 
"
12,11,Cartman,"What is it?
"
12,11,Kyle,"I don't know. It's old.
"
12,11,Stan,"Let's see what's in there.
"
12,11,Craig,"""Let's see what's in there."" That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say ""Let's see what's in there.""
"
12,11,Stan,"It might be a way out, Craig!
"
12,11,Cartman,"Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! 
"
12,11,Kyle,"Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
"
12,11,Kenny,"(Yeah. Totally.)
"
12,11,Stan,"You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 
"
12,11,Kyle,"Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.
"
12,11,Stan,"I know, a-and look. 
"
12,11,Cartman,"Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
"
12,11,Kyle,"Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 
"
12,11,Stan,"And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 
"
12,11,Cartman,"Dude, it's Craig!
"
12,11,Craig,"What?
"
12,11,Kyle,"That is Craig. 
"
12,11,Stan,"Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?
"
12,11,Craig,"I have no idea.
"
12,11,Cartman,"Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
"
12,11,Craig,"I don't know.
"
12,11,Top Official,"There is now word of huge beehives forming in cities across the U.S. and Canada. Europe and China are reporting deaths by guinea pigs in the tens of thousands.
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"And how are the efforts to contain all this going?
"
12,11,Official 3,"It's bad, sir. It seems we have no way of stopping it; we've lost complete control. 
"
12,11,Top Official,"Uh, sir?
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"Ah I'm sorry, I just thought of a funny joke.
"
12,11,Official 1,"Oh, a-hah.
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"All right, get the jets ready. I need to get to Machu Picchu.
"
12,11,Soldier,"Uh, Machu Picchu, sir?
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"Yes, I need to be taken to Machu Picchu! Have you lost your hearing?!
"
12,11,Official 1,"But S-sir, what could possibly be at Machu Picchu to help the-
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"Am I in charge or not?! 
"
12,11,Randy,"We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.
"
12,11,Sharon,"Can we get out through the highway?
"
12,11,Soldier 5,"The highway is unreachable; there's guinea rats all over it.
"
12,11,Mr. Garrison,"Guinea rats?
"
12,11,Randy,"I'm so startled.
"
12,11,Mr. Garrison,"What do you mean ""guinea rats""?
"
12,11,Soldier 5,"Look, there are guinea pigs, but there's also guinea bees, guinea rats. I've even seen some guinea spiders out there.
"
12,11,Sharon,"Randy, will you stop doing that?! 
"
12,11,Stephen,"Look, I I need we need to find a way out under the city.
"
12,11,Mr. Garrison,"In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?
"
12,11,A Woman,"Oh my God!
"
12,11,Townsman 3,"Something's inside the store!
"
12,11,Townsman 4,"Guinea rabbits! They're inside! 
"
12,11,Townsman 5,"God they're everywhere!
"
12,11,Townsman 6,"Help me!  Help... me... 
"
12,11,Townswoman 1,"Travis! No!
"
12,11,Randy,"You can't help him!
"
12,11,Stephen,"There's something over there!
"
12,11,Townsman 7,"It's a guinea bear!
"
12,11,Randy,"No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid! 
"
12,11,Townswoman 2,"Kill me!
"
12,11,Sharon,"Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom! 
"
12,11,Shelly,"Mom, I can't see.
"
12,11,Randy,"It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  There. There. Okay. Gaaah! 
"
12,11,Sharon,"What what what what?
"
12,11,Randy,"Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah! 
"
12,11,Stan,"Let's head over this way, guys.
"
12,11,Kyle,"Hear that? It sounds like water.
"
12,11,Cartman,"Yeah, it's coming from up there.
"
12,11,Stan,"Wow. 
"
12,11,Cartman,"Dude, that's awesome.
"
12,11,Stan,"All right, let's go. 
"
12,11,Craig,"No.
"
12,11,Stan,"Wait, whattaya mean no?
"
12,11,Craig,"I'm not following you guys any more.
"
12,11,Stan,"Dude, we we have to go check this out.
"
12,11,Craig,"Why?
"
12,11,Stan,"'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
"
12,11,Craig,"Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because ""that's just the way it is.""
"
12,11,Stan,"Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
"
12,11,Craig,"I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.
"
12,11,Kyle,"How do you do that?
"
12,11,Craig,"It's easy. Watch. 
"
12,11,Stan,"Craig, dude, wait up.
"
12,11,Cartman,"Dude, Craig, we should go back now.
"
12,11,Craig,"No.
"
12,11,Stan,"Hey look, there's something here.
"
12,11,Craig,"...Nope.
"
12,11,Cartman,"Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
"
12,11,Craig,"Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.
"
12,11,Randy,"It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say ""hey"" guys.
"
12,11,Shelly,"What is that? What is that? 
"
12,11,Randy,"I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! 
"
12,11,Randy,"What is it?
"
12,11,Husband,"It's a Guineasaurus Rex! 
"
12,11,Shelly,"Oh my Gohhhd!
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh no, I'm way too startled!
"
12,11,Sharon,"Look! 
"
12,11,Randy,"Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?
"
12,11,Sharon,"Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!
"
12,11,Randy,"Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. 
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"Wait here a minute.  Behold! I am standing on your precious land! I've waited a long time for this! 
"
12,11,Soldier 6,"What's he doing?
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"What of your prophecy now?! Nothing can stop me!  Craiiig!  No! How did you get here?!
"
12,11,Cartman,"Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
"
12,11,Soldier 6,"Sir, ih-is everything all right?
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"Shoot them!
"
12,11,Soldier 7,"Shoot them?
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"They're a Peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained.
"
12,11,Stan,"No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"I said shoot them!
"
12,11,Kyle,"Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
"
12,11,Top Official,"Maybe we should look at it, sir.
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"Damn you Craiiig! You just don't ever stop, do you?!
"
12,11,Craig,"I didn't say anything.
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"You see, for thousands of years horrid creatures have lived in the Guinea Valley of Peru. The Incas learned how to keep the creatures at bay: by playing pan flute music. Guinea creatures hate it even more than humans do. But the prophecy foretold that one day the creatures would be unleashed and I have made that happen! The Incas predicted the world would be saved... by Craig. But that part of the prophecy will not come true! For you will all die on this mountain! 
"
12,11,Top Official,"You're, you're some kind of monster.
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"Oh, I'm much more than that. Guinea bees, guinea rabbits, guineasaurus rexes, I am something much more evil!  Arrrgh.
"
12,11,Top Official,"Guinea pirate! 
"
12,11,Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
12,11,Craig,"Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See? 
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"Dargh, no!
"
12,11,Craig,"Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.
"
12,11,Michael Chertoff,"Argh, curse ye, Craig. Dar, argh. 
"
12,11,Craig,"My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains.  Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed.  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen.
"
12,11,Randy,"Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. 
"
12,11,Craig,"The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security.  My parents were sooo happy.  I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.  We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. 
"
12,11,Cartman,"That guy's an asshole!
"
12,11,Kyle,"Yeah, what a dick!
"
12,11,Kenny,"(I fuckin' hate Craig!)
"
12,11,Top Official 2,"Sir! Sir, we have a problem!
"
12,11,New Director,"What now?!
"
12,11,Top Official 2,"The former director of Homeland Security, that turned out to be a guinea pig? It attacked the guards, got out of its holding cell.
"
12,11,New Director,"My God, are you telling me..?
"
12,11,Top Official 2,"Yes sir. It broke out of prison. 
"
12,12,Obama,"If there is anyone out there tonight who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. 
"
12,12,Randy,"Yyeeaahh!!!!  Obama!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
"
12,12,Gerald,"Yyeeaahh!!!!
"
12,12,Obama,"It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America.
"
12,12,Randy,"Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!
"
12,12,Obama,"Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. We will name him ""Sparkles"".
"
12,12,Randy,"He's so awesome!  He's so perfect and awesome!
"
12,12,Obama,"Where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can.
"
12,12,Supporters,"Yes we can!
"
12,12,Randy,"Yes I can! Yes I can! 
"
12,12,Randy,"Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! 
"
12,12,Mr. Harris,"Did you see? Our man is in! 
"
12,12,Mrs. Harris,"We did it!
"
12,12,Mr. Adler,"Everything is going to be awesome now!
"
12,12,Randy,"This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
"
12,12,Linda Black,"I don't even know what to do now.
"
12,12,Randy,"I know what to do!  Losers! Looosers!
"
12,12,Crowd,"Looosers! Looosers!
"
12,12,Stephen,"Oh, shut up!
"
12,12,Crowd,"Looosers!
"
12,12,Butters,"We lost?
"
12,12,McCain,"It is natural. It's natural tonight to feel some disappointment. We fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.
"
12,12,Supporters,"No no! Noo nooo!
"
12,12,Butters,"Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
"
12,12,Stephen,"No. No, this can't happen! No! 
"
12,12,Linda,"Stephen!
"
12,12,Stephen,"It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead.
"
12,12,Linda,"You don't know that, Stephen!
"
12,12,Mr. Mackey,"With an inexperienced man as President, we do know it! He is right! Game over, man! Okay?!
"
12,12,Mr. Garrison,"We'll probably be dead by sunrise!
"
12,12,Stephen,"Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu... 
"
12,12,Randy,"WOOOO Obama!
"
12,12,Mr. Garrison,"Get out o'here!
"
12,12,Kyle,"Dude, have you seen my parents? 
"
12,12,Stan,"No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
"
12,12,Kyle,"He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
"
12,12,Reporter 1,"Uh Mr. President, over here!
"
12,12,Reporter 2,"Congratulations!
"
12,12,Reporter 3,"Great start, great job!
"
12,12,Reporter 4,"Change!
"
12,12,Reporter 5,"Great job, Mr. President!
"
12,12,Reporter 6,"Great job, Obama!
"
12,12,Obama,"Thank you all for your support. If you don't mind, I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening getting some much needed rest.  Senator McCain.
"
12,12,McCain,"President Obama. 
"
12,12,"McCain, Obama","Boom, baby!
"
12,12,Obama,"Ohoh man that was perfect! 
"
12,12,McCain,"I almost thought we were gonna tie for a minute there. That would have screwed us.
"
12,12,Obama,"You played it perfectly, there was no way.
"
12,12,McCain,"It's McCain, we did it! Obama is President.
"
12,12,Davis,"Yeah, so I've heard. You guys are out of your freakin' minds, you know that?
"
12,12,McCain,"Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours.
"
12,12,Davis,"Sure. Hard part's over, right?
"
12,12,McCain,"Actually, the hard part's just starting.
"
12,12,Reveler 1,"Yoohoo!
"
12,12,Reveler 2,"Obama yeah, I can't believe it!
"
12,12,Randy,"O ba ma! O ba ma!
"
12,12,Revelers,"O ba ma! O ba ma!
"
12,12,Randy,"Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on!  It's Obamobama! 
"
12,12,Stan,"Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. 
"
12,12,Crowd,"Obama!
"
12,12,Randy,"Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!
"
12,12,Crowd,"OooooOOOOooo! 
"
12,12,Barbrady,"Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!
"
12,12,Randy,"BOOOO! 
"
12,12,Reveler,"...party Obama!
"
12,12,Barbrady,"Come on, time to go home.
"
12,12,Randy,"What are you? A McCain voter?
"
12,12,Crowd,"Yeah!
"
12,12,Randy,"Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Obama! Obama! 
"
12,12,Crowd,"Obama! Obama!
"
12,12,Randy,"Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 
"
12,12,Barbrady,"Ey, put down my car! 
"
12,12,Revelers,"Yes we can! 
"
12,12,Barbrady,"No! No! Hey, stop it!
"
12,12,Stan,"Jesus Christ...
"
12,12,Randy,"O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! 
"
12,12,Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? 
"
12,12,Quincy,"Bravo Obama and McCain. Ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally pulled it off!
"
12,12,McCain,"Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever.
"
12,12,Neely,"I knew it! I knew when you two ran for President you were just working an angle.
"
12,12,Obama,"Always workin' the angles.
"
12,12,McCain,"My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history.
"
12,12,Quincy,"So, come on, enlighten us. What are we stealing this time? 
"
12,12,Obama,"The Hope Diamond, rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world. Going street value, Middle-Eastern market, of course, two hundred and ten million dollars.
"
12,12,Davis,"Two hundred ten?
"
12,12,McCain,"Million.
"
12,12,Quincy,"No no no, the Hope Diamond is ungettable. Every thief in the world knows that.
"
12,12,Obama,"Almost ungettable. The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, long considered to be the most thief-proof structure ever built.  The Diamond Wing Is protected by impenetrable walls of two-foot wide steel. On the northeast side, a seven-five laser system.  There's simply no side of the Smithsonian that can be breached.
"
12,12,Davis,"So you go in from the roof, drop into it from the top.
"
12,12,Obama,"Can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse.
"
12,12,Quincy,"Okay, you can't get into the museum from any side and you can't drop in from above, so you can't get the diamond. 
"
12,12,McCain,"Meet... the Presidential Escape Tunnel,  A two-mile long underground passage that runs from the White House to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack. The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum.
"
12,12,"Neely, Davis","Boom, baby!
"
12,12,McCain,"You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on.
"
12,12,Quincy,"So you both run for President because one of you has to win, and you've got your access to the tunnel.
"
12,12,McCain,"And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours.
"
12,12,Quincy,"This all sounds very risky.
"
12,12,Obama,"We've spent ten years putting this plan together. If we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world-
"
12,12,Neely,"And we are.
"
12,12,Obama,"-we won't get caught.
"
12,12,Kyle,"Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
"
12,12,Stan,"Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.
"
12,12,Kyle,"What?!
"
12,12,Stan,"Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
"
12,12,Kyle,"Oh my God! 
"
12,12,Kyle,"Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
"
12,12,Ike,"Good-bye. 
"
12,12,"Stan, Kyle","NOO!
"
12,12,Kyle,"Ike?  Oh crap Ike?
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"All right, everyone, I'm turning in for the night. Go to standard security, team 3.
"
12,12,SS Agent,"Sir! S-sir, we have a bit of a problem.
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"What?
"
12,12,SS Agent,"The new President-elect is here. Eh he wants into the Oval Office.
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"Barack Obama? 
"
12,12,SS Agent 2,"They're all, they're all right through here, sir.
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"Uh, hello, is there something we can do for you, Mr. Obama?
"
12,12,Obama,"Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys?
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"Good, sir.
"
12,12,Obama,"I'd like to see the Oval Office, please?
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"Right now?
"
12,12,Obama,"I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I wanna redecorate, if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff.
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"Sure, right this way, Mr... President. 
"
12,12,Obama,"I will need absolute privacy, is that understood?
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"Yes sir. 
"
12,12,Obama,"Thanks. 
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"I got a hundred dollars. 
"
12,12,Obama,"All right, McCain. I'm in.
"
12,12,McCain,"Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian.  You find the escape tunnel?
"
12,12,Obama,"I'm already on it.  Boom baby.
"
12,12,Reveler 3,"Yehhheheah!
"
12,12,Randy,"Wooo, change.
"
12,12,Reveler 4,"Change.
"
12,12,Reveler 5,"Change.
"
12,12,Stan,"Dad Dad, we have a problem.
"
12,12,Randy,"Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.
"
12,12,Stan,"No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
"
12,12,Randy,"We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.
"
12,12,Stan,"Dude, he's wasted.
"
12,12,Randy,"Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss! 
"
12,12,Randy's Boss,"Oh, hello Marsh.
"
12,12,Randy,"Yeah, you know what? Fuck you! 
"
12,12,Randy's Boss,"Huh?
"
12,12,Randy,"You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!
"
12,12,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?!
"
12,12,Randy,"It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!
"
12,12,Randy's Boss,"Hey, I voted for Obama.
"
12,12,Randy,"Obama's not talkin' about you!
"
12,12,Kyle,"Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 
"
12,12,Palin,"I just wanna say to everyone who's a little disappointed that we lost the election that there's always next year. Maybe I'll run again for Vice President again in 2009. 
"
12,12,Reporter 1,"Uh Mrs. Palin, have you seen or heard from John McCain?
"
12,12,Palin,"Uh, uh, nnno, I don't really know where he went. Kinda seems a little odd, I guess, but  Oh, my phone's going ringy. Ex-cuse me.  Hello?
"
12,12,McCain,"Hello Sarah, it's McCain.
"
12,12,Palin,"I hope to God you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the L7 charges.
"
12,12,Obama,"I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. I should be almost below the museum.
"
12,12,Palin,"Just make sure you don't blow the transformers along with the tunnel because it will trigger the five-four laser system! And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Gary shuts down the grid. I'll be there in thirty.
"
12,12,Obama,"God she's awesome.
"
12,12,Palin,"Oh, I guess Senator McCain's gonna fly me back to Alaska now. He's got a private jet, you know? Okay, byebye then.  Bloody idiots. 
"
12,12,McCain,"All right, here we go. 
"
12,12,Guard 1,"What's that noise?
"
12,12,Guard 2,"It's okay, just some construction outside. 
"
12,12,Obama,"Oh no.  McCain? We've got a problem. 
"
12,12,Kyle,"Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
"
12,12,Stan,"Hey, there's some people. 
"
12,12,Stephen,"Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark. 
"
12,12,Supporter 1,"You have to let us in! You know the country's doomed!
"
12,12,Woman Supporter 1,"Who are you to turn us away?!
"
12,12,Stephen,"I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!
"
12,12,Kyle,"Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
"
12,12,Stephen,"I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya!
"
12,12,Supporter 2,"You're going to deny them too?
"
12,12,Supporter 1,"For God's sake, man, they're children!  Look them in the eyes and tell them you won't take them in!  Look at their little cheeks!
"
12,12,Stan,"Let go of my face, asshole!
"
12,12,Stephen,"All right, damn you! The children can come in!
"
12,12,Kyle,"No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
"
12,12,Supporter 3,"Okay, then I want their place.
"
12,12,Supporter 4,"Me too.
"
12,12,Kyle,"We NEED a ride to the hospital!
"
12,12,Supporter 1,"THERE ISN'T GONNA BE A HOSPITAL! DON'T YOU GET IT?!
"
12,12,Woman Supporter 2,"Let us in now! 
"
12,12,Mr. Garrison,"Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down!
"
12,12,Supporter 5,"Obama hasn't been elected four hours and already the country's going to hell! 
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"Mr. Obama?  Sir?  All right, give me the keys. 
"
12,12,Obama,"Is there a problem, gentlemen?
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"Uh, no. No, sir. Everything okay in there?
"
12,12,Obama,"Why wouldn't it be? I'm sorry, but I asked to be left alone?
"
12,12,Chief of Security,"Yes, sir, it's, just that... your wife is here.
"
12,12,Obama,"My wife?
"
12,12,Michelle,"Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing?
"
12,12,Obama,"Uh, c-c-come on in, darling.  Thank, thank you boys. 
"
12,12,Michelle,"Okay Barack, tell me what's going on?
"
12,12,Obama,"Michelle, there's something I need to tell you.
"
12,12,Michelle,"What is it?  Barack, what is it?!
"
12,12,Obama,"The laser system guarding the diamond was replaced by an optical relay three days ago.
"
12,12,Michelle,"You gotta be kiddin' me. So the entire diamond vault is inaccessible?! Is McCain online?
"
12,12,McCain,"Hi, Michelle.
"
12,12,Michelle,"You guys weren't runnin' update checks on the security logs?!
"
12,12,McCain,"Michelle, we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay.
"
12,12,Michelle,"On a new system, in an hour?! Are you nuts? My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three scan hacks into a laser system!
"
12,12,Palin,"Michelle, it's Sarah. They did replace the laser system, but the new one isn't brand-new. It's an old H-7 series. You can break this baby in 30 minutes.
"
12,12,Michelle,"Egh. Tell Davis to get me a fortrans emitter and enough pulse drives to light a spark.
"
12,12,Obama,"Did you catch that, Davis?
"
12,12,Davis,"I'm on it.
"
12,12,Kyle,"We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 
"
12,12,Nurse,"There, just take a seat over there.
"
12,12,Kyle,"E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
"
12,12,Nurse,"Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?
"
12,12,Stan,"Why does that matter?
"
12,12,Nurse,"Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself. 
"
12,12,Kyle,"Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
"
12,12,Nurse,"You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere.
"
12,12,Stan,"So where's the other doctor? 
"
12,12,Randy,"Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. 
"
12,12,Michelle,"I've almost got it. You're only going to have five minutes. Do you understand?
"
12,12,Obama,"Did you really not like pretending to be married?
"
12,12,Michelle,"Oh Jesus, now is not the time, B.
"
12,12,Obama,"Come on. You have to admit we had some fun.
"
12,12,Michelle,"My girls need somebody better than a world-class diamond thief. Woowait, there! I got it.
"
12,12,Obama,"All right, everyone. We're about to go. So here's the revised schedule: 4:40 a.m., the team gathers at the northwest exit of the museum.  4:45 a.m., Michelle hacks the optical relay, allowing me access to the rear doors.
"
12,12,Michelle,"Go! 
"
12,12,Obama,"4:46, from inside I can open the doors and let in the rest of the crew.  5:10 a.m., at the Department of Power Quincy shuts down the grid, disabling power to the vault room. 5:12, my grandmother who faked her death on Monday calls in a bomb threat to the museum.
"
12,12,Grandma Obama,"I said I put a bomb in your building, bitch.
"
12,12,Obama,"5:13, the guards open the southwest door, checking the museum for any bombs.  5:14, McCain, dressed as a football player, enters security and shuts off the diamond case alarm. 
"
12,12,A Guard,"Hey you! Stop!
"
12,12,Obama,"Michelle and I head back into the tunnel and the hole is patched.  5:15 a.m., I walk out of the Oval Office with the diamond securely hidden in my anus.
"
12,12,Obama,"All done. Thanks. 
"
12,12,All,"Boom, baby!
"
12,12,Quincy,"There's just one thing: don't you think people are going to be suspicious when you disappear? Go looking for you?
"
12,12,Obama,"We hired a guy for that a couple of months ago. 
"
12,12,Kyle,"What the hell?  Ike?
"
12,12,Ike,"Boom, baby.
"
12,12,Flight Attendant,"Here are all the tickets for your group, Mr. Sanchez.
"
12,12,McCain,"Thank you very much.
"
12,12,Quincy,"Well friends, let us depart.
"
12,12,Obama,"Hey uh, you guys go ahead. I just came to say goodbye.
"
12,12,Neely,"Wha?
"
12,12,Obama,"I decided to hang it up, maybe give this President thing a shot.
"
12,12,McCain,"B, you can't be serious.
"
12,12,Quincy,"Besides, you died in a jet in the Rocky Mountains, remember?
"
12,12,Obama,"Could have been I didn't make that flight.  What do you say, Michelle? Would you and your girls like to move into the White House with me? You know, settle down, just be President and First Lady for a while.
"
12,12,Michelle,"You're serious.
"
12,12,Obama,"Who knows? Maybe we could change a few things. What do you say?
"
12,12,Michelle,"Aww, what the fuck. 
"
12,12,McCain,"I just looove happy endings.
"
12,12,Stephen,"It's still here, ih... it's all still here.
"
12,12,Mr. Garrison,"Does that mean... maybe we overreacted?
"
12,12,Stephen,"No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right.
"
12,12,Randy,"Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!
"
12,12,Stan,"Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
"
12,12,Randy,"Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! 
"
12,13,Cartman,"Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. 
"
12,13,Butters,"Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
"
12,13,Kyle,"What's High School Musical 3?
"
12,13,Clyde,"You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2.
"
12,13,Stan,"What's High School Musical 1 and 2?
"
12,13,Cartman,"There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
"
12,13,Jason,"What's High School Musical 1 and... Dude, it's only the most popular thing with kids in our age group!
"
12,13,Jimmy,"Yeah. Where the hell have you guys ...been?
"
12,13,Craig,"Peru.
"
12,13,Bebe,"And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo.
"
12,13,Millie,"Bridon Gueermo? Oh he's such a dream!
"
12,13,Red,"I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody.
"
12,13,Wendy,"That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. 
Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out! 
"
12,13,Bebe,"As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.
"
12,13,Girls' Table,"That's what bein' friends is about.
(Oh ye-ah)
Everyone is special in their own way, and we'll always be together as one.
"
12,13,Cartman,"What the hell are they doing?
"
12,13,Girls' Table,"- Together as one -
"
12,13,Stan,"I have no idea. 
"
12,13,Girls' Table,"As long as we stick together, together we'll stay.
And every kid in school is special in their own way.
"
12,13,Cartman,"Dude, girls are such fags. 
"
12,13,Kids,"Oh yeah, oh yeah!
"
12,13,Boys,"Boys... are special in their own way.
"
12,13,Girls,"Girls... are special like a birthday.
"
12,13,Kids,"We'll always be dancin' and singin' aloud. Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh!
"
12,13,Heidi,"Here he comes. 
"
12,13,A Boy,"I like havin' fun in the hot summer sun (wooo!)
An' groovin' to the beat when my homework is all done. (yeah!)
If you ask me what I know, then you know what I will say?
That every single body is special in their own way.
"
12,13,Stan,"Who the hell is that?
"
12,13,Butters,"Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
"
12,13,Bebe,"He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times.
"
12,13,Kids,"Everyone is special in their own way
"
12,13,Bridon,"Special in their own way!
"
12,13,Kids,"Move to the beat and let your spirit out!
"
12,13,Bridon,"Let it out! Party people!
"
12,13,Kids,"As long as we have each other, we'll never have any trouble.
That's what bein' friends is about.
"
12,13,Kyle,"Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
"
12,13,Stan,"Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...
"
12,13,Singers,"You've gotta go with the status quo. If you wanna be a regular Joe. (come on now)
And your dreams are only a beat away; don't let 'em tell you no. (tell you no-o-o)
You've gotta go with the status quo. Keep singing 'bout the status quo (keep singing 'bout the status)
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status quo (go with the status quo). That's where we should go. (Go there now)
Copies of pop songs packaged by Disney and turned into a show (into a show).
That's the status quo! That's the status quo (That's the status quo) That's the status quohh!
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status-
"
12,13,Cartman,"This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. 
"
12,13,Stan,"Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
"
12,13,Kyle,"They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
"
12,13,Cartman,"Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.
"
12,13,Stan,"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.
"
12,13,Kyle,"I'm not doing it either. Kenny?
"
12,13,Kenny,"(No way in hell I'm doing it.)
"
12,13,Stan,"All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. 
"
12,13,Kyle,"I swear
"
12,13,Kenny,"(I swear too.)
"
12,13,Stan,"Okay, good.
"
12,13,Cartman,"Ehhhhhhh. 
"
12,13,Kyle,"What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
"
12,13,Cartman,"I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
"
12,13,Stan,"But you didn't die?
"
12,13,Cartman,"...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. 
"
12,13,Mr. Garrison,"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats.  Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.  This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.
"
12,13,Wendy,"East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. 
"
12,13,Bebe,"As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.
"
12,13,Kyle,"Aw man.
"
12,13,Class,"Don't sweat what you might get by assuming the other side as a threat
"
12,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, you kids. 
"
12,13,Class,"Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.
"
12,13,Bridon,"East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free.
"
12,13,Wendy,"We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair. 
"
12,13,"Bridon, Wendy","Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.
"
12,13,Class,"East siiide, west siiide, east siiide...
"
12,13,Cartman,"God this sucks!
"
12,13,Jimmy,"Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan?
"
12,13,Stan,"I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
"
12,13,Jimmy,"M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel. Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-
"
12,13,Stan,"Stop. 
"
12,13,Jimmy,"All righty then.
"
12,13,Stan,"Uh, Wendy?
"
12,13,Wendy,"Hey Stan.
"
12,13,Stan,"Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.
"
12,13,Wendy,"What?
"
12,13,Stan,"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.
"
12,13,Wendy,"Stan, that's ridiculous.
"
12,13,Stan,"It is?
"
12,13,Wendy,"I would never leave you for Bridon.
"
12,13,Stan,"Really?
"
12,13,Wendy,"No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. 
"
12,13,Jimmy,"There you go. Feel better, p-pal? 
"
12,13,Stan,"What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!
"
12,13,Kids,"Awww. 
"
12,13,Stan,"No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.
"
12,13,Kids,"Awww. 
"
12,13,Butters,"Awww jeez, you're no fun. 
"
12,13,Bebe,"Hey Bridon.
"
12,13,Bridon,"Hey.
"
12,13,Lola,"Hi Bridon
"
12,13,Bridon,"Hi.
"
12,13,"Heidi, Millie","Hey Bridon.
"
12,13,Bridon,"Hey.
"
12,13,Stan,"Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.
"
12,13,Bridon,"Huh?
"
12,13,Stan,"Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
"
12,13,Bridon,"They are?
"
12,13,Stan,"Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.
"
12,13,Bridon,"I don't blame 'em. All that singing and dancing? I can't stand it.
"
12,13,Stan,"You don't like doing it?
"
12,13,Bridon,"It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.
"
12,13,Stan,"Basketball?
"
12,13,Bridon,"I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
"
12,13,Stan,"Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!
"
12,13,Bridon,"I can't.
"
12,13,Stan,"Yes, you can. What's stopping you?
"
12,13,Bridon,"It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me.
"
12,13,Stan,"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!
"
12,13,Bridon,"Really?
"
12,13,Stan,"When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.
"
12,13,Bridon,"You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. 
"
12,13,Stan,"Sweet.
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"Sit up properly, Bridon. You know how strict your father is about posture.  All right dear, dinner's ready!
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Okay, let's eat!
"
12,13,Bridon,"Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Ooo, that sounds emotional!  What is it son? What's on your mind? Whatever it is, you know your dad has the time.
"
12,13,Bridon,"No, Dad, can we just talk?
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"If you can talk it, you can sing it.  You can lay down the rhythm and bring it! Just put a melody to the words that you're sayin' and sing the beat-
"
12,13,Bridon,"Dad, I want to join the basketball team. 
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"What did you say?
"
12,13,Bridon,"This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Basketball? No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!
"
12,13,Bridon,"But Dad, it's what I really want.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"There's no singing and dancing in basketball!
"
12,13,Bridon,"I know. That's kind of why I like it.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Don't you even think about it! If I had a jock for a son, I'd be the laughingstock of the men's choir club.
"
12,13,Bridon,"It's my life, Dad!
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Don't make me slap you!  I will slap your face so super hard...  I am the man of this house! You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"Maybe you should let him try it.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"What did you say, woman?!
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"You aren't being fair.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"That's it! I'm gonna slap you!
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"No, please.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"I slap you!
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"Ahh!
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"I slap you!
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"Ohh!
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"I slap slap slap you!
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"Dohh!
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Slapping you slapping you silly 'cause you disrespected me.
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"Ooohohoo.
"
12,13,Cartman,"You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
"
12,13,Kyle,"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
"
12,13,Cartman,"Fuck you, Kyle! 
"
12,13,Kids,"And you know, we're together at school again.
"
12,13,Jimmy,"School again.
"
12,13,Stan,"Aww!
"
12,13,Kids,"With all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever.
"
12,13,Cartman,"Oh God, shut up!
"
12,13,Kids,"Together at school again. What a special day.
"
12,13,Cartman,"Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
"
12,13,Kids,"We could say that neverrrrrrrrrrr
Goes away.
"
12,13,Stan,"Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!
"
12,13,Bridon,"Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom.
"
12,13,Stan,"Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.
"
12,13,Mr. Garrett,"Really?
"
12,13,Bridon,"Look, I should be getting to class.
"
12,13,Mr. Garrett,"Hey, we sure could use you, kid. I could never find enough kids that wanna play ball. All the kids and the school funding go to the theater department.
"
12,13,Stan,"You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.
"
12,13,Bridon,"I don't know...
"
12,13,Mr. Garrett,"Look, just come in at recess and shoot some ball with the team.
"
12,13,Stan,"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
"
12,13,Bridon,"Okay.
"
12,13,Mr. Garrett,"Aayy, that's great, Bridon.
"
12,13,Bridon,"Thanks.
"
12,13,Jason,"We might have a chance at winning now. 
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Bridon! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Bupow! Bupow! Bupow!
"
12,13,Bridon,"Dad, I was just messin' around.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there! You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!
"
12,13,Mr. Garrett,"Eh, your kid is really good at this.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole! 
"
12,13,Mr. Garrett,"Just... go easy on him, huh?
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"You know what this means? It means you're about to get slapped, so you'd better shut up!
"
12,13,Mr. Garrett,"If he wants to play ball, you should let him.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"I'll do it! I'll slap the shit out of you!
"
12,13,Mr. Garrett,"He's just a kid.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"You don't tell me how to raise my son! I'll slap it again. 
"
12,13,Bridon,"Dad, stop!
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself  There, there's another slap! Maybe you'll think next time you act, you-  Slap it, I'll slap it! 
"
12,13,Bridon,"Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Shut up, Bridon! 
"
12,13,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Get out of my way, Mackey. You wanna piece of this?!  I'll slap everyone in this God damned school if I have to! 
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"You are never going to play shooting hoops, do you understand?!  You are going to sing and dance and be the best at it!
"
12,13,Bridon,"You're hurting my arm.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Stupid-ass boy!
"
12,13,Stan,"Ah, shit.
"
12,13,Cartman,"Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.
"
12,13,Stan,"You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
"
12,13,Kyle,"What? Are you crazy?
"
12,13,Cartman,"No way dude.
"
12,13,Kyle,"We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
"
12,13,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
12,13,Stan,"I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.
"
12,13,Scott,"What's so bad about hanging out with me?
"
12,13,Cartman,"Shut up, Scott Malkinson. ""I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.""
"
12,13,Scott,"Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!
"
12,13,Cartman,"""Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."" 
"
12,13,Stan,"You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
"
12,13,Kyle,"Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
"
12,13,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
12,13,Stan,"That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
"
12,13,Scott,"Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.
"
12,13,Cartman,"""That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes.""
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Yadada yadada yadada dadadadada High School Musical is so awesome. 
"
12,13,Male CPS Agent,"Mister... Gueermo?
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"What?
"
12,13,Male CPS Agent,"We're from Child Protective Services.  There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child?
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"What? Who the hell's been saying that?!
"
12,13,Female CPS Agent,"We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous.
"
12,13,Male CPS Agent,"His name is Stan Marsh.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"You'd better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car, 'cause there's a world o'hurt about to come your way!
"
12,13,Male CPS Agent,"Mr. Gueermo, we need to come in and have a word with your son.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Oh, by all means. You got the balls to come in here?! Do it! Do it! 
"
12,13,Male CPS Agent,"Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly.  We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes if that's okay and just maybe... 
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Yeah! There it is! Slapped you! You probably think I'm finished, huh?!  No, there's another one!
"
12,13,Female CPS Agent,"Oh my God!
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you!  There's a slap for you!  Slap, slap, slap!  Yeah, there you go!  Here's a little reach around the back of the head slap! 
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"Oh God, please, you have to get away! He won't ever stop! 
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Awww. I'm going slap-happy!  I'm going slap, slap happy! Slappity slappin' you, teachin' you a lesson for coming in my house!  What are you looking at, Robertson? 
"
12,13,Bebe,"They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! 
"
12,13,Butters,"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. 
"
12,13,Clyde,"Who's the male lead?
"
12,13,Butters,"No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 
"
12,13,Wendy,"Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together.
"
12,13,Bridon,"Yeah, great.
"
12,13,Stan,"God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now?

Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"You hear the rhythm. Now is the time, the tiiiiime. It's time to go to bed. It's time to call it a day. You can reach the stars and-
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"Oh please. You have to do something.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"What are you interrupting me for?!
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"It's our son, he's- he's running away.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"What?!  What's going on here, what's this all about?  What do you think you're doing?
"
12,13,Bridon,"Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Nono! Sing it!
"
12,13,Bridon,"No! I'm sick of singing!
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Can you believe it? What'd he just say? What's the matter with kids these days? 
"
12,13,Mrs. Gueermo,"Kids these days.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Kids these days!  Unh unh unh! Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!
"
12,13,Bridon,"Just let me go.
"
12,13,Mr. Gueermo,"Go ahead. Make my day.  You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red hand prints all over face!  Ow!  Oh my God, what was that?  Did you see that?! Oh my God it hurts so bad!  Ow. What the ""H"" is going on?! 
"
12,13,Kyle,"Well, I had to see it to believe it!
"
12,13,Cartman,"I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
"
12,13,Stan,"Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.
"
12,13,Kyle,"We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
"
12,13,Kenny,"(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)
"
12,13,Stan,"Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
"
12,13,Kyle,"You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
"
12,13,Stan,"Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
"
12,13,Scott,"'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-
"
12,13,Cartman,"You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
"
12,13,Stan,"Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
"
12,13,Cartman,"That's a low blow, Stan.
"
12,13,Mr. Mackey,"Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows.
"
12,13,Mr. Garrett,"All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon?
"
12,13,Bridon,"I'm ready, coach.
"
12,13,Mr. Garrett,"Give 'em hell! 
"
12,13,Mr. Mackey,"Just a minute to go in the first quarter. 
"
12,13,Bebe,"Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?
"
12,13,Bridon,"I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.
"
12,13,Wendy,"You gave it up?
"
12,13,Stan,"That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball
"
12,13,Cartman,"But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
"
12,13,Stan,"Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
"
12,13,Boys,"You've gotta do what you wanna do. Even if other people don't really want you to.
True, girl, you know it's true,  that the thing you wanna do is the thing that you should do.
"
12,13,Kyle,"Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
"
12,13,Cartman,"And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- 
"
12,13,Boys,"Do what you wanna do.
Just make sure that what you're doing is what's cool and popular with everyone
Chew, baby, chew and chew.
When you're eating jerky, if eating jerky is what you wanna do.
"
12,13,Bebe,"Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?
"
12,13,Bridon,"Uhh, sure. 
"
12,13,Kyle,"Do what you want, don't have restraint.
"
12,13,Cartman,"Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
"
12,13,Kenny,"(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)
"
12,13,Stan,"Try to do what you wanna do!
"
12,13,Boys,"Do what you wanna do.
As long as what you wanna do is what everybody wants you to.
Glue, baby, buy some glue
Just in case if what you're doin' 
"
12,13,Stan,"involves needing scissors and glue!
"
12,13,Scott,"Hey guys. Hey guys! 
"
12,13,Stan,"Huh? 
"
12,13,Kyle,"Where did everybody go?
"
12,13,Scott,"The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.
"
12,13,Stan,"But the girls like singing and dancing.
"
12,13,Scott,"No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does.
"
12,13,Stan,"But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.
"
12,14,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in ""x = y + 1"". Mkay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen.
"
12,14,Cartman,"Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. 
"
12,14,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, now right-click on menu item ""Equate O"" and type in ""input y"".
"
12,14,Kyle,"Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 
"
12,14,Stan,"No, I'm on the Japanese side.
"
12,14,Cartman,"Oh, who just shot me? 
"
12,14,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right...  uhhh, but then what the hell is the...?  Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay.
"
12,14,Cartman,"U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
"
12,14,Stan,"Dude, what?
"
12,14,Butters,"There's vampires in the school!
"
12,14,Stan,"What?
"
12,14,Butters,"Vampires. I've seen them.
"
12,14,Stan,"Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!
"
12,14,Red,"Not a cheat if you rank up.
"
12,14,Butters,"Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
"
12,14,Kyle,"Butters, there's no such things as vampires.
"
12,14,Butters,"But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
"
12,14,Cartman,"All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
"
12,14,Butters,"Really? Do you think that's best?
"
12,14,Cartman,"Yeah, now get out of here.
"
12,14,Butters,"All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
"
12,14,Cartman,"Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
"
12,14,Lead Vampire,"Isn't this cool? This time of day nobody's in the gym. We should make this one of our official South Park Vampires Club hangouts.
"
12,14,Spiky Vampire,"That's an awesome new coat, Mike. Totally badass.
"
12,14,Vampir,"Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now.
"
12,14,Spiky Vampire,"Oh, that's cool.
"
12,14,Midnight Vampire,"I'm gonna change my name to Vladimir.
"
12,14,Vampir,"You can't; it's too close to Vampir. 
"
12,14,Butters,"12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
"
12,14,Sparkly Vampire,"You know that girl Bella in Twilight? I think I'm like her. I'm a psi vampire. Do you like the sparkles I got?
"
12,14,Butters,"Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.
"
12,14,Vampir,"Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se.
"
12,14,Spiky Vampire,"Hehyeah, I'm gonna be a hybrid vampire, both psi and sanguinarian.
"
12,14,Butters,"That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
"
12,14,Bloodrayne,"Lunchtime's almost over. Should we drink some more blood?
"
12,14,Other Vampires,"Yeah! Cool!
"
12,14,Vampir,"Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se. 
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 
"
12,14,Tape,"Toot toododoo!  It's the Big Texas Butters show! And now here he is, Big Texas Butters! Why howdy there, partners. I'm Biiig Texas Butters. And this is my horse, Toast. Happy Trails, to youuu.  AAHHH.
"
12,14,Vampir,"Ummm, what are you doing?
"
12,14,Butters,"Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!
"
12,14,Bloodrayne,"That kid was really scared of us.
"
12,14,Vampir,"That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se.
"
12,14,Spiky Vampire,"Heeyeah, we're cool, huh? 
"
12,14,Pete,"What the hell are those kids doing?
"
12,14,Henrietta,"Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?
"
12,14,Pete,"Are they trying to be Goth?
"
12,14,Michael,"No, they're vamp. They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice.
"
12,14,Henrietta,"But they can't dress like that. That's our style.
"
12,14,Midnight Vampire,"Hey, Tommy Petros is thinking he might wanna be a Vamp kid too.
"
12,14,Vampir,"Tommy Petros? Is he cool?
"
12,14,Bloodrayne,"Yeah, he's cool enough.
"
12,14,Vampir,"All right. 
"
12,14,Pete,"So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?
"
12,14,Vampir,"We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se.
"
12,14,Michael,"Aren't you Mike Makowski?
"
12,14,Vampir,"That's Vampir Makowski now.
"
12,14,Henrietta,"You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!
"
12,14,Sparkly Vampire,"Hey, we're just as dark as you guys, maybe darker!
"
12,14,Pete,"Really. Do you guys even smoke?
"
12,14,Vampir,"Of course not. Smoking's bad for you.
"
12,14,Other Vamps,"Yeah.
"
12,14,Pete,"Oh my Gohhd.
"
12,14,Vampir,"You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se.
"
12,14,Pete,"All right, Count Fagula, you just do that. 
"
12,14,Butters,"Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
"
12,14,Linda,"Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh no, what did I do this time?
"
12,14,Linda,"You just march on in there.
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh Jeez...
"
12,14,Stephen,"You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?!  It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?!  Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!
"
12,14,Butters,"I have no idea, sir.
"
12,14,Stephen,"I'll tell you why!  Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!
"
12,14,Butters,"Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-
"
12,14,Stephen,"What keeps a family together, Butters?!
"
12,14,Butters,"A well-organized pantry.
"
12,14,Stephen,"That's right!  If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!
"
12,14,Butters,"Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
"
12,14,Stephen,"You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!
"
12,14,Butters,"Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 
"
12,14,Vampir,"...All mortals share a soft repose,
My soul doth dreadful vigils keep,
More keen than which hell scarcely knows.
"
12,14,Sparkly Vampire,"What is that kid doing?
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.
"
12,14,Vampir,"So?
"
12,14,Butters,"O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
"
12,14,Vampir,"What?
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.
"
12,14,Cowlick Vampire,"You're not cool enough to be one of us.
"
12,14,Butters,"Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
"
12,14,Vampir,"We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.
"
12,14,Butters,"Yes! Yes, anything else?
"
12,14,Midnight Vampire,"I want some Cheetos.
"
12,14,Butters,"Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
"
12,14,Singer,"I'm not part of your society. I don't follow your fads and rules. Doctrines...
"
12,14,Boy 1,"Where did it go? Do you see where it went?
"
12,14,Boy 2,"Yeah, it's right over there by those vampire kids. 
"
12,14,Pete,"What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!
"
12,14,Boy 1,"Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?
"
12,14,Michael,"So lame. So... Lame...
"
12,14,Henrietta,"You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.
"
12,14,Michael,"Sooo lame! 
"
12,14,Little Vamp,"See? Isn't it cool back here? It's all dark and isolated.
"
12,14,Shades Vamp,"This would be a great place for a Vampire meeting.
"
12,14,Henrietta,"Get out of our space, you little twerps!
"
12,14,Pete,"More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?
"
12,14,Butters,"I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
"
12,14,Vampir,"You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?
"
12,14,Butters,"Yeah, I guess.
"
12,14,Vampir,"Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave.
"
12,14,Butters,"Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
"
12,14,Vampir,"Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin!  This way. Prepare thyself. 
"
12,14,Butters,"Whoa.
"
12,14,Vampir,"And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se!  With this thy transformation is done. 
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. 
"
12,14,Vampir,"It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires. 
"
12,14,Stephen,"There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?! 
"
12,14,Linda,"Butters, what have you done to your hair? 
"
12,14,Stephen,"Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister! 
"
12,14,Butters,"I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
"
12,14,Linda,"What on Earth?
"
12,14,Stephen,"That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!
"
12,14,Butters,"You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
"
12,14,Stephen,"All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna-  Ah!
"
12,14,Linda,"Butters? 
"
12,14,Butters,"I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 
"
12,14,Principal Victoria,"Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this ""vampire"" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.
"
12,14,Pete,"...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.
"
12,14,Michael,"We aren't vampires.
"
12,14,Principal Victoria,"I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the ""in"" thing right now, but-
"
12,14,Pete,"We aren't trying to be popular!
"
12,14,Principal Victoria,"-but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. 
"
12,14,Mr. Mackey,"Here's a couple more, Principal Victoria, hm'kay.
"
12,14,Vampir,"Oh, oh no, are we in trouble?
"
12,14,Principal Victoria,"I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-
"
12,14,Michael,"We aren't friends!
"
12,14,Vampir,"Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se.
"
12,14,Michael,"Allison Merch is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop.
"
12,14,Pete,"Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. 
"
12,14,Pete,"Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. 
"
12,14,Boy 1,"It went this way?
"
12,14,Boy 3,"Yeah, it's over there by that fat girl, the big-nosed kid, the midget, and the kid with pock marks on his face. 
"
12,14,Michael,"So we're back to that, are we?
"
12,14,Firkle,"Shit.
"
12,14,Pete,"Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.
"
12,14,Butters,"Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
"
12,14,Cartman,"Butters?  Butters?! 
"
12,14,Butters,"I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
"
12,14,Cartman,"Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
"
12,14,Butters,"I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
"
12,14,Cartman,"Dude! 
"
12,14,Liane,"You all right, sweetie?
"
12,14,Butters,"U-huh.  Ow.
"
12,14,Liane,"What's going on?
"
12,14,Cartman,"Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
"
12,14,Liane,"Oh dear.
"
12,14,Cartman,"Yes.
"
12,14,Michael,"I walked into the cafeteria today. Rebecca Miller and Philip Russ were dressed like vampires drinking Clamato juice with four kids from the football team.
"
12,14,Firkle,"Jesus.
"
12,14,Pete,"It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening. I mean, why now?
"
12,14,Michael,"Doesn't matter why. Pretty soon, the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happy-go-lucky vampire wannabes.
"
12,14,Henrietta,"It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.
"
12,14,Pete,"Whattaya mean?
"
12,14,Henrietta,"I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.
"
12,14,Pete,"Does your mom know you took her car?
"
12,14,Henrietta,"Do I care?
"
12,14,Michael,"All right, this is probably good enough.
"
12,14,Pete,"Yeah, pull over here. 
"
12,14,Vampir,"(Please, what do you want?! Let me go!)
"
12,14,Michael,"What should we do with him?
"
12,14,Pete,"Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.
"
12,14,Vampir,"(No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)
"
12,14,Michael,"What's that?
"
12,14,Vampir,"(I'm not really a vampire.)
"
12,14,Michael,"You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked. 
"
12,14,Pete,"If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way.
"
12,14,Michael,"How about we send him to Transylvania?
"
12,14,Pete,"No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.
"
12,14,Henrietta,"If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.
"
12,14,Goths,"Scottsdale.
"
12,14,Linda,"Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?  Unbelievable! He's locked the door. 
"
12,14,Stephen,"Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey!  Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!
"
12,14,Butters,"What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
"
12,14,Stephen,"Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  One! Two!  Uhh, Bu-Butters?
"
12,14,Butters,"Hey Dad. 
"
12,14,Stephen,"AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!
"
12,14,Butters,"I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
"
12,14,Stephen,"All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!
"
12,14,Butters,"Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
"
12,14,Linda,"Stephen, what has happened to our boy?
"
12,14,Stephen,"He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground.
"
12,14,Michael,"I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires.
"
12,14,Henrietta,"He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.
"
12,14,Waitress,"Hey you kids gonna order any food or just sit there and drink coffee all night again? 
"
12,14,Henrietta,"Leave us alone!
"
12,14,Waitress,"Bad enough I always get stuck with you Goth kids, now I got Goth kids in my entire section. 
"
12,14,Pete,"They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!
"
12,14,Waitress,"Looks the same to me.
"
12,14,Pete,"I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.
"
12,14,Waitress,"No, they said they're too young to drink caffeine, so they're havin' orange juice. 
"
12,14,Henrietta,"Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village In from us too.
"
12,14,Pete,"Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us.
"
12,14,Butters,"Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
"
12,14,Henrietta,"Get away, douchebag.
"
12,14,Butters,"Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
"
12,14,Pete,"What are you talking about?
"
12,14,Butters,"I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
"
12,14,Pete,"Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?
"
12,14,Butters,"Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
"
12,14,Michael,"Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything.
"
12,14,Pete,"How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!
"
12,14,Henrietta,"Well, I think we all know what has to be done.
"
12,14,Michael,"Yup.
"
12,14,Pete,"Let's get to it. 
"
12,14,Singer,"Burn down down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it steal your soul away.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Light the fire. Take control.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it take your soul.
Burn down, burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
And take control.
Burn down... Hot Topic.
Burn it down... Hot Topic.
"
12,14,Clerk,"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
"
12,14,Pete,"You should probably get out of here. 
"
12,14,Spiky Vamp,"What the hell are they doing??
"
12,14,Butters,"They're putting an end to it! 
"
12,14,Clerk,"AAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
12,14,Butters,"Mom, Dad!  I changed back!
"
12,14,Stephen,"What?
"
12,14,Butters,"Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
"
12,14,Linda,"We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.
"
12,14,Stephen,"That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.
"
12,14,Butters,"What's that, Dad?
"
12,14,Stephen,"Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!
"
12,14,Butters,"Uh oh.
"
12,14,Stephen,"Butters, you are grounded!
"
12,14,Butters,"Ahh, dangit! 
"
12,14,Stephen,"It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more. 
"
12,14,Pete,"Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's ""fun"", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. 
"
12,14,Michael,"Fuck all of you.
"
