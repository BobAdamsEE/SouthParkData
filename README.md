# SouthParkData
.csv files containing script information including: season, episode, character, &amp; line.

The data was captured by downloading html files from http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Portal:Scripts and then pulling the relevant data from the script table.  Some manual clean up has been done (ex. fixing typos and formatting issues).
