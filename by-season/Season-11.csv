11,1,Announcer,"And now back to Wheel of Fortune!
"
11,1,Pat Sajak,"All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round!
"
11,1,Randy,"Thanks, Pat!
"
11,1,Pat Sajak,"You've got some family here watching tonight. 
"
11,1,Randy,"Yeah, they're all rooting for me.
"
11,1,Pat Sajak,"And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home?
"
11,1,Randy,"Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!
"
11,1,Jimbo,"That's us!
"
11,1,Stephen,"Hehey! 
"
11,1,Man 1,"Hey Randy!
"
11,1,Jimbo,"Good luck!
"
11,1,Pat Sajak,"Well let's see if you can't make everyone proud. The category is  People Who Annoy You.
"
11,1,Randy,"Okay. 
"
11,1,Pat Sajak,"As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E.  We just need three more consonants, and a vowel.
"
11,1,Randy,"Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
"
11,1,Pat Sajak,"And a vowel?
"
11,1,Randy,"An O please.
"
11,1,Pat Sajak,"Okay, well, looks like you're gonna get a lot of help here.  The category is People Who Annoy You.  Audience, keep quiet, please. 
"
11,1,Randy,"Uh... Well, uh...
"
11,1,Pat Sajak,"Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh.
"
11,1,Randy,"I know it but I don't think I should say it.
"
11,1,Pat Sajak,"Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.
"
11,1,Randy,"Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Niggers!  Huh?  Ohhh...
"
11,1,Stan,"Oooo. 
"
11,1,Randy,"Oh naggers. Of course, naggers.  Right.
"
11,1,Pat Sajak,"Uhh, can we cut to a... Can we cut to a- 
"
11,1,Randy,"Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?
"
11,1,Sharon,"I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.
"
11,1,Randy,"What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
"
11,1,Kyle,"Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
"
11,1,Cartman,"Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
"
11,1,Stan,"Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
"
11,1,Cartman,"Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.
"
11,1,Stan,"No he's not.  Is he?
"
11,1,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
11,1,Stan,"I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-
"
11,1,Token,"Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning in the news.
"
11,1,Stan,"Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
"
11,1,Token,"Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Ohhhhhhhh?
"
11,1,Token,"It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! 
"
11,1,Stan,"Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
"
11,1,Token,"That's easy for you to say, Stan.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Yeah, come on! Here we go!
"
11,1,Stan,"Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
"
11,1,Token,"That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Race war! Come on! Race war!
"
11,1,Token,"If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not ""fighting"" anybody. 
"
11,1,Cartman,"Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
"
11,1,Randy,"I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. 
"
11,1,Jesse Jackson,"The puzzle you were solving was ""people who annoy you"".
"
11,1,Randy,"Uh well, like anybody else thought it was ""naggers"". I mean, right?
"
11,1,Jesse Jackson,"Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists.
"
11,1,Randy,"Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans.
"
11,1,Jesse Jackson,"Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?
"
11,1,Randy,"Y-Yes, absolutely.
"
11,1,Jesse Jackson,"Very well. If you want to apologize, I will accept. 
"
11,1,Randy,"Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you.
"
11,1,Jesse Jackson,"Brian, get a picture of Mr. Marsh apologizing. 
"
11,1,Brian,"Ready to go, sir.
"
11,1,Jesse Jackson,"Kiss it.
"
11,1,Randy,"Huh?
"
11,1,Jesse Jackson,"Apologize. Kiss it.
"
11,1,Randy,"You want me to kiss your-
"
11,1,Jesse Jackson,"That's right.  Apologize.
"
11,1,Randy,"Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh...
"
11,1,Jesse Jackson,"Apologize. 
"
11,1,Stan,"Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
"
11,1,Token,"Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.
"
11,1,Stan,"Well, yeah.
"
11,1,Token,"You just don't get it, Stan!
"
11,1,Stan,"Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!
"
11,1,Token,"Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! 
"
11,1,Stan,"He told my dad he was...
"
11,1,Woman,"Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words.  In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself a little person. Who knows what a little person is?  Yes? Over here?
"
11,1,Butters,"A midget?
"
11,1,Woman,"Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"Good morning, students! How are we all feeling today?  I would like to share with you all my-
"
11,1,Cartman,"No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude! 
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"That, that words are like bullets. And if you give-
"
11,1,Cartman,"Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...
"
11,1,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, be quiet!
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"No, no, it's okay. He'll run out of steam here pretty soon. 
"
11,1,Cartman,"Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. 
"
11,1,Comedian,"So I said to my wife, ""You told me to kill the damned cockroach! Don't yell at me for making a mess!""  We've got a great crowd here tonight. Now, how many people are actually from Colorado?  Ya got nothin' better to do on a Friday night than to go to a comedy club, huh?  Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?  Yeah. I know you. You're the guy that said ""nigger"" on Wheel of Fortune.  Look! Everybody! It's the ""nigger"" guy. 
"
11,1,Man 2,"Hey, it is him.
"
11,1,Comedian,"Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave to the ""nigger"" guy.  Say, ""Hi, 'nigger' guy!""
"
11,1,Randy,"Hi, ""nigger"" guy! 
"
11,1,Comedian,"That's all right, ""nigger"" guy. You know we're just playin'. 
"
11,1,Randy,"Yeah... No problem...
"
11,1,Comedian,"Have you all seen these navigation systems in these cars these days? Damn things look like they're straight out of ""Far Out Space Nuts"". Maybe ""nigger"" guy has one. You got one, ""nigger"" guy? 
"
11,1,Man 3,"Hey look, Betty. It's that ""nigger"" guy. 
"
11,1,Three kids,"Nigger guy. Nigger guy. 
"
11,1,Clerk,"Hey. What do you think you're doing? 
"
11,1,Randy,"I just... need some aspirin.
"
11,1,Clerk,"You aren't welcome in this store, ""nigger"" guy.
"
11,1,Randy,"Fine! 
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"Principal Victoria, I'm very concerned about the behavior of one of your students.
"
11,1,Principal Victoria,"Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"Why? I don't feel terrible. It doesn't bother me at all.  Words are like bullets, and I let 'em pass right through me.  I just know that with some one-on-one time together with this Eric Cartman, I have a chance to change the way he thinks.
"
11,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay?
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"You don't understand.  You see, words are like bullets. And if you take away the gunpowder-
"
11,1,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson.
"
11,1,Principal Victoria,"Very well, Mr. Nelson.  Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman.  Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings? 
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! 
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Barely! 
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"No matter how you act, I can rise above it!
"
11,1,Cartman,"""Rise above it!"" Get it? Like he can rise above anything! 
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"Shut your fucking mouth!
"
11,1,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Nelson! 
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking
"
11,1,Cartman,"Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"Aaaaaaa!
"
11,1,Randy,"Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say ""Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy.""  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! ""Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy!"" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just ""Nigger Guy"".  Respect. 
"
11,1,Stan,"Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that ""little person"" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.
"
11,1,Token,"Sooo black people are midgets. 
"
11,1,Stan,"God dammit!
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"Excuse me: over here, please? All right, I need all students to join me over here. 
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, ""Hello, fatso!""
"
11,1,Craig,"...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"He has to learn his lesson! You see, words are like bullets.  All right all right, here he comes. 
"
11,1,Kids,"""Hello, fatso!""
"
11,1,Cartman,"Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"Now you know how it feels.  You didn't like it when the tables were turned, did ya?
"
11,1,Cartman,"Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"You can't get to me! Words are like bullets!
"
11,1,Randy,"And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the ""nigger"" guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on ""Wheel of Fortune"", you know and... and when people call me... ""nigger guy""... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. 
"
11,1,Black Man,"Is this ""nigger"" guy serious?
"
11,1,Randy,"Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! 
"
11,1,Driver,"Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!
"
11,1,Skeeter,"Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy! 
"
11,1,Randy,"Awww! Awwww! 
"
11,1,Skeeter,"Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.
"
11,1,Passenger,"Wooo! 
"
11,1,Randy,"Whoa! 
"
11,1,Skeeter,"Where you goin' ""nigger"" guy?
"
11,1,Randy,"Please I, I don't want any trouble.
"
11,1,Skeeter,"Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on ""Wheel of Fortune""!
"
11,1,Driver,"Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, ""nigger"" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance.
"
11,1,Passenger,"You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im!
"
11,1,Randy,"What do you want?
"
11,1,Skeeter,"What do we want?  We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans!
"
11,1,Man 4,"Leave him alone.
"
11,1,Passenger,"Hey... That's that other ""nigger"" guy.
"
11,1,Skeeter,"Huh?
"
11,1,Passenger,"That's the guy from Seinfeld, used the N-word a whole bunch o' times.
"
11,1,Driver,"Michael Richards? Huh well, son of a bitch!
"
11,1,Skeeter,"Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us two ""nigger"" guys!
"
11,1,Man 5,"Make that three.
"
11,1,Passenger,"Mark Fuhrman?
"
11,1,Skeeter,"Who?
"
11,1,Passenger,"He done said the N-word in the O.J. case.
"
11,1,Driver,"Well what is this? A ""nigger"" guy convention? 
"
11,1,Richards,"We aren't being pushed around anymore. Leave.
"
11,1,Driver,"Come on, Skeeter.  These ""nigger"" guys ain't worth our trouble.
"
11,1,Skeeter,"Damn ""nigger"" guys!  We'll be back! 
"
11,1,Richards,"You'd better come with us.
"
11,1,Richards,"Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee.
"
11,1,Randy,"What's going on here?
"
11,1,Fuhrman,"We've been following your story since we first saw it on the news. Don't worry - you're with friends now. Dale here used the N-word in a racial joke at work. Scott used the plural N-word to refer to a group of gardeners who broke his fence.
"
11,1,Scott,"They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.
"
11,1,Richards,"We're all just like you.
"
11,1,Randy,"No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.
"
11,1,Richards,"I made a mistake too.  I was trying to be funny! I got frustrated and thought I would get some shock laughs. I'm just... not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth.
"
11,1,Randy,"You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
"
11,1,Richards,"You really think that matters?!  You really think all those people out there see a difference? Oh, they might say your racial slur was more accidental; they might even laugh about it. But at the end of the day, all you are to them is just another damned ""nigger"" guy!  Oh, you don't like that, do ya?
"
11,1,Randy,"No.
"
11,1,Fuhrman,"Randy, we want you to join us. We have a plan to make this all go away once and for all.
"
11,1,Stan,"Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
"
11,1,Token,"I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!
"
11,1,Stan,"I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
"
11,1,Token,"No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!
"
11,1,Stan,"What the hell do you want from me?! 
"
11,1,Token,"Nothing!
"
11,1,Stan,"Then stop being mad!
"
11,1,Token,"No!
"
11,1,Butters,"Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 
"
11,1,Butters,"All right, Eric, come on, Eric.
"
11,1,Kyle,"Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
"
11,1,Cartman,"It's a midget, dude.
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. 
"
11,1,Randy,"Senators, I know it is not normally considered ""American"" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term ""nigger guy"".
"
11,1,Senator 1,"""Nigger guy""?
"
11,1,Randy,"Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
"
11,1,Richards,"Yeah! That's right!
"
11,1,Randy,"Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
"
11,1,Skeeter,"Goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!
"
11,1,Randy,"Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called ""nigger guys""? 
"
11,1,Senator 2,"Uhhh, hold on a second, are you suggesting that ""nigger guy"" could become a slur that refers to all white people?
"
11,1,Senator 3,"I'm certainly not a nigger guy. I've never thought a racist thought.
"
11,1,Senator 4,"Aw, come on, you're the biggest nigger guy in Washington.
"
11,1,Senator 1,"Mr. Marsh, we see now the importance of your bill.  All those in favor to ban the term ""nigger guy""?
"
11,1,Most Senators,"Aye!
"
11,1,Senator 1,"Opposed?
"
11,1,Senator 4,"Nay?
"
11,1,Senator 1,"The motion is passed! 
"
11,1,Randy,"We did it!
"
11,1,Field Reporter,"For the first time in American history, a word has been officially banned from use.
"
11,1,Senator 3,"From now on, if a person uses the word ""nigger,"" it must be at least seven words away from the word ""guy."" 
"
11,1,Field Reporter,"Tom, it appears that the nigger guy epidemic is ove-  Oh dammit I said it, didn't I?
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"AAAA! Ow! Ow! Okay!  Okay, you win!
"
11,1,Cartman,"Say ""Uncle!""
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"Ung-cle!
"
11,1,Cartman,"Hahaha, now say ""Caroline, don't go into the light!""
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"Caroline, don't go into the light!
"
11,1,Cartman,"Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!
"
11,1,Mr. Nelson,"There! Now you all see that I am not limited by my size.  I have proven my point! My work here is done! 
"
11,1,Stan,"What was his point?
"
11,1,Kyle,"I have no idea.
"
11,1,Stan,"Dude, I don't get it.
"
11,1,Kyle,"I don't get it either.
"
11,1,Stan,"Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
"
11,1,Kyle,"...Huh?
"
11,1,Stan,"Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.
"
11,1,Token,"Now you get it, Stan. 
"
11,1,Stan,"Yeah. I totally don't get it.
"
11,1,Token,"Thanks, dude.
"
11,2,Cartman,"This picture I like to call ""The Pierre"". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture ""The Sleeping Menstrual"".  This one, I call ""Hot Fudge Mondae"".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
"
11,2,Kyle,"Is this all you brought us here to see?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it ""New Moon Rising"".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
"
11,2,Kyle,"Butters is staying over tonight?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
"
11,2,Butters,"Hey, fellas! 
"
11,2,Cartman,"Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.
"
11,2,Butters,"Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
"
11,2,Cartman,"No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?
"
11,2,Stan,"Come on, let's go. 
"
11,2,Kyle,"Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.
"
11,2,Butters,"Yeah Kyle?
"
11,2,Kyle,"Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Kyyyle!
"
11,2,Butters,"Uh what do you mean?
"
11,2,Kyle,"I mean, that if-
"
11,2,Cartman,"What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
"
11,2,Butters,"Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.
"
11,2,Kyle,"Hrrugh! 
"
11,2,Butters,"So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
"
11,2,Butters,"But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
"
11,2,Cartman,"You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
"
11,2,Stan,"What'cha do to Butters this time?
"
11,2,Cartman,"It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 
"
11,2,Kyle,"Dude!
"
11,2,Cartman,"I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!
"
11,2,Stan,"Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Because that makes Butters gay now!
"
11,2,Kyle,"No dude, that makes you gay!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Eh- ...what?
"
11,2,Kyle,"You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Nuh uh.
"
11,2,Kyle,"Yeah huh!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
"
11,2,Kenny,"(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)
"
11,2,Cartman,"But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
"
11,2,Stan,"You are now.
"
11,2,Cartman,"No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
"
11,2,Kyle,"Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
"
11,2,Cartman,"No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?
"
11,2,Stan,"You can't!
"
11,2,Kyle,"Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
"
11,2,Cartman,"How?
"
11,2,Kyle,"The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Really?
"
11,2,Kyle,"Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
"
11,2,Cartman,"...Shit, I gotta find Butters! 
"
11,2,Kyle,"...Idiot.
"
11,2,Butters,"Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 
"
11,2,Cartman,"Butters.
"
11,2,Butters,"Whoa, hey Eric.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
"
11,2,Butters,"A surprise? What is it?
"
11,2,Cartman,"It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
"
11,2,Butters,"Oh boy!
"
11,2,Cartman,"You ready?
"
11,2,Butters,"Y-yeah!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
"
11,2,Butters,"Oh, okay! 
"
11,2,Cartman,"Hang on a second here. 
"
11,2,Butters,"How come uh, I can't see?
"
11,2,Cartman,"'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 
"
11,2,Butters,"Oh uh, ho yeah.
"
11,2,Cartman,"All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.
"
11,2,Butters,"Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
"
11,2,Cartman,"...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 
"
11,2,Butters,"Well okay!
"
11,2,Cartman,"All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. 
"
11,2,Stephen,"Butters!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Uh! 
"
11,2,Butters,"Whoa! Hey Dad! 
"
11,2,Stephen,"Butters! What are you doing?!
"
11,2,Butters,"I'm getting a surprise! 
"
11,2,Stephen,"Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! 
"
11,2,Butters,"Hey. Where'd Eric go?
"
11,2,Stephen,"Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?
"
11,2,Butters,"Like what?
"
11,2,Stephen,"Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious.
"
11,2,Butters,"What's... bi-curious?
"
11,2,Stephen,"You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters. 
"
11,2,Linda,"What's going on, you two?
"
11,2,Butters,"Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. 
"
11,2,Stephen,"Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious.
"
11,2,Father Maxi,"Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused?
"
11,2,Butters,"...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.
"
11,2,Stephen,"You see?
"
11,2,Father Maxi,"Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you.
"
11,2,Butters,"Really?
"
11,2,Stephen,"What can I do, Father?
"
11,2,Father Maxi,"There is a special camp where young men who are confused, like your son, can go and be cleansed by the power of God. Many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured.
"
11,2,Stephen,"A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.
"
11,2,Butters,"Whoa boy! Camp!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
"
11,2,Kyle,"What are you talking about, fatass?
"
11,2,Cartman,"I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
"
11,2,Kyle,"You figured that out, huh?
"
11,2,Cartman,"That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. 
"
11,2,Kyle,"Except for us.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Right, except for you.
"
11,2,Kyle,"And all the people we tell.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Why would you tell anybody?
"
11,2,Stan,"Because it's really, really funny.
"
11,2,Cartman,"...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
"
11,2,Kyle,"Like what?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! 
"
11,2,Stan,"That isn't funny.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
"
11,2,Kyle,"Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.
"
11,2,Kyle,"Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! 
"
11,2,Leader,"Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters.
"
11,2,Campers,"Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters.
"
11,2,Stephen,"Thank you so much for taking him in.
"
11,2,Director,"Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be.
"
11,2,Director,"Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?
"
11,2,Butters,"Because I'm bi-curious?
"
11,2,Director,"That's right. Like all the campers here, you're confused, and you don't think there's a way out. But even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel, the truth is that with the power of Jesus Christ you can be normal. Now, just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy.  Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy.  Ryan thought he could never change. But now he's learning that with the power of Christ and prayer, he can have a whole new life.  Over this way we have the cafeteria. All the meals are served there.  Uh Bradley! How about you be Butters' accountabilibuddy?
"
11,2,Bradley,"Humble yourselves therefore under God's might hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6
"
11,2,Director,"Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
"
11,2,Butters,"I'm bi-curious.
"
11,2,Bradley,"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22.
"
11,2,Director,"That's right, Bradley. I think we're well on our way to being healed.  We've got another one: Room 22.
"
11,2,Staffer,"Aw, darnit!
"
11,2,Stan,"Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 
"
11,2,Kyle,"Okay, my turn. 
"
11,2,Cartman,"Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
"
11,2,Kyle,"Where's what?
"
11,2,Cartman,"You know God damned well what!
"
11,2,Kyle,"Let go of me.
"
11,2,Stan,"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
"
11,2,Cartman,"I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!
"
11,2,Kyle,"Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Give it back, Kyle!
"
11,2,Kyle,"I don't have it!
"
11,2,Cartman,"I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!
"
11,2,Kyle,"Shut up!
"
11,2,Cartman,"You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!
"
11,2,Campers,"The Lord is love this forWith Jesus I can just say noAnd not be confused anymore.
"
11,2,Director,"We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you.
"
11,2,Butters,"He's bi-curious too?
"
11,2,Director,"Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!
"
11,2,Pastor Phillips,"Helloooo campers!  Yeth, believe it or not, I mythelf used to have unclean urges, and like a lot of you, I thought I was just made that way, that I didn't have a choice. But then I realized that God didn't want me to be that way! God wanted me to be a man!  So I buckled up in my little suit and I prayed to be normal and guess what?  It worrrrked! 
"
11,2,Director,"That's right, kids. You see, right now you're like a paper clip.  And just like a paper clip,  God needs to bend you, and shape you, and make youuuu... straight. 
"
11,2,Det. Yates,"So you say you were robbed. 
"
11,2,Cartman,"Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!
"
11,2,Det. Yates,"If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one?
"
11,2,Cartman,"It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
"
11,2,Det. Yates,"Okay, what is the picture of?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Why... why does that matter?
"
11,2,Det. Yates,"Well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is?
"
11,2,Cartman,"All right. It's a picture ...of me.
"
11,2,Det. Yates,"Yes?
"
11,2,Cartman,"It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
"
11,2,Det. Yates,"You were sucking somebody's penis. 
"
11,2,Cartman,"No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
"
11,2,Det. Yates,"...I see.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!
"
11,2,Det. Yates,"Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury.
"
11,2,Cartman,"I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
"
11,2,Det. Yates,"Well then, you're screwed.
"
11,2,Director,"You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?
"
11,2,Butters,"Well sure, I guess.
"
11,2,Bradley,"Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.
"
11,2,Director,"And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?
"
11,2,Butters,"Well yeah, sure.
"
11,2,Bradley,"So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7.
"
11,2,Director,"Then do you mind telling us why we found this  1979 Sears men's underwear catalog... in your room?
"
11,2,Bradley,"That's... that's mine.
"
11,2,Director,"You know this is strictly forbidden!
"
11,2,Butters,"Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
"
11,2,Director,"What's wrong?!  This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!
"
11,2,Butters,"Yes, it's all very confusing!
"
11,2,Director,"This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids!  Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!
"
11,2,Cartman,"That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!
"
11,2,Liane,"Eric? What's the, what's the matter? 
"
11,2,Cartman,"I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.
"
11,2,Liane,"Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
"
11,2,Liane,"Oh, now why would he do that?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
"
11,2,Liane,"What is the picture of, Eric? 
"
11,2,Cartman,"Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.
"
11,2,Liane,"Ohh, that's nice.
"
11,2,Cartman,"But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. 
"
11,2,Liane,"Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.
"
11,2,Cartman,"But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. 
"
11,2,Liane,"It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.
"
11,2,Cartman,"You, you will?
"
11,2,Butters,"...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
"
11,2,Bradley,"Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble.
"
11,2,Butters,"Awww, that's okay, Bradley.
"
11,2,Bradley,"I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused.
"
11,2,Butters,"Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
"
11,2,Bradley,"You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great.  Oh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!
"
11,2,Butters,"Wuh-what's the matter?
"
11,2,Bradley,"I think, I, I th-, I think I like you.
"
11,2,Butters,"Well I like you too, Bradley.
"
11,2,Bradley,"You do?
"
11,2,Butters,"Well yeah!
"
11,2,Bradley,"You like like me?
"
11,2,Butters,"Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 
"
11,2,Bradley,"Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves! 
"
11,2,Butters,"No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
"
11,2,Sheila,"Hello?
"
11,2,Liane,"Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother.
"
11,2,Sheila,"Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.
"
11,2,Liane,"Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.
"
11,2,Sheila,"Excuse me?
"
11,2,Liane,"Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.
"
11,2,Cartman,"It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! 
"
11,2,Liane,"You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
"
11,2,Cartman,"What?
"
11,2,Liane,"She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Mom, she's lying!
"
11,2,Liane,"She said she was sure, Eric.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
"
11,2,Liane,"Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie
"
11,2,Director,"Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!
"
11,2,Butters,"I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
"
11,2,Director,"You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk.
"
11,2,Butters,"Oh no, my Dad?
"
11,2,Director,"Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?
"
11,2,Butters,"Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
"
11,2,Director,"We're fixing your confusion!
"
11,2,Stephen,"There you are, Butters!
"
11,2,Director,"Oheh- hey Dad.
"
11,2,Stephen,"What's he done now?!
"
11,2,Director,"Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy!
"
11,2,A counselor,"They found him! They found Bradley! You'd better come quick! 
"
11,2,Director,"Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!
"
11,2,Bradley,"Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God!
"
11,2,Director,"Nono, we're fixing you!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!
"
11,2,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay students, let's all take our seats. Since it is Monday, we'll start as always with Show And Tell.  Who'd like to go first? 
"
11,2,Kyle,"Ow! Quit it, dude!
"
11,2,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first.
"
11,2,Cartman,"HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
"
11,2,Kyle,"He isn't actually going to show everyone...
"
11,2,Cartman,"And now this next picture 
"
11,2,Director,"Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you!
"
11,2,Bradley,"It's too late.
"
11,2,Butters,"Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?
"
11,2,Director,"You get back. You're only gonna make things worse.
"
11,2,Bradley,"I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!
"
11,2,Butters,"You're perfectly normal, Bradley.
"
11,2,Director,"Get back! You're just as confused as he is!
"
11,2,Butters,"All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
"
11,2,Bradley,"Yeah.
"
11,2,Butters,"I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 
"
11,2,Bradley,"I think. I think I'd like to come down now.
"
11,2,Director,"He's coming down!  We did it!  Through the power of Christ we have saved this child!
"
11,2,Stephen,"Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.
"
11,2,Butters,"No. I like bein' bi-curious.
"
11,2,Stephen,"Well you know somethin'? So do I. 
"
11,2,Butters,"Wait. Now I am confused.
"
11,2,Cartman,"And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. 
"
11,2,Bebe,"Eww!
"
11,2,Clyde,"Dude.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
"
11,2,Mrs. Garrison,"Eric, what the hell is this?!
"
11,2,Cartman,"What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
"
11,2,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother?  ""Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk."" She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? 
"
11,2,Cartman,"...Lame.
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about.
"
11,3,Cartman,"Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"No, I mean the problem of head lice.  There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver, and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here.
"
11,3,Bebe,"Somebody might have lice?
"
11,3,Class,"Ewww!
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.
"
11,3,Cartman,"Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
"
11,3,Kenny,"(What? Fuck you!)
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"I'm sure this class is clean, but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone has the lice, we can stop it before it spreads.  Lice can live in anybody's hair. 
"
11,3,Male Louse,"Hello, Kelly. How's my babih?
"
11,3,Kelly,"You mean me or the little one?
"
11,3,Male Louse,"I mean both.
"
11,3,Kelly,"Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.
"
11,3,Male Louse,"How did a louse like me get so lucky to have a louse like you?
"
11,3,Kelly,"Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.  You okay?
"
11,3,Travis,"Sometimes... I just worry what kind of world our babih is gonna grow up in.  I need to run up to the forest and do another sediment analysis. I'm worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer. 
"
11,3,Lead Screener,"All students, make sure you're in line according to your grade. When you reach the front of the line you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked. 
"
11,3,Butters,"Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
"
11,3,Stan,"What do you think happens if you do have it?
"
11,3,Cartman,"They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. 
"
11,3,Craig,"I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! 
"
11,3,Cartman,"This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
"
11,3,Kenny,"(Hey! Fuck off!) 
"
11,3,Lead Screener,"Have a seat on the stool. 
"
11,3,Lead Screener,"Uh oh, looks like you've got 'em.
"
11,3,Clyde,"What?
"
11,3,Lead Screener,"You have lice. Let's see... Clyde Harris, is it?
"
11,3,Clyde,"Oh my God. Oh Christ no!
"
11,3,Lead Screener,"Now now, it's all right. We're going to call your parents and get you to your doctor.
"
11,3,Clyde,"Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!
"
11,3,Lead Screener,"I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel.
"
11,3,Clyde,"Yes they are!
"
11,3,Travis,"Mr. President! Mr. President! I believe we have a serious problem!  The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.
"
11,3,President,"And what do you base this on?
"
11,3,Travis,"Look, this is the world, right? But now, think of the world as... a living being.  If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it.
"
11,3,Older Louse,"Huh right, the world is conscious. It makes perfect sense.  Hello. Anybody? 
"
11,3,Travis,"If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen!
"
11,3,Older Louse,"Poodiggery and poppycock!
"
11,3,Travis,"I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation, perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation.
"
11,3,Older Louse,"Evacuation?! Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival. Do you know how much money we would lose? Escort Mr. Mayfield out. The President can't be bothered any further.
"
11,3,Travis,"Damn you Vice President Craig! You could be killin' us all!
"
11,3,Clyde,"This is so... embarrassing.
"
11,3,Girl,"I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for?
"
11,3,Clyde,"I have... I have AIDS. 
"
11,3,Nurse,"Clyde Harris? 
"
11,3,Doctor,"Yeeaahh, that's a pretty bad lice problem there. Good thing they pulled you out of school.
"
11,3,Clyde,"But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!
"
11,3,Doctor,"Well, believe it or not, some lice can actually attach themselves to flies, and then wait for the fly to land on someone's head where they can reproduce. And then the lice that live in your head now were probably all born there.
"
11,3,Clyde,"...Sick!
"
11,3,Doctor,"This shampoo should take care of it.  Use this in the shower. Your scalp may burn a bit afterwards, but... it should kill... every last one of them.
"
11,3,Kelly,"Travis? Everything okay?
"
11,3,Travis,"Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our babih. I want to name her... Hope.
"
11,3,Kelly,"Hope?
"
11,3,Travis,"Hope for a... chance at tomorrow? 
"
11,3,Louse 1,"It's raining? Now? 
"
11,3,Louse 2,"Woohoo! I love the rain! 
"
11,3,Travis,"Oh my God.  We have to get out of here!
"
11,3,Kelly,"What it, it's just rain.
"
11,3,Travis,"We have to get out of here now, Kellih! 
"
11,3,Louse 3,"What is that? 
"
11,3,Lice,"Whoa!  Ruuun! 
"
11,3,Travis,"Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly! 
"
11,3,Kelly,"My God, Travis, they're all dying!
"
11,3,Travis,"Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!
"
11,3,Louse 4,"What the hell is it?!
"
11,3,Louse 5,"Well it's okay, we're safe up here! 
"
11,3,Travis,"I don't think so! 
"
11,3,Louse 4,"OoOhOOOoooh!
"
11,3,Kelly,"Travis!
"
11,3,Travis,"Kellih! Hang on!
"
11,3,Kelly,"I can't... hang on!
"
11,3,Travis,"You have to! For the babih! 
"
11,3,Kelly,"Nooooooooooo!
"
11,3,Travis,"Kehhhllihhhh! No! Noooo! 
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?
"
11,3,Cartman,"Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"With what?
"
11,3,Craig,"With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice? 
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken.
"
11,3,Stan,"Somebody in this class?
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"Uh, yes.
"
11,3,Class,"Ohhhhh.
"
11,3,Cartman,"Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"That doesn't matter, it's over.
"
11,3,Cartman,"Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?
"
11,3,Red,"I wanna know who it was, too.
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!
"
11,3,Cartman,"That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
"
11,3,Class,"Yeah!
"
11,3,Bebe,"And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!
"
11,3,Craig,"How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!
"
11,3,Butters,"Yeah! Dumb girls!
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, they're dead now! We're moving on to Civil War history.  Ulysses S. Grant-
"
11,3,Travis,"Hope. Hope, you're alive.  My God...  Heh?!
"
11,3,Louse 6,"Help me... Help meeee... 
"
11,3,Louse 7,"Travis.  Over here! Travis, if you hadn't warned us to get up in them trees, we'd all be dead.
"
11,3,Travis,"How many survivors?
"
11,3,Louse 7,"Just the six of us. And the Vice President.
"
11,3,Travis,"You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!
"
11,3,Louse 8,"What do we do now?
"
11,3,Travis,"We aren't out of this yet! You two look for other survivors. You get whatever food you can and bring it back here. 
"
11,3,Vice President,"Who put you in charge?!
"
11,3,Travis,"God did! When he killed my wife! 
"
11,3,Cartman,"All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! 
"
11,3,Craig,"Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.
"
11,3,Cartman,"Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
"
11,3,Kyle,"You know what? I'll bet it was you!
"
11,3,Cartman,"Me?!
"
11,3,Kyle,"This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
"
11,3,Cartman,"I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!
"
11,3,Stan,"You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
"
11,3,Cartman,"That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. 
"
11,3,Kyle,"Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
"
11,3,Cartman,"And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! 
"
11,3,Butters,"Heh hey guys, what would I do?
"
11,3,Bebe,"Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.
"
11,3,Kyle,"It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
"
11,3,Clyde,"Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
"
11,3,Cartman,"There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 
"
11,3,Kyle,"It was him. It had to have been him!
"
11,3,Stan,"Yeah... Or you. 
"
11,3,Louse 9,"Mark? Mark, you have to hang on.
"
11,3,Travis,"This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet.
"
11,3,Louse 8,"How?
"
11,3,Travis,"First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even see another planet!
"
11,3,Louse 9,"The forbidden zone... We'll be exposed. We'll die out there.
"
11,3,Travis,"We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!
"
11,3,Louse 10,"Getting rid of us? You-you mean like it knows what it's doing?
"
11,3,Travis,"Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times!
"
11,3,Louse 9,"I'm not leaving my husband.
"
11,3,Louse 11,"Yeah huh-I'll take my chances here.
"
11,3,Travis,"You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my babih. 
"
11,3,Louse 12,"I'll go with you. There's nothing left for me here.
"
11,3,Vice President,"I wanna go too.
"
11,3,Travis,"Not a chance.
"
11,3,Vice President,"Look, I know I messed up, all right? But I think you're right. If we can get out of the forest, we might find another place to live.
"
11,3,Travis,"If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you.  Let's go.  Come on if you're comin' Mister Vice President! 
"
11,3,Vice President,"Yeah. Right behind you. 
"
11,3,Cartman,"All right, lock that door, Craig! 
"
11,3,Kyle,"What's this about, Cartman? 
"
11,3,Cartman,"I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
"
11,3,Jimmy,"Ur ur re- ur really?
"
11,3,Kyle,"That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
"
11,3,Cartman,"This is a scientific test, designed to-
"
11,3,Kyle,"You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
"
11,3,Cartman,"I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
"
11,3,Kyle,"Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
"
11,3,Cartman,"If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!
"
11,3,Craig,"Yeah. That's true.
"
11,3,Jimmy,"I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide
"
11,3,Token,"Yeah. Me neither.
"
11,3,Kyle,"All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
"
11,3,Cartman,"Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
"
11,3,Cartman,"All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. 
"
11,3,Butters,"Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
"
11,3,Kyle,"It doesn't prove anything!
"
11,3,Cartman,"Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. 
"
11,3,Clyde,"Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.
"
11,3,Cartman,"It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! 
"
11,3,Token,"What the hell?! 
"
11,3,Cartman,"Kenny!
"
11,3,Kyle,"No way.
"
11,3,Craig,"You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.
"
11,3,Cartman,"Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! 
"
11,3,Louse 12,"We've done it. We've reached the forbidden zone.  I've always heard stories about this place. Never thought it was real.
"
11,3,Travis,"It's real. Real as my love for my unborn babih.
"
11,3,Vice President,"So what exactly is your plan, Travis?
"
11,3,Travis,"Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.
"
11,3,Louse 12,"Travis. Travis, you're, so wise, so strong. If we make it out of this, I'd like to... be with you.
"
11,3,Travis,"Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name  Kelly.
"
11,3,Louse 12,"She was a lucky woman to have you.
"
11,3,Travis,"Luck had nothin' to do with it. 
"
11,3,Vice President,"Sorry to cut the honeymoon short!
"
11,3,Travis,"Why you murdering bastard!
"
11,3,Vice President,"Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk!
"
11,3,Travis,"What the hell do you want, Vice President?!
"
11,3,Vice President,"Walk! 
"
11,3,Craig,"Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! 
"
11,3,Clyde,"What? What are you gonna do to him?
"
11,3,Cartman,"He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! 
"
11,3,Clyde,"You guys, wait. 
"
11,3,Cartman,"What, Clyde?
"
11,3,Clyde,"I... nothing.
"
11,3,Cartman,"All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!
"
11,3,"Token, Craig","Yeah!
"
11,3,Jimmy,"Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up! 
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"Yello?
"
11,3,Clyde,"Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!
"
11,3,Clyde,"Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!
"
11,3,Vice President,"That's good! That's far enough! 
"
11,3,Travis,"What are you going to do?
"
11,3,Vice President,"I'm gonna go back to the village, start to rebuild, mate with the females, become... President!
"
11,3,Travis,"Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead!
"
11,3,Vice President,"It was a disaster! Disasters happen!
"
11,3,Travis,"Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my babih!
"
11,3,Vice President,"Actually, you're never leaving here either, Travis! 
"
11,3,Travis,"Damn you! Why?!
"
11,3,Vice President,"Because when I'm President, I can't have pests like you constantly trying to preach that the world is alive! You're an idealistic fool! The world is not ""conscious,"" we are conscious! If the world was alive, it would feel this! 
"
11,3,Clyde,"Ow. 
"
11,3,Vice President,"You die he- 
"
11,3,Cartman,"Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
"
11,3,Kenny,"(Not guilty!)
"
11,3,Cartman,"Guilty! I thought so! 
"
11,3,Craig,"All right, let's do this!
"
11,3,Clyde,"You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?
"
11,3,Cartman,"All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! 
"
11,3,Kenny,"Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!
"
11,3,Clyde,"Wait, wait!
"
11,3,Kyle,"Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
"
11,3,Craig,"He had cooties and he lied about it!
"
11,3,Kyle,"Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.
"
11,3,Clyde,"What?
"
11,3,Kyle,"I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
"
11,3,Stan,"Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!
"
11,3,Clyde,"Wait a-wait a minute, what?
"
11,3,Cartman,"Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!
"
11,3,Stan,"You had head lice?
"
11,3,Cartman,"Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
"
11,3,Mrs. Garrison,"You all had head lice!  Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses!
"
11,3,Craig,"I thought I was the only one.
"
11,3,Butters,"Me too.
"
11,3,Cartman,"But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 
"
11,3,Kenny,"Dudes!
"
11,3,Travis,"Kellih. Kellih, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our babih. But I let you down, babe.  Keh... k-Kellih? 
"
11,3,Louse 13,"You are welcome here.  You're safe now. We've lived here for generation after generation, never being disturbed.
"
11,3,Travis,"Heh. We made it, Hope. We made it, Kellih! 
"
11,3,Agent,"Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Angelina Jolie! 
"
11,3,Angelina Jolie,"Hello everyone!  Hello!
"
11,4,Mrs. Garrison,"All right, students, let's take our seats. Everyone try to be nice because we have a new student joining us today, and I know you'll all make him feel welcome. Say hello to... Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Uh oh! 
"
11,4,Mrs. Garrison,"Welcome to our class, Baahir.
"
11,4,Baahir,"Thank you.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Duhude, dude,  not cool!
"
11,4,Mrs. Garrison,"Why don't you take a seat in Kyle's empty desk for now?
"
11,4,Baahir,"Okay. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
"
11,4,Mrs. Garrison,"Eric, what the hell is wrong with you?!
"
11,4,Cartman,"What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?
"
11,4,Mrs. Garrison,"Eric, that's enough! Not all Muslim people are terrorists!
"
11,4,Cartman,"No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
"
11,4,Butters,"Now you go, Baahir. 
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yeah?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Kyle, are you on your computer?
"
11,4,Kyle,"What? No, I'm sick. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Get online. I need you to check something for me.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Dude, leave me alone.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
"
11,4,Kyle,"What? Why?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Get online now!
"
11,4,Kyle,"All right, all right. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
"
11,4,Kyle,"Over a hundred.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
"
11,4,Kyle,"White Stripes
"
11,4,Cartman,"That's funny.
"
11,4,Kyle,"What?
"
11,4,Cartman,"He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
"
11,4,Cartman,"The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
"
11,4,Barbrady,"Hello?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 
"
11,4,Barbrady,"From what? Who is this?
"
11,4,Cartman,"I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
"
11,4,Barbrady,"Are you serious?
"
11,4,Cartman,"If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
"
11,4,Barbrady,"Like what?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
"
11,4,Barbrady,"Oh jeez.
"
11,4,Mrs. Garrison,"What the hell?
"
11,4,Principal Victoria,"All students are to evacuate the school immediately! 
"
11,4,Butters,"Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
"
11,4,Baahir,"Sure, okay. 
"
11,4,Butters,"Well all right! 
"
11,4,Kyle,"Dude. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
11,4,Kyle,"Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
"
11,4,Kyle,"I guess so.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
"
11,4,Kyle,"Wuh what doesn't follow?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
"
11,4,Kyle,"Okay.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yeah. Actually, there is.
"
11,4,Cartman,"What?
"
11,4,Kyle,"There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 
"
11,4,Agent,"Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today.
"
11,4,Head Agent,"What?  This is CIA head, Alan Thompson.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"What do you know?
"
11,4,Cartman,"He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me!
"
11,4,Cartman,"I said I will only talk to the President!
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"Look, if you have information of a threat, you could-
"
11,4,Cartman,"LALALALALALALALA!
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"I will have you arrested for-!
"
11,4,Cartman,"LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
"
11,4,Aide,"Call is coming through now, Mr. President.
"
11,4,Bush,"Hello?
"
11,4,Cartman,"President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
"
11,4,Bush,"Huh? Who.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
"
11,4,Bush,"Hildog?
"
11,4,Aide,"Yes, I understand. I'll let Ms. Clinton know.
"
11,4,Hillary,"What is it, Brian?
"
11,4,Brian,"Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today.
"
11,4,Hillary,"Is the thread credible?
"
11,4,Brian,"We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off. 
"
11,4,Hillary,"No. No, I will not be bullied by terrorist threats. Your men do a good job, Brian. I have faith that any thread will be taken care of accordingly.
"
11,4,Driver,"We've reached the rally site, Hildog.
"
11,4,Aide 2,"Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton, I'm sure everything will be fine.
"
11,4,Hillary,"Thank you, Chris. 
"
11,4,Chris,"They know about the bomb!
"
11,4,Blond Russian,"That is impossible! We took every measure to assure the bomb was hidden from sight.
"
11,4,Chris,"Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened.
"
11,4,Blond Russian,"That bomb must travel with the Clinton rally to Boston!
"
11,4,Chris,"The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!
"
11,4,Blonde Russian,"Then we have no choice. We have to move up the attack.
"
11,4,Chris,"I understand, comrade.
"
11,4,Blonde Russian,"Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
"
11,4,Kyle,"So then maybe you're wrong.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yeah.  What is that?
"
11,4,Cartman,"It's my balls! 
"
11,4,Kyle,"God damn it Cartman!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.
"
11,4,Mayor McDaniels,"People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton! 
"
11,4,Hillary,"It is so nice to be back in a small town like the one I came from. 
"
11,4,Hildog Fan,"Here we go! 
"
11,4,Brian,"Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat? 
"
11,4,Otis,"We have the bomb-sniffing pig going through the crowd. If there is a bomb, the pig will find it. 
"
11,4,Hillary,"This is why I campaign in small towns like these! Because it is in towns like South Park that you find the true America! 
"
11,4,Aide 3,"Oh my God, she got a scent! 
"
11,4,Brian,"What?!
"
11,4,Aide 3,"The pig is picking up the smell of nuclear residue. Terrorists have hidden a bomb!
"
11,4,Brian,"Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?!
"
11,4,Aide 3,"Come on, find it. Find! 
"
11,4,Brian,"My God, they hid it under the stage?!
"
11,4,Female Aide,"No wait, look. 
"
11,4,Hillary,"How much money do we have to waste on needless spendin' when we should be focusing all our attention on... uh...  on the education of all- Woo haha, whoa there, girl. Haha,  uh, uh, on the education of all children.  Oh, I declare!
"
11,4,Otis,"Oh my God. Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...
"
11,4,Agent,"Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... well, in her...
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"In her what?
"
11,4,Agent,"In her snatch, sir.
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"What?!
"
11,4,Hillary,"What is goin' on? I wasn't finished.
"
11,4,Brian,"Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing.  Yes.
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson with the CIA. We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch.
"
11,4,Brian,"A what?!
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"A snatch. It's the technical term for vagina.
"
11,4,Brian,"No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!
"
11,4,Mr. Waters,"Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters. It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke.
"
11,4,Hillary,"What is goin' on, Brian?
"
11,4,Brian,"Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz.
"
11,4,Hillary,"Oh my.
"
11,4,Brian,"What do we do? Can we disable the timer?
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"It won't have a timer. Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him.
"
11,4,Brian,"But then that means...
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"Yes. If we don't find that detonator, everyone in the town of South Park is going to die. For-ever.
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"Do we have that phone trace?
"
11,4,CIA Vice Head,"The call is going through now, sir.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yeah? 
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"This is CIA head Alan Thompson. We spoke before about the- 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yes, Mr. Thompson?
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"Well, we've just arrived in your town.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Why? Did you find something?
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz.
"
11,4,Cartman,"A snuke?
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"That's right. It's controlled by a remote detonator. We have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off.
"
11,4,Cartman,"I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"We're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"Oh, hey.
"
11,4,Stan,"Dude, we totally got let out of school.
"
11,4,Kyle,"I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for ""Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally"" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
"
11,4,Stan,"Russian?
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
"
11,4,Stan,"So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
"
11,4,Kyle,"No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
"
11,4,Stan,"Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Oh that's a good idea. 
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"What is going on? What have we done?
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"They claim they don't know anything about an attack.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Big surprise!
"
11,4,Police Officer,"Sir, first pass of the house, we didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere.
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"Mr. Hakeem, where is your son?
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"We thought he was at school. He's not at school?
"
11,4,Brian,"You're doing great, Ms. Clinton.
"
11,4,Hillary,"Do they know how long, Brian? How long before the snuke in my snizz goes off?
"
11,4,Brian,"They'll find the detonator, Hildog.
"
11,4,Aide 3,"We can't wait for them to find the detonator. If we can get to the bomb, me-maybe we can deactivate it. Can't somebody go and take a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz?
"
11,4,EOD Leader,"I'm not sending any of my men in there.
"
11,4,Chris,"Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?
"
11,4,Vladimir,"Everything is set. We have the detonator up and running. 
"
11,4,Agent 2,"Mr. Hakeem, we need to know where your son is!
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"I tell you, I do not know.
"
11,4,Agent 2,"This is getting us nowhere. If he knows anything, he's not saying.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Let me have time with him.
"
11,4,Female Agent,"What are you going to do?
"
11,4,Cartman,"We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"He should be at school!  Hey!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Where is the detonator?!
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"Wuh-what detonator are you ta-
"
11,4,Cartman,"I can do this aaall day.
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"I don't know anything about a-  Aawwwwgh  Stop it! Really!
"
11,4,Cartman,"You can make it stop!
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"I don't have the- 
"
11,4,Female Agent,"Are we just gonna let this go on? 
"
11,4,Kyle,"Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
"
11,4,Stan,"You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. 
"
11,4,CIA Vice Head,"Ferris, set up over there. Two of you can take that bed area. 
"
11,4,Kyle,"Hey.
"
11,4,CIA Vice Head,"Donner, take over that station. 
"
11,4,Kyle,"What's going on?
"
11,4,CIA Vice Head,"This apartment is being absorbed by Homeland Security!
"
11,4,Kyle,"...Homeland Security?
"
11,4,CIA Vice Head,"Look, your little game of goin' over people's heads is over! You could still work, but from now on you answer to me, you got that?!
"
11,4,FBI Leader,"'Scuse me, who's in charge here?!
"
11,4,CIA Vice Head,"I am!
"
11,4,FBI Leader,"Yeah well not anymore you're not. This apartment has just been assigned to the FBI.
"
11,4,CIA Vice Head,"That's outrageous! On whose orders?!
"
11,4,FBI Leader,"On order of the Secretary of Defense! You had your shot, now I'm in charge!
"
11,4,ATF Leader,"Not anymore you're not! Orders just came down from Central! They want ATF handling this on all fronts! All right people, from now on you're answering to me!
"
11,4,Secret Service Leader,"Not anymore they're not! Orders from the President: he wants this handled by his staff personally! Now Nelson is in charge.
"
11,4,Nelson,"Not anymore I'm not! 
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"What are you going to do to my wife?!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
"
11,4,Mrs. Hakeem,"We told you: we don't know.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. 
"
11,4,Female Agent,"Did he just inject himself with apple juice?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Where is your son?!
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"She doesn't know either. 
"
11,4,Mrs. Hakeem,"Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"I mean it! Stop! That is disgusting! Where is your mother?! 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Answer it! 
"
11,4,Mrs. Hakeem,"Hallo? Hallo Baahir. Where are you? Who it But-ters?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Butters.
"
11,4,Mrs. Hakeem,"Baahir, one of your classmates is keeping us hostage.  Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! 
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"Ogh! You filthy little rapscallion!
"
11,4,Cartman,"We got him! I know where he is!
"
11,4,Female Agent,"All right, where? We'll send our people in.
"
11,4,Cartman,"No no, he's my lead. 
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"You're not going alone.
"
11,4,Cartman,"You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 
"
11,4,CIA Leader 2,"All right, people, I'm in charge now and we will find the terrorists. Jarvis, I want you to check for any terrorist chatter on AOL. Marley and Greggs, try searching for nuclear devices on askjeeves.com.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
"
11,4,CIA Leader 2,"Are you tellin' me how to do my job?
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
"
11,4,CIA Leader 2,"Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube and cross-reference it with JDate!
"
11,4,Chase,"Checking.
"
11,4,Stan,"Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!
"
11,4,Female Agent 2,"Sir, these kids are right. We've just received intel that Russian terrorists are believed to be responsible for the threat.
"
11,4,CIA Leader 2,"Where's the intel from?
"
11,4,Female Agent 2,"We just read it on Drudge Report.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
"
11,4,CIA Leader 2,"We do this my way! I'm the one in charge!
"
11,4,Kyle,"...Not anymore you're not.
"
11,4,CIA Leader 2,"Oh, snap. 
"
11,4,Butters,"Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Uuugh! 
"
11,4,Butters,"Oh hey Eric.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Where is the detonator!
"
11,4,Baahir,"The what?
"
11,4,Cartman,"You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
"
11,4,Baahir,"Leave me alone!  Upta!
"
11,4,Butters,"Hey, I was about to win!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! 
"
11,4,Terrorist #1,"Get in the van! 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
"
11,4,Terrorist #1,"Get in the van!
"
11,4,Aide 3,"That's it! We don't have a choice anymore! Somebody is going to have to go in, and try to disarm the snuke manually!
"
11,4,EOD Leader,"No, it's too dangerous! That snatch has not seen action in over 30 years! It could be toxic!
"
11,4,Brian,"I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
"
11,4,Vladimir,"You called and warned the government of our plans! What you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! We were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of America could attack!
"
11,4,Cartman,"That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
"
11,4,Vladimir,"Do you really think Muslims are behind this terrorist threat?!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Uhh yes, of course?
"
11,4,Vladimir,"America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?
"
11,4,Cartman,"The Russians?
"
11,4,Vladimir,"Before that.
"
11,4,Cartman,"The Germans?
"
11,4,Vladimir,"Before that.
"
11,4,Cartman,"The Germans again?
"
11,4,Vladimir,"Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!
"
11,4,Cartman,"You can't possible mean...?
"
11,4,Captain,"Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown!  Yes, Your Majesty?
"
11,4,Queen Elizabeth II,"The Russians are ready to set off the diversion. Full sail.
"
11,4,Captain,"Full sail, Your Majesty?
"
11,4,Aide 3,"All right, Brian, this is it. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch.
"
11,4,Brian,"All right. I'm nearing her snizz now.
"
11,4,EOD Leader,"God help him.
"
11,4,Aide 3,"What do you see, Brian?
"
11,4,Brian,"It's dark... cold...
"
11,4,Aide 3,"You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as you can... Y-you have to look inside the snizz.
"
11,4,Brian,"Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device! 
"
11,4,Aide 3,"You're doin' great, Brian. Hang in there.
"
11,4,Brian,"There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something... 
"
11,4,Aide 3,"Say again, Brian.
"
11,4,Brian,"There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me!
"
11,4,EOD Leader,"Brian, get out of there!
"
11,4,Brian,"Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!
"
11,4,EOD Leader,"Brian? Brian, what's happening?
"
11,4,Brian,"It's... eating my head! It's eating my head! 
"
11,4,Hillary,"Hoh my!
"
11,4,Kyle,"I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
"
11,4,Female Agent 2,"The British?
"
11,4,Agent 4,"Loyalist Red Coats!
"
11,4,Chase,"Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account! It does list an address in South Park!
"
11,4,Kyle,"All right! MapQuest the address!
"
11,4,Chase,"I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Good thinking
"
11,4,CIA Leader 2,"Sir, we have the terrorists' location. IM'ing you now.
"
11,4,Vladimir,"It was good knowing you, comrade.
"
11,4,Baahir,"Please. Think about what you are doing. The British are just using you; you're going to die.
"
11,4,Vladimir,"Yes, but we will be rich.
"
11,4,Agent,"Left flank, prig prang and clear! Go go go! 
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"The game is over! Get down on the ground!
"
11,4,Vladimir,"How did they find us?
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"We know about everything! Your diversion to help the Red Coats is over!
"
11,4,Vladimir,"It doesn't matter. The detonator is on a timer. You are too late! In three minutes!  What the hell?!
"
11,4,Agent,"The power went out!
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"Well so then what time is it? 
"
11,4,Vladimir,"Oh crap.
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"Take 'em down! 
"
11,4,Vladimir,"No! I don't want to die without being paid! 
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"The detonator is secured, general. You are cleared to proceed.
"
11,4,Captain,"The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!
"
11,4,Soldier,"How?
"
11,4,Captain,"Fire at will! 
"
11,4,Queen Elizabeth II,"Yes?
"
11,4,Captain,"Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution.
"
11,4,Queen Elizabeth II,"I see. 
"
11,4,Mr. Thompson,"Well, looks like we saved our country from British rule once again.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
"
11,4,Baahir,"Really?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
"
11,4,Kyle,"...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
"
11,4,Cartman,"But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
"
11,4,Kyle,"...Maybe. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
"
11,4,Kyle,"...That is so missing the point.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
"
11,4,Kyle,"The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yes or no, Kyle?!
"
11,4,Kyle,"No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
"
11,4,Cartman,"But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? 
"
11,4,Mr. Hakeem,"Baahir! Get away from that disgusting child! Get back home and start packing your things! We are leaving this whole intolerant country! 
"
11,4,Butters,"Awwwww.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
"
11,5,Randy,"...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
"
11,5,Randy,"Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. 
"
11,5,Stan,"Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
"
11,5,Randy,"Wha... what do you mean, ""Why do we do this?"" It's Easter!
"
11,5,Stan,"Right, so, why do we color eggs? 
"
11,5,Randy,"Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.
"
11,5,Stan,"Yeah, but why?
"
11,5,Randy,"Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.
"
11,5,Stan,"So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
"
11,5,Randy,"That's right.
"
11,5,Stan,"You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
"
11,5,Randy,"Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!
"
11,5,Stan,"I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
"
11,5,Randy,"What is wrong with him?!
"
11,5,Sharon,"Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. 
"
11,5,Randy,"You know so little! 
"
11,5,Cartman,"And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
"
11,5,Mall Bunny,"Ahh, don't you think that's-
"
11,5,Cartman,"Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
"
11,5,Aide,"Smile! 
"
11,5,Cartman,"Bye, Easter bunny! 
"
11,5,Mall Bunny,"Oh my God. 
"
11,5,Stan,"All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
"
11,5,Mall Bunny,"Huh?
"
11,5,Stan,"What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!
"
11,5,Mall Bunny,"Look, kid ahh, I'm j-, I'm just a guy in a costume.
"
11,5,Stan,"I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
"
11,5,Mall Bunny,"Huhuh, Easter's just Easter. Just, just go with it, kid.
"
11,5,Stan,"No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! 
"
11,5,Mall Bunny,"I need a break. Can I have a break?  We have a problem. Somebody's onto us. Yeah, he's askin' a lot of questions. Only a matter of time before he finds out what Easter's really about. Yes, I understand what must be done. Call the others. 
"
11,5,Stan,"Mom? Dad?  Anybody home?
"
11,5,Randy,"Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! 
"
11,5,Stan,"Dad! You've gotta help me! 
"
11,5,Randy,"Hang on, I'm taking a crap.
"
11,5,Stan,"Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!
"
11,5,Randy,"What?
"
11,5,Stan,"They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?
"
11,5,Randy,"We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.
"
11,5,Gray Hare,"Randy?
"
11,5,Randy,"Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
"
11,5,Purple Hare,"Ohhh.
"
11,5,Randy,"Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
"
11,5,Randy,"I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!
"
11,5,Stan,"Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
"
11,5,Randy,"We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.
"
11,5,Stan,"Does Mom know about this?
"
11,5,Randy,"Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.
"
11,5,Stan,"I don't understand!
"
11,5,Randy,"I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
"
11,5,Stan,"Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
"
11,5,Randy,"Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!
"
11,5,Stan,"So what is the secret of Easter?
"
11,5,Randy,"I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.
"
11,5,Randy,"I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.
"
11,5,Stan,"Grandpa's in it too?
"
11,5,Randy,"Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
"
11,5,Stan,"Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
"
11,5,Randy,"You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.
"
11,5,Stan,"You mean the old Galveston Lodge? 
"
11,5,Randy,"Dammit.
"
11,5,Hare 1,"Hey Bill.
"
11,5,Hare 2,"Evenin' Marcus.
"
11,5,Hare 3,"Heh heh hey, look at you!
"
11,5,Hare 4,"Hey everybody.
"
11,5,Hare 5,"Stan Marsh, welcome! You must be very excited.
"
11,5,Stan,"Must I?
"
11,5,Marvin,"There he is! There's my grandson!
"
11,5,Stan,"Hi Grandpa.
"
11,5,Marvin,"I'm proud of ya, Billy.
"
11,5,Stan,"...Stan.
"
11,5,Pink Hare,"Tonight, we determine if a new member is worthy of protecting the Secret. Bring out... the rabbit.
"
11,5,Hares,"Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.
In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.
"
11,5,Pink Hare,"All hail the cute rabbit, Snowball!
"
11,5,Hares,"Hail Snowball. 
"
11,5,Pink Hare,"Stan Marsh, are you ready to hear the secret of Easter?
"
11,5,Stan,"Yeah.
"
11,5,Randy,"Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.
"
11,5,Stan,"Yeah, I wanna know already.
"
11,5,Pink Hare,"Very well. At the Last Supper, Jesus Christ met with his 12 Disciples. It was there that- 
"
11,5,Gray Hare,"They found us! 
"
11,5,White Hare,"Protect Snowball! 
"
11,5,Brown Hare,"They're everywhere! 
"
11,5,Randy,"Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!
"
11,5,Stan,"Where am I supposed to go?
"
11,5,Randy,"Just get out of here! 
"
11,5,Layman,"Where is the rabbit?!
"
11,5,Hare 6,"Where are you taking us?
"
11,5,Hare 7,"No! I'm not goin' anywhere! 
"
11,5,Stan,"Jesus Christ! 
"
11,5,Layman,"Who did you give the rabbit to?!  Search the area! The boy could not have gotten far!
"
11,5,Stan,"Oh no... 
"
11,5,Stan,"Help.
"
11,5,Kyle,"What happened?
"
11,5,Stan,"My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
"
11,5,Kyle,"...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
"
11,5,Stan,"Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
"
11,5,Kyle,"Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.
"
11,5,Randy,"Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something.
"
11,5,Nelson,"My legs. I... I think they're broken.
"
11,5,Randy,"Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?
"
11,5,Nelson,"Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... 
"
11,5,Randy,"You...
"
11,5,Kyle,"Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 
"
11,5,Butler,"What is it in regard to? 
"
11,5,Kyle,"The history of Easter.
"
11,5,Teabag,"Sorry boys, it's a little late for me to be giving lectures. 
"
11,5,Stan,"Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? 
"
11,5,Teabag,"The Keepers?  The Guardians of the Secret?
"
11,5,Stan,"My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
"
11,5,Teabag,"Come on in. 
"
11,5,Teabag,"The Hare Club For Men has been around for centuries. One of its most famous members was Leonardo da Vinci.  Behold the Last Supper. The dinner Christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified. What food do you see on the table?
"
11,5,Stan,"Just bread...
"
11,5,Teabag,"Really? Look to Jesus's right.  The food which is a little different color than the others.
"
11,5,Kyle,"It kind of looks like... an egg.
"
11,5,Teabag,"Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of...  Saint Peter.
"
11,5,Kyle,"Who is Saint Peter?
"
11,5,Stan,"He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
"
11,5,Teabag,"Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit. 
"
11,5,Kyle,"Peter Rabbit.
"
11,5,Teabag,"Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely.
"
11,5,Kyle,"I don't see it.
"
11,5,Teabag,"Look closelier. 
"
11,5,Stan,"He looks like a guy.
"
11,5,Teabag,"Look more closelier.  With laser technology we can look beneath the paint, the way da Vinci originally painted it.  That... is Saint Peter.  The original Pope of Christianity.
"
11,5,Kyle,"I don't believe it.
"
11,5,Teabag,"Proof is everywhere. Look at the Pope's hat.  It makes no sense, except that it was originally designed...  for a rabbit.
"
11,5,Stan,"But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
"
11,5,Teabag,"Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive.
"
11,5,Kyle,"So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit?
"
11,5,Randy,"You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell!
"
11,5,Randy,"It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
"
11,5,Layman,"I'm sorry I couldn't bring you the rabbit, Your Holiness, but they know where it is!
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?!
"
11,5,Randy,"I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.
"
11,5,Layman,"Take him to be tortured!
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"Tortured, huh, but Bill, all this... torturing and ninjas, it just doesn't seem very Christian.
"
11,5,Bill,"You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him! 
"
11,5,Randy,"No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!
"
11,5,Stan,"I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
"
11,5,Teabag,"I believe Snowball must be a direct descendant of St. Peter himself, and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne. 
"
11,5,Butler,"Mr. Teabag! Get out! 
"
11,5,Stan,"They found me!
"
11,5,Teabag,"Boys, get out of here!  Head to the woods! I'll try to buy you some time. 
"
11,5,Bill,"Check upstairs!  Upstairs clear! Try the office! 
"
11,5,Ninja 1,"In here! 
"
11,5,Ninja 2,"What's that? 
"
11,5,Ninja 1,"PEEEEPS! 
"
11,5,Kyle,"So what now?
"
11,5,Stan,"If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
"
11,5,Kyle,"You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
"
11,5,Stan,"What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 
"
11,5,Kyle,"I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
"
11,5,Announcer,"Live, from the Vatican, it's our Easter Vigil coverage.
"
11,5,Reporter,"As Holy Saturday comes to an end, the Easter vigil at the Vatican begins. Thousand have turned out to hear the Pope and celebrate the Resurrection.  For this Easter vigil the Pope is also showing his divine grace by feeding the poor, with a massive rabbit stew. 
"
11,5,Violet Hare,"NOOO! Noo! No, don't put m-  AAAAAAAAAAH!
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"Bill, this seems extreme.
"
11,5,Bill,"The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.
"
11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Your Holiness, a child has arrived with a the rabbit!
"
11,5,Bill,"Ya see? 
"
11,5,Randy,"Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"Yes, hand it over!
"
11,5,Stan,"First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"We promise.
"
11,5,Bill,"We swear it, on the cross.
"
11,5,Randy,"Just hand over the bunny, Stan!
"
11,5,Stan,"Okay, fine. 
"
11,5,Randy,"Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.
"
11,5,Stan,"You said ""hand over the bunny.""
"
11,5,Randy,"No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
"
11,5,Bill,"Take them into custody! 
"
11,5,Stan,"Hey, what the hell!
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"Bill, we have zeh rabbit, it's all we need.
"
11,5,Bill,"Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These ""whores"" must be punished in front of everyone!
"
11,5,Kyle,"You swore on the cross, fatso!
"
11,5,Bill,"Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross! 
"
11,5,Randy,"Oh, we should've seen that coming!
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"Bill, I'm not sure that double-crossing people is very Christian.
"
11,5,Bill,"It is what Christ would've wanted!
"
11,5,Jesus,"Who are you to say that?! 
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"It... can't be.
"
11,5,"Stan, Kyle","Jesus! 
"
11,5,Singer,"He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!
"
11,5,Cardinal,"Jesus, we thought you died. In Iraq.
"
11,5,Jesus,"I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.
"
11,5,Stan,"Jesus, you did answer my prayer! 
"
11,5,Jesus,"Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan.
"
11,5,Purple Hare 2,"Ohh, that's me Neato!
"
11,5,Jesus,"This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope.
"
11,5,Bill,"Kill him!
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"What?!
"
11,5,Bill,"He goes against the Church. He must die!
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"All right, that does it, Bill. I'm pretty sure that killing Jesus is not very Christian.
"
11,5,Bill,"You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them! 
"
11,5,Jesus,"What are you doing?! 
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"I am the Pope!
"
11,5,Bill,"You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord!  The Easter vigil will go on as planned!  Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies!
"
11,5,Jesus,"What is your problem, guy?!
"
11,5,Bill,"Lock up those two Jews!  We'll deal with them later.
"
11,5,Stan,"No! No! 
"
11,5,Reporter,"A strange turn of events here at the Vatican: Pope Benedictus has stepped down, ushering the new era of... Pope Bill Donohue
"
11,5,Bill,"My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier! 
"
11,5,Randy,"No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!  Oof.
"
11,5,Pope Benedict,"Forgive me, Jesus.
"
11,5,Jesus,"We'll never get out in time to stop him!
"
11,5,Kyle,"Don't you have any superpowers?
"
11,5,Jesus,"Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me.
"
11,5,Kyle,"What?
"
11,5,Jesus,"Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.
"
11,5,Kyle,"N-no way! Do it yourself.
"
11,5,Jesus,"Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!
"
11,5,Kyle,"Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
"
11,5,Jesus,"Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.
"
11,5,Kyle,"Don't make me do this.
"
11,5,Jesus,"My son, there is no time! Do it!
"
11,5,Kyle,"Eric Cartman can never know about this.
"
11,5,Jesus,"I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter.
"
11,5,Kyle,"Happy Easter, Jesus. 
"
11,5,Jesus,"Awgh! 
"
11,5,Kyle,"...Jesus?
"
11,5,Bill,"Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit! 
"
11,5,Cardinal,"Sorry, little bunny.
"
11,5,Stan,"Snowball! 
"
11,5,Tourist,"Jesus?
"
11,5,Jesus,"Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent!
"
11,5,Bill,"Why won't you go away?!
"
11,5,Jesus,"One man cannot be the voice of the Church!
"
11,5,Bill,"Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!
"
11,5,Jesus,"Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position. 
"
11,5,Crowd,"YAAAY!
"
11,5,Stan,"All right Jesus!
"
11,5,Crowd,"Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.
"
11,5,Cardinal,"Your Holiness, what should we tell the world about how to run their lives?  It isn't saying anything.
"
11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it.
"
11,5,Randy,"Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.
"
11,5,Stan,"Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
"
11,5,Randy,"That's my boy.
"
11,5,Crowd,"In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"Everyone, sit down and shut the fuck up! God damn it!  Stupid ass man! They're all the same! 
"
11,6,Kyle,"Oh God, here we go again.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"All men care about is sex! I spent two hours getting ready for that stupid date! And when the bastard checks out my body, he just says, ""Hey, did you used to be a guy or somethin'?"" I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!
"
11,6,Stan,"Uh oh, this isn't good.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"Did I say something to you, sugartits?!
"
11,6,Stan,"No ma'am.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"You boys make me sick! You're well on your way to being men, who only think with their penises! I am assigning all of you weekend homework! You are going to read Hemmingway's book, ""The Old Man and the Sea""!
"
11,6,Cartman,"Have you lost your mind?
"
11,6,Stan,"Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done!
"
11,6,Butters,"But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?!
"
11,6,Stan,"Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
"
11,6,Kyle,"Our whole weekend is shot.
"
11,6,Kenny,"(What the hell are we going to do?!)
"
11,6,Cartman,"You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
"
11,6,Stan,"We don't?
"
11,6,Cartman,"No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
"
11,6,Cartman,"¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"Yeis.
"
11,6,Laborer 2,"We looking work, sí.
"
11,6,Cartman,"Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" for us. Comprende? ""The Old Mand Y La Mer"".
"
11,6,Laborer 2,"Okay.
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"Sure.
"
11,6,Laborer 3,"Okay.
"
11,6,Laborer 4,"Yeah.

11,6,Cartman,"Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.

11,6,Laborer 2,"Okay no problem. That's no problem.

"
11,6,Laborer 5,"Sí, la samuraisia.
"
11,6,Cartman,"Okay, gracias.
"
11,6,Stan and Kyle,"Gracias.
"
11,6,Stan,"Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
"
11,6,Cartman,"Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"They can all rot in hell! Who needs men anyway?! They're God damned arrogant self-centered assholes is what they are! 
"
11,6,Woman,"Are you okay, hon?
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"I just hate men is all. It's like all they care about is how hot you look!
"
11,6,Woman,"Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"Tell me about it! I can't even stretch at a normal gym without some guy trying to stare down my vage.
"
11,6,Woman,"I'm Allyson.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"Oh, I'm Janet. Janet Garrison. Sorry I'm so pissed off.
"
11,6,Allyson,"No, I like it. You seem like a very strong woman.
"
11,6,Janet,"Yeah, I've been told that.
"
11,6,Allyson,"How come I've never seen you down at the girl bar?
"
11,6,Janet,"Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.
"
11,6,Allyson,"Oh you'd love it. It's the only bar in town where women like us can hang out and be ourselves. It's called ""Lebow"".
"
11,6,Allyson,"Hi Linda, hi Kate.
"
11,6,Woman 2,"Hey Allyson.
"
11,6,Woman 3,"Who's the new girl?
"
11,6,Woman 2,"Allyson always goes for the butch ones.
"
11,6,Allyson,"Hey Nell. What's up, Tracy?
"
11,6,Janet,"Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.
"
11,6,Allyson,"Yeah. Well, most of the girls here have done each other. 
"
11,6,Janet,"He-yeah. Done what?
"
11,6,Allyson,"You know.  Had sex. 
"
11,6,Janet,"Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?
"
11,6,Allyson,"Yeah. I... thought you understood that.
"
11,6,Janet,"Oh jeez. 
"
11,6,Allyson,"I'm sorry. I thought you knew what ""girl bar"" meant.
"
11,6,Janet,"But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa. 
"
11,6,Allyson,"Janet, I'm really sorry. It's just that at the gym you said you didn't like being with men, so I thought you were a-
"
11,6,Janet,"I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!
"
11,6,Allyson,"Have you... never even... thought... of being... with another woman?
"
11,6,Janet,"Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda  scissor or something.
"
11,6,Allyson,"There are a lot of ways to make love, Janet.
"
11,6,Janet,"I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.
"
11,6,Allyson,"Could I... maybe kiss you? 
"
11,6,Janet,"Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!
"
11,6,Allyson,"Is it wrong, Janet? Let your inhibitions go. Let's just have fun tonight.  No commitments.  Just fun. 
"
11,6,Janet,"Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson!
"
11,6,Allyson,"Janet, you're crazy!
"
11,6,Janet,"Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!
"
11,6,Kyle,"They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
"
11,6,Cartman,"They'll be done.  ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?
"
11,6,Laborers,"Sí, sí.
"
11,6,Kyle,"What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"Eet starts there the old man, and his job is to catch the feesh, so he get in the boht, to try and catch feesh.
"
11,6,Laborer 2,"Saw he catch the feesh, but the feesh is very strong, so the old man, cannot reel in the feesh.
"
11,6,Laborer 5,"So then he fight the feesh. Some more. And he finally catch the feesh.
"
11,6,Kyle,"He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"No, because on the way home, the sharks come and eat the feesh. And so, he no make money. 
"
11,6,Stan,"That's it, that's the whole story?
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"Sí.
"
11,6,Cartman,"All right, did you write the four essays?
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"Sí, we all wrote essays for you. 
"
11,6,The Boys,"All right!
"
11,6,Cartman,"Okay, let's have 'em.
"
11,6,Laborer 4,"Have what?
"
11,6,Kyle,"You said you all wrote essays.
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"Well, my ese lives in Miami. I wrote to him like you said, but I don't think he got the letter yet.
"
11,6,Laborer 2,"I wrote my ese in Albuquerque.
"
11,6,Laborer 5,"I wrote three eses: my ese back home, my ese in Denver, and my ese in Glenwood even wrote me back. ""Thanks for writing me, ese."" 
"
11,6,Kenny,"(Uh oh...)
"
11,6,Kyle,"Dude, we're totally fucked now!
"
11,6,Cartman,"Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"We thought it was kind of strange.
"
11,6,Kyle,"This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
"
11,6,Stan,"You guys, school starts in ten minutes!
"
11,6,Kyle,"Son of a bitch! 
"
11,6,Stan,"Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?
"
11,6,Clyde,"No, I got it done. 
"
11,6,Kyle,"Jimmy, did you finish your book report?
"
11,6,Jimmy,"Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. 
"
11,6,Cartman,"Crap! 
"
11,6,Kyle,"We're dead.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"Hello, class. Here's my little desk , my nice lil chalkboard. 
"
11,6,Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"Oho, that's okay Eric. If you need a little more time with your homework, just say so.
"
11,6,Kyle,"Really?
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"Kids, I need to tell you something that you might find shocking.  I'm gay. 
"
11,6,Stan,"Again?
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"It was a shock to me too. I... met another woman and... we went to this fabulous bar called ""Les Bos"" where I finally felt at home. Allyson and I talked, and really opened up to each other and... then we...  scissored all night long.
"
11,6,Butters,"You have to be careful with scissors.
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right?  Oh I'm so happy.
"
11,6,Cartman,"That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
"
11,6,Class,"Yay!
"
11,6,Mrs. Garrison,"Teeheeheehee.
"
11,6,Janet,"Hey Tracy, hey Kate.
"
11,6,Tracy,"Hi Janet.
"
11,6,Janet,"Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on? 
"
11,6,Linda,"Huh?
"
11,6,Janet,"Hey Patty.
"
11,6,Patty,"What's up, Janet.
"
11,6,Janet,"Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes.
"
11,6,Big Woman,"Hey Janet, why don't you pick up on your own girl? 
"
11,6,Janet,"Oh yeah, dyke fight!  You kicked me right in the pussy!  Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! 
"
11,6,Lesbian 4,"You guys. You guys, stop it. Listen to me, everybody. I got some bad news.
"
11,6,Lesbian 5,"What is it, Katie?
"
11,6,Katie,"They're closing down the bar. For good!
"
11,6,Linda,"Closing it down? They can't do that.
"
11,6,Lesbian 6,"This is our home.
"
11,6,Janet,"Yeah, this is our home.
"
11,6,Katie,"Well it's true, I just talked to the owners. They've sold the bar to Persians.
"
11,6,Janet,"Persians?!
"
11,6,Tracy,"So where are we supposed to go?
"
11,6,Janet,"We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!
"
11,6,Janet,"Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!
"
11,6,Mayor McDaniels,"You're a lesbian now?
"
11,6,Janet,"That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!
"
11,6,Mayor McDaniels,"The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.
"
11,6,Janet,"Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!
"
11,6,Lesbians,"Yeah, that's right!
"
11,6,Mayor McDaniels,"I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.
"
11,6,Janet,"Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!
"
11,6,Mayor McDaniels,"Mrs. Garrison, get out of here.
"
11,6,Tracy,"Well, here's to some great times at this place.
"
11,6,Lesbian 7,"Yeah. Guess we'll just have to find somewhere else to hang out.
"
11,6,Janet,"Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!
"
11,6,Allyson,"Well, what are we supposed to do, Janet?
"
11,6,Janet,"We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them ""We aren't leaving Les Bos.""
"
11,6,Katie,"Actually, it's ""Lebow"".
"
11,6,Janet,"No, it's Les Bos!  We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!
"
11,6,Linda,"The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.
"
11,6,Emir,"Hello, my name is Emir Hadi. My boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar.
"
11,6,Lesbian 6,"Yes, we are.
"
11,6,Emir,"Well, we want to assure you that when this place becomes another Club Persh, you will all still be 100% welcome. All they want is to make the place really nice. We're going to put down some lovely blue carpet, and gold curtain rods.
"
11,6,Janet,"I knew it! I knew it!
"
11,6,Emir,"But you are still welcome to come. My boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way.
"
11,6,Janet,"Would you allow straight people in? Men?
"
11,6,Emir,"Well... we would allow whoev-
"
11,6,Janet,"Choose your next words wisely, Persian! 
"
11,6,Emir,"Look uhh, we don't have to offer you anything, so... I don't know why you're being so difficult. This is crazy.
"
11,6,Janet,"No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos! 
"
11,6,Emir,"Ohhhhh!
"
11,6,Persian,"How dare you! 
"
11,6,Narrator,"And so it had begun. By kicking the Persian messenger in the balls, the lesbos had sent a message. . All over the country lesbians heard of the brave standoff.
"
11,6,Anchor,"As a group of lesbians in Colorado are refusing to allow the new owners of their bar in.
"
11,6,Lesbian 8,"Good for them!
"
11,6,Lesbian 9,"You go girls! 
"
11,6,Narrator,"The Persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in.
"
11,6,Persian 2,"Well fine. If they're going to block the entrance, we'll just bring like, sixty of us! I'll call more Persians for help. 
"
11,6,Narrator,"The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the Persians from entering.
"
11,6,Lesbian 6,"Here they come. 
"
11,6,Big Woman,"There's so many of them.
"
11,6,Janet,"Lesbos! Positions! 
"
11,6,Persian 2,"Lesbians! Stand aside. We're coming in to redecorate it!
"
11,6,Janet,"The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!
"
11,6,Persian 2,"All right! Come on! They can't stop all of us! Huuu!
"
11,6,Persians,"Huuu! 
"
11,6,Janet,"Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight!  Don't give them an inch!  Ow! Iranian faggot!
"
11,6,Persian 2,"Come on, seriously, let us in!
"
11,6,Janet,"Never!
"
11,6,Narrator,"For hours, the Lesbos kept the Persians back, holding them off, keeping them from decorating.  Finally the Persians grew tired. and many of them wanted to go shopping for more designer sunglasses. They retreated.  The Lesbos... had held.
"
11,6,Janet,"Lesbohhhs!
"
11,6,Lesbians,"Huok! Huok!
"
11,6,Narrator,"The Persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss.
"
11,6,Persian 2,"Here he comes. 
"
11,6,Narrator,"Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer with customized Gucci accessories which only a Persian would think was cool. 
"
11,6,Persian 2,"Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move. We could not get inside to redecorate.
"
11,6,Xerxes,"Tumon, how could you have failed me in this simple task? I am so seriously pissed off right now. I could bust a testicle.
"
11,6,Narrator,"And with that the Persian club owner came to a realization.
"
11,6,Xerxes,"I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself.
"
11,6,Janet,"Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.
"
11,6,Allyson,"Well that's great, Janet, but what now? We can't just stay here pushing them away our whole lives.
"
11,6,Janet,"We can't? I think it's pretty fun.
"
11,6,Linda,"We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.
"
11,6,Lesbian 10,"Maybe we can dig up some dirt on the club owner.
"
11,6,Janet,"Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.
"
11,6,Allyson,"Whattaya mean?
"
11,6,Janet,"If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!
"
11,6,Allyson,"But who's gonna spy on them for us? We don't know any Persians.
"
11,6,Janet,"It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.
"
11,6,Janet,"¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"Yeis.
"
11,6,Laborer 2,"We looking work, sí.
"
11,6,Janet,"All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.
"
11,6,Laborer 2,"Okay.
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"Sure.
"
11,6,Laborer 3,"Okay.
"
11,6,Laborer 4,"Yeah.
"
11,6,Allyson,"Janet, how is this gonna work? They don't look Persian.
"
11,6,Janet,"Sure they do.  Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne.  Persian.
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"Sí. 
"
11,6,Lesbian 6,"Wow!
"
11,6,Janet,"All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"Okay.
"
11,6,Laborer 5,"No problem.
"
11,6,Laborer 2,"Yes.
"
11,6,Laborer 4,"Sí. 
"
11,6,Janet,"And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.
"
11,6,Narrator,"A full day passed, and the Lesbos knew a second Persian attack was imminent. Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch, ready to alert the others. The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside. Her plan to dress Mexicans as Persians to act as spies - perhaps it had failed. She looked around at her fellow Lesbos. They were tired. In order to keep her Lesbos awake, she had no choice: she would have to make coffee.  With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos found new life, but would it be enough?
"
11,6,Lesbian 6,"The Persians are attacking again!
"
11,6,Janet,"Take positions, Lesbos!
"
11,6,Lesbian 11,"Get outside! 
"
11,6,Janet,"No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.
"
11,6,Linda,"Really?
"
11,6,Allyson,"How can you tell?
"
11,6,Janet,"Let them through. It's okay.
"
11,6,Laborer 3,"Hola, ¿como estas?
"
11,6,Laborer 4,"Hola.
"
11,6,Janet,"Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?
"
11,6,Laborer 4,"Ahh, no. They're not doing anything illegal.
"
11,6,Janet,"A-are you sure?
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"No, but we did find out a kind of secret about the person in charge.
"
11,6,Janet,"What secret?!  Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?
"
11,6,Laborers,"Sí.
"
11,6,Allyson,"Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here. He wants to talk to you and you alone.
"
11,6,Janet,"It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.
"
11,6,Xerxes,"Why are you lesbians being so difficult?
"
11,6,Janet,"Because we're protecting the only home we have.
"
11,6,Xerxes,"I don't know why you have to be all superlame about this.
"
11,6,Janet,"You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.
"
11,6,Xerxes,"Okay, how about this?  I will make you the manager of Club Persh. You'll make good money.
"
11,6,Janet,"That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you.  I know you're actually a woman.
"
11,6,Xerxes,"How..? How did you find that out?
"
11,6,Janet,"I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.
"
11,6,Xerxes,"You don't understand. Women can't be the boss in Persian culture. Nobody can know about this.
"
11,6,Janet,"Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking.  But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!
"
11,6,Xerxes,"You do? Seriously?
"
11,6,Janet,"Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?
"
11,6,Xerxes,"No. I don't even know how two women... can make love. Unless they just kind of  scissor or something.
"
11,6,Janet,"Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!
"
11,6,Xerxes,"Ohh, that feels so supercool!
"
11,6,Janet,"Yeah, scissor!
"
11,6,Xerxes,"Ohh, I'm a new woman!
"
11,6,Narrator,"And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails.
"
11,6,Janet,"Thanks for everything, Xerxes.
"
11,6,Xerxes,"No. Thank you, friend.
"
11,6,Allyson,"Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now?
"
11,6,Janet,"The school hired a substitute to cover for me.
"
11,6,Laborer 1,"Hand so to find the sum of the two fractions, zhyou must always first check for the lowest common denominator. 
"
11,6,Laborer 2,"Sí.
"
11,6,Laborers,"Sí. Sí. Yes. Yes. That's right.
"
11,6,Laborer 4,"Sí.
"
11,6,Stan,"These guys are pretty good.
"
11,6,Kyle,"Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. 
"
11,7,Cartman,"All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
"
11,7,Kyle,"Fine.
"
11,7,Stan,"Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?
"
11,7,Bum,"Spare some change?
"
11,7,Cartman,"Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!
"
11,7,Kyle,"You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
"
11,7,Stan,"Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
"
11,7,Kenny,"(Yeah, what are we supposed to do?)
"
11,7,Cartman,"No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
"
11,7,Kyle,"Really?
"
11,7,Cartman,"Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
"
11,7,Butters,"Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
"
11,7,Cartman,"Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?
"
11,7,Stan,"Yeah, it's all set.
"
11,7,Clyde,"He won't make it.
"
11,7,Kyle,"Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
"
11,7,Cartman,"All right, here we go! Jimmy? 
"
11,7,Bum,"Oh! Aww.
"
11,7,Cartman,"Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!
"
11,7,Kenny,"(Yehes!)
"
11,7,Stan,"That was a sweet idea, Kyle. 
"
11,7,Kyle,"God damn it, that wasn't my idea!
"
11,7,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do? 
"
11,7,Fire Chief,"Well, I, I short of had an idea.
"
11,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Please, Mr. Valmer.
"
11,7,Mr. Valmer,"We could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers. At least that way they'd be pleasant to look at.
"
11,7,Other Members,"Oh, that's a good one. Good idea. I like it.
"
11,7,Randy,"Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.
"
11,7,Mr. Valmer,"Ohh, that's a good one.
"
11,7,Mr. Mackey,"Nice one, Randy.
"
11,7,Gerald,"Like it.
"
11,7,Aide,"That's like recycling.
"
11,7,Mrs. Testaburger,"All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me!
"
11,7,Randy,"You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more.
"
11,7,Kyle,"Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 
"
11,7,Bum,"Got any more?
"
11,7,Kyle,"No, that... I thought that was a lot.
"
11,7,Bum,"Spare any change?
"
11,7,Kyle,"You're welcome. 
"
11,7,Kyle,"Oh crap. 
"
11,7,Stan,"Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
"
11,7,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
11,7,Cartman,"There's a bunch outside my house too.
"
11,7,Bum,"Spare any change, sir?
"
11,7,Cartman,"No! Fuck off! 
"
11,7,Stan,"I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
"
11,7,Kyle,"He did?
"
11,7,Cartman,"Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
"
11,7,Kyle,"Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
"
11,7,Cartman,"You what?!
"
11,7,Kyle,"Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
"
11,7,Stan,"Kyle, what were you thinking?
"
11,7,Cartman,"Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
"
11,7,Kyle,"I don't want you to jump them, retard!
"
11,7,Bum 1,"Spare some change?
"
11,7,Randy,"No, sorry, I don't have any change.
"
11,7,Bum 2,"Got any change?
"
11,7,Randy,"No, sorry. 
"
11,7,Bum 3,"Can you spare some change? 
"
11,7,Bum 4,"Chaaange?
"
11,7,Randy,"Huh! I don't have any change. 
"
11,7,Bum 5,"Change?
"
11,7,Randy,"No!
"
11,7,Bum 6,"Change? 
"
11,7,Bum 7,"Spare some change?
"
11,7,Randy,"Leave me alone I don't have any change!
"
11,7,Bum 7,"All right, God bless you, sir.
"
11,7,Randy,"Oh, now I feel bad.  Here!  Ahh!  Hahh!  Nono, that was really all the change I had.
"
11,7,Bum 7,"Spare some change?
"
11,7,Randy,"I just gave you change!
"
11,7,Bum 8,"Change? 
"
11,7,Randy,"Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! 
"
11,7,Gerald,"Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.
"
11,7,Randy,"Waaah!  Awwww!  Stay away!  Stay awayhay!
"
11,7,Jimbo,"Randy? Randy, what happened?
"
11,7,Randy,"Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!
"
11,7,Announcer,"This is a News 5 Special Bulletin, with Chris Swollenballs.
"
11,7,Chris Swollenballs,"South Park has become overrun with the homeless.  Nearly every square inch of public property is now riddled with homeless, shutting down roadways and making getting around impossible.  Many people are trapped throughout the town. 
"
11,7,Randy,"Help! Help us!
"
11,7,Stan,"Dude, it's our dads.
"
11,7,Kyle,"Oh my God.
"
11,7,Chris Swollenballs,"In the meantime, South Park citizens are being advised to stay indoors and protect their change.
"
11,7,Bum 9,"Spare some change?
"
11,7,Chris Swollenballs,"What the? You can't be in here.
"
11,7,Bum 9,"Ya got any change, sir?
"
11,7,Chris Swollenballs,"No I don't have any change. How did he get in here?
"
11,7,Bum 10,"Chaaaaange?
"
11,7,Chris Swollenballs,"No, please. I don't have any change. Honest I don't. I don't have any- 
"
11,7,Cartman,"You see what you did, Kyle?!
"
11,7,Stan,"Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 
"
11,7,Cartman,"They're everywhere!
"
11,7,Aide,"What are you boys doing? Get in.
"
11,7,Bum 11,"Spare any change, sir?
"
11,7,Aide,"Ahhhh!  Come on, let's go!  What the hell were you doing outside?!
"
11,7,Stan,"Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
"
11,7,Aide,"You aren't getting into town! It's completely overrun with these... things. 
"
11,7,The Boys,"Ahh! 
"
11,7,Aide,"No! I don't need my windshield cleaned! Stop it! Stop iiit!  Look, our only hope is to talk to the homeless researcher out on Travis Street. He understands what's goin' on better than anybody. Just stick with me, kids. 
"
11,7,The Boys,"Aaahhh! 
"
11,7,Kyle,"Holy shit, dude! 
"
11,7,Stan,"Over here!  Jump down! Go! 
"
11,7,Cartman,"Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.
"
11,7,Kenny,"(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)
"
11,7,Cartman,"Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
"
11,7,Stan,"Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 
"
11,7,Randy,"No sign of anybody else.
"
11,7,Gerald,"That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
"
11,7,Randy,"Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.
"
11,7,Stephen,"And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere.
"
11,7,Gerald,"If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.
"
11,7,Randy,"You won't make it through, Gerald! 
"
11,7,Gerald,"Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh.
"
11,7,Bums,"Change? Change sir? You got some change?
"
11,7,Gerald,"Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.   There! There's some change. All right, a little bit.  There you go. Take the change.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?
"
11,7,Bum 12,"Change, sir?
"
11,7,Gerald,"Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?  Change. Change? 
"
11,7,Stephen,"What happened?
"
11,7,Randy,"He's become one of them.
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Go away, I I don't have any change.
"
11,7,Stan,"Are you the head of Homeless Studies?
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Yes. Who are you?
"
11,7,Stan,"We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Oh my God. Get in here! Tell me what's going on? 
"
11,7,Stan,"There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
"
11,7,Cartman,"All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Jump them?
"
11,7,Cartman,"I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
"
11,7,Kyle,"Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
"
11,7,Cartman,"I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
"
11,7,Kyle,"You barely made it over one, fatass!
"
11,7,Stan,"Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
"
11,7,Kyle,"God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite understand how the homeless function. Perhaps you should come downstairs. To my laboratory. 
"
11,7,Randy,"We don't have any change! Go away!
"
11,7,Linda,"Anything, Stephen?
"
11,7,Stephen,"No. All the phone lines are completely down. 
"
11,7,A Man,"Hello? Ih-it's Steve Garrett from the library. Pu-please let us in.
"
11,7,Randy,"Find another place to hide, Steve!
"
11,7,Steve,"I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.
"
11,7,Stephen,"We can't just leave them out there.
"
11,7,Steve,"Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change.
"
11,7,Linda,"You have to let them in, Randy.
"
11,7,Randy,"There isn't enough food for more people up here!
"
11,7,Steve,"Oh God. One of them is a war veteran.  We're gonna have to give him some change.
"
11,7,Stephen,"This isn't happening!
"
11,7,Randy,"All right all right, fine! 
"
11,7,Bum 13,"Could you spare some change, sir?
"
11,7,Randy,"Harrrh!
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"I've dissected several homeless to see what make them tick. Their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours. See? Everything is there: heart, lungs, kidneys, they're almost identical to us in every way. Except for one.  The homeless... can survive solely... on change. 
"
11,7,Bum 14,"Change?
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"They feed on our change. They need it in order to keep them moving
"
11,7,Bum 14,"Is that... is that some spare change?
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Somehow they're able to take... our change... and turn it into nourishment, sustenance.
"
11,7,Bum 14,"Spare some of that change, sir?
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"But now watch. 
"
11,7,Bum 14,"Spare some change?
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"It has already completely forgotten that I've given it change. It just wants... more, change. Look over here.  This one I've kept deprived of change for over three days.
"
11,7,Bum 15,"Chaaaaange?
"
11,7,Kyle,"What's it doing?
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"It's dying.
"
11,7,Cartman,"Cool.
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did. And they were able to stop it.
"
11,7,Gerald,"Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? 
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Oh my God, they're coming in!  Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit!
"
11,7,Kyle,"What about you?
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!
"
11,7,Cartman,"Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
"
11,7,Gerald,"Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?
"
11,7,Bum 16,"Change?
"
11,7,Bum 17,"Spare some change?
"
11,7,Bum 18,"Change?
"
11,7,Gerald,"Stop it! I really do need change!
"
11,7,Bum 16,"Me too. Change?
"
11,7,Gerald,"Change?  Hello? Do you have any change?
"
11,7,Bum,"Chaaange?
"
11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Sorry to take the easy way out.  OW! OH, FUCK! OWW!  OHHH! AH! GOD! 
"
11,7,Randy,"No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.
"
11,7,Jimbo,"No. We can't be.
"
11,7,Randy,"Face it, we're gonna starve!
"
11,7,Linda,"No, no wait, there's still a box over here.
"
11,7,Randy,"Those are cherry! Ich!
"
11,7,Head of Public Safety,"Wait, I got a signal! I got a signal. 
"
11,7,Gerald,"What? You do?
"
11,7,Randy,"How? Call the fire department.
"
11,7,Head of Public Safety,"I'm calling my wife!  Mary. Mary baby, are you all right?
"
11,7,Linda,"Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay.
"
11,7,Stephen,"Ask her what's happening.
"
11,7,Head of Public Safety,"Mary, what's goin' on out there? Nobody's coming for us. They what? No! That's impossible. But how can that be? We didn't even-  Hello? Mary.  Mary!
"
11,7,Jimbo,"What happened, Glen?
"
11,7,Glen,"There's no help coming! She said... because of all the homeless... because of all the homeless in South Park property values have plummeted. I had two liens against my house and so the bank is foreclosing! I don't have a home anymore. 
"
11,7,Linda,"Randy, what are you doing?
"
11,7,Randy,"He's homeless now. We aren't safe.
"
11,7,Glen,"I'm not like them.
"
11,7,Randy,"Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
"
11,7,Linda,"And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?
"
11,7,Randy,"If we have to! Siddown Glen!
"
11,7,Glen,"Randy, you can't just-
"
11,7,Randy,"SIT... doowwwnnnn!
"
11,7,Glen,"This is crazy. How can they just take away my house? Where am I supposed to put all my things? I don't have a place for all my stuff; where am I supposed to put all my stuff? I'll need to pay for storage. Can I borrow some- money to put my stuff in storage? Come on guys. If you all just help me out a little bit. Each one of you just put in a little... change? Change? 
"
11,7,Stan,"What the hell happened here? 
"
11,7,Man 1,"That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!
"
11,7,Stan,"We, just came to ask a question.
"
11,7,Man 2,"You homeless or homeowners?
"
11,7,Kyle,"We're nine.
"
11,7,Man 1,"Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!
"
11,7,Stan,"Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
"
11,7,Cartman,"Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
"
11,7,Kyle,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
11,7,Man 1,"Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
"
11,7,Cartman,"Youu heard about that?
"
11,7,Man 2,"Heard about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.
"
11,7,Cartman,"Thirty was hard enough.
"
11,7,Kyle,"Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
"
11,7,Stan,"Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
"
11,7,Cartman,"Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.
"
11,7,Man 2,"Well, that was easy. 
"
11,7,Man 1,"The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know!  Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War!  That's when I started suspecting that  my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept.  After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all. 
"
11,7,Kyle,"You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 
"
11,7,Man 1,"That's right, yes.
"
11,7,Stan,"What?
"
11,7,Kyle,"I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
"
11,7,Man 1,"And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!
"
11,7,Stan,"But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!
"
11,7,Man 1,"Right. But we survived.
"
11,7,Woman,"Dehhhnyihhhs! 
"
11,7,Dennis,"Christine!
"
11,7,Christine,"You sonothatitch! You tried to kinn me!
"
11,7,Dennis,"I had to, Christine, you were homeless.
"
11,7,Christine,"No, I wasn't honeless yeh stukid asshole!
"
11,7,Dennis,"Christine, I can't understand you.
"
11,7,Christine,"Yeah! Gecause you durned my yits oth!
"
11,7,Dennis,"I nurned your rip sauce?
"
11,7,Christine,"No! You durned my yits oth!
"
11,7,Dennis,"I have no idea what you're saying!  Ow! 
"
11,7,Stan,"Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
"
11,7,Kyle,"No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.
"
11,7,Stan,"No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
"
11,7,Kyle,"That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
"
11,7,Kenny,"(What are you gonna do?)
"
11,7,Kyle,"We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
"
11,7,Randy,"A bus! A bus is coming!
"
11,7,Jimbo,"It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!
"
11,7,Stephen,"I knew they'd come back for us!
"
11,7,Linda,"All right!
"
11,7,A Woman,"Yeah.
"
11,7,Randy,"Look, Glen. We're saved. 
"
11,7,Stan,"All right, I'm turning around
"
11,7,Stephen,"Why are they turning?
"
11,7,Randy,"What are they doing?  Don't leave us!
"
11,7,Kyle,"All right, hit it.
"
11,7,Cartman,"Let's hope to Christ this works.

"
11,8,Mom,"Yes, I'm sorry. My son has Tourette's Syndrome.
"
11,8,Clerk,"Tourette's Syndrome?
"
11,8,Mom,"It's a neurological disorder. He-he can't control what he says.
"
11,8,Clerk,"Oh...
"
11,8,Boy,"Shiit!  Dumb shiiit!
"
11,8,Mom,"A-alright Thomas, maybe we should go?
"
11,8,Thomas,"All right Mom- Bitch! Ass bitch!
"

"
11,8,Thomas,"Cocknut! Augh... Stupid shit!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Are you talkin' to me?!
"
11,8,Thomas,"No. Cocknose!
"
11,8,Cartman,"What's your problem, kid?!
"
11,8,Mom,"Oh, a-I'm sorry.  My... son Thomas has Tourette's Syndrome. 
"
11,8,Cartman,"What?
"
11,8,Thomas,"Mom, let's just go. Shhhit!
"
11,8,Mom,"People with Tourette's can't control certain tics. It's it's like a sneeze.
"
11,8,Thomas,"Asshole ASSHOLE.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
"
11,8,Thomas,"Mom, can we just go home, please?
"
11,8,Mom,"It's okay, Thomas. They understand.
"
11,8,Thomas,"I want tuh go!  Shitfag!
"
11,8,Man 1,"Poor kid.
"
11,8,Clerk,"Yeah.
"
11,8,Cartman,"All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?
"
11,8,Clerk,"It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.
"
11,8,Man 1,"Yeah! 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Twinkle in my eye.  haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. 
"
11,8,Clerk,"Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?
"
11,8,Cartman,"I don't need the toy! I've found something better!  'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
"
11,8,Liane,"It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Puh- pussy!
"
11,8,Liane,"Oh...
"
11,8,Cartman,"Pussy! Cock! Shit! 
"
11,8,Liane,"Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called ""Tour, Tourette's Syndrome""?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! 
"
11,8,Doctor,"That doesn't seem likely. Tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.
"
11,8,Cartman,"...Cocksucker!
"
11,8,Doctor,"...On the other hand, Tourette's does often develop later in a child's life, getting progressively worse.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
"
11,8,Liane,"Oh Doctor, can you help him?
"
11,8,Doctor,"We don't know very much about Tourette's I'm afraid. But we will give your son all the help we can.
"
11,8,Cartman,"But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
"
11,8,Doctor,"Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
"
11,8,Kyle,"Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!
"
11,8,Principal Victoria,"Good morning, Eric. 
"
11,8,Kyle,"Did Cartman just say ""shitballs"" to the principal?
"
11,8,Butters,"Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
"
11,8,Kyle,"What?
"
11,8,Craig,"He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say ""shitballs"" to the principal I'd be sooo happy.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.
"
11,8,Principal Victoria,"It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.
"
11,8,Kyle,"He's faking.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
"
11,8,Kyle,"You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!
"
11,8,Cartman,"...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.
"
11,8,Kyle,"Who cares about saying whatever you-?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
"
11,8,Kyle,"Grrhh, whatever. 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! 
"
11,8,Craig,"If I could say ""asspussy"" to the counselor I would be sooo happy.
"
11,8,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Dicktits!
"
11,8,Mrs. Garrison,"-when we multiply a negative number by another negative-?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me. 
"
11,8,Mrs. Garrison,"Ih if we apply what we've just learned, we see that all negatives can-
"
11,8,Cartman,"Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
"
11,8,Mrs. Garrison,"All right kids, let's just try to focus on learning, okay?  Now all you need to remember here is that negative numbers
"
11,8,Cartman,"Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
"
11,8,Kyle,"Will you knock it off already?!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
"
11,8,Kyle,"Don't push me, asshole!
"
11,8,Mrs. Garrison,"Kyle, watch your language! 
"
11,8,Craig,"If I could yell ""tampon dickshit"" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy.
"
11,8,Mrs. Garrison,"Principal Victoria, it's just that Eric has become such a distraction I, I don't think I can teach my class anymore.
"
11,8,Principal Victoria,"I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. 
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"Hello Mrs. Garrison-  Ass. ASS.  I want to help your class better understand this illness.  Piss!
"
11,8,Kyle,"No! Up yours, fatboy!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Kyle please! I'm sorry!
"
11,8,Kyle,"Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"Faking?  You think people with Tourette's are faking?!
"
11,8,Kyle,"N-no, I'm just saying that I think-
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"Do you have any idea how horrible that is to say?  Ass! ASS!  We aren't ""faking"", young man. Trust me, nobody wants this illness, ass.  PISS! PIIISS!
"
11,8,Cartman,"That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"This is the kind of intolerance you teach at this school, Principal Victoria?!
"
11,8,Principal Victoria,"No.
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"This if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take this ""bully"" to see that Tourette's is very real.  Piiiss.
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"Kids, today during therapy class we have a special visitor.  ASS!  I, I wanted him to meet all of you so he could try to understand Tourette's
"
11,8,Teen Boy,"Tourette's is like a cough or a sneeze.  Brrrrr!  It isn't contagious like some people think.  Brrrrrrrrr!
"
11,8,Blonde Girl,"A lot of people with Tourette's have different tics. My tic  is that I have to bend my neck and snap her fingers. But a lot of people don't even notice it. 
"
11,8,Thomas,"Aw shit! COCK!
"
11,8,Brunette,"Sometimes it can be embarrassing to have Tourette's, but I  Boop. I've learned I shouldn't be mad at myself.
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!
"
11,8,Kyle,"L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
"
11,8,Teen Boy,"Fun?  Brrrrr!  This really isn't all that fun.  Brrr, brrrrrr!
"
11,8,Thomas,"Aw shit!
"
11,8,Brunette,"Boop. 
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"Piiiss, coming from my aaass!
"
11,8,Thomas,"Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents  Aw shit!  My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead.
"
11,8,Kyle,"Dude...
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"Your mom would not be better off if you were dead, Thomas. Even if people like Kyle here think so.
"
11,8,Kyle,"Aw, come on!
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"So then you apologize for what you said before?
"
11,8,Kyle,"Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"Well, Mr. and Ms. Broflovski, I think your son has learned a lot, and he appears to be honestly remorseful for making fun of people with disabilities.  Piss! PISS!
"
11,8,Sheila,"Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"Well, I think the only thing left now is for your son to apologize to his little classmate. 
"
11,8,Gerald,"Well Kyle?
"
11,8,Kyle,"I'm sorry.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
"
11,8,Kyle,"I'm sorry.
"
11,8,Cartman,"You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
"
11,8,Kyle,"I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
"
11,8,Sheila,"Oh, thank you Eric.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Thank you. Big-nosed kike! 
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"Well I think we can all put this behind us now.  Piiiss out my aaass!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome? 
"
11,8,Announcer,"Next week on Dateline NBC: it's a Dateline special report.
"
11,8,Hansen,"I'm Chris Hansen. You probably know me from To Catch A Predator, where we bust men looking for sex with children.
"
11,8,Hansen,"Go ahead and take a seat. Take a seat right over there.
"
11,8,Predator,"Oh God, Whoa no.
"
11,8,Hansen,"What are you doin' here?
"
11,8,Predator,"I'm just' bein' stupid, I guess.
"
11,8,Hansen,"But now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to Tourette's Syndrome. It all started when I received this touching letter from a brave little boy in Colorado.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman
"
11,8,Hansen,"This Saturday on Dateline I'll be bringing you Eric's story, live and uncensored, from his home in Colorado.
"
11,8,Announcer,"Living with Tourette's: The Eric Cartman Story. This Saturday on Dateline NBC.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!
"
11,8,Kyle,"What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
"
11,8,Kyle,"Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
"
11,8,Kyle,"...Scotch?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
"
11,8,Kyle,"You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Then the game is on, Kyle.
"
11,8,Kyle,"It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? ""Big titties! Buttmunch!"" There's no walls anymore! ""Shit!"" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. ""I wet my bed last night."" 
"
11,8,Kyle,"What did you say?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Uhh nuh-nothing...
"
11,8,Kyle,"You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Hm. That was... weird.
"
11,8,Mr. Donaldson,"We are here today to congratulate a brave little boy. Tonight, Eric Cartman will go on television and become the spokesman for Tourette's Syndrome.  Piiiss out my aaass! 
"
11,8,Thomas,"The spokesman for Tourette's? Oh no...  Cock!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. 
"
11,8,Craig,"If I could say ""titty sprinkles"" on national television I would be sooo happy.
"
11,8,Cartman,"And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?
"
11,8,Mr. Mackey,"Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay?
"
11,8,Cartman,"No hey ut what, what I meant to say was ""asslicker cumballs."" And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 
"
11,8,Patty,"Eewwww!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 
"
11,8,Butters,"Uh hey Eric!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
"
11,8,Butters,"Wuh who are you talking about?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! 
"
11,8,Butters,"You... you and your cousin touched wieners?
"
11,8,Cartman,"I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!
"
11,8,Liane,"Is there a problem, sweetie?
"
11,8,Cartman,"No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.
"
11,8,Mr. Mackey,"Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! 
"
11,8,Hansen,"Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrooome. I'm Chris Hansen. Mmh. I'm Chris Hansen.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
"
11,8,Hansen,"Why not?
"
11,8,Cartman,"My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
"
11,8,Hansen,"Why don't you have a seat?
"
11,8,Cartman,"No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
"
11,8,Hansen,"Go ahead and take a seat.
"
11,8,Cartman,"But I'm not gonna do the-
"
11,8,Hansen,"Take a seat, right over there.  What are you doing here?
"
11,8,Cartman,"I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
"
11,8,Hansen,"But you are doing the show.
"
11,8,Cartman,"You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
"
11,8,Hansen,"Well of course you can't control what you say. You have Tourehhtte's.
"
11,8,Cartman,"No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. 
"
11,8,Hansen,"Why don't you take a seat?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!
"
11,8,Hansen,"Have a seat.
"
11,8,Cartman,"No, I'm just gonna go- 
"
11,8,Hansen,"Take a seat, right over there.
"
11,8,Cartman,"How does he do that?
"
11,8,Hansen,"You know, one tiiime, I was doin' a show called ""To Catch A Predator"". We almost caught this pedophile, but then he raaan from us 'cause he didn't wanna be on Dateline. Se we tracked him down to his hoouuse. And you know what he did? He shot himself.  It'd be a shame if... you didn't wanna go on Dateline. Be a shame if we had to track you down and you ""shot yourself"". 
"
11,8,Announcer,"Live, from our satellite studio in Colorado. This! ...is Dateline.
"
11,8,Hansen,"Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrome. I'm  Chris Hansen. In a few minutes, you will meet little Eric Cartman, who wants the world to understand his affliction.
"
11,8,A Page,"Five minutes, kid.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!""  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
"
11,8,Kyle,"Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
"
11,8,Thomas,"Copy Foxtrot. Tango in position. Awww shit!
"
11,8,Kyle,"You sure you don't wanna back out?
"
11,8,Thomas,"Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!
"
11,8,Kyle,"All right, then we go with the plan. Just like ""To Catch A Predator"".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 
"
11,8,HotForBoys219,"Hi, are you CuteBilly182?
"
11,8,Thomas,"Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT!
"
11,8,HotForBoys219,"Oh God, I'm so turned on right now. This is your house? Your, your parents aren't home, are they?
"
11,8,Thomas,"N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT! I'm just gonna slip into something more comf'table. COCK!
"
11,8,HotForBoys219,"Okay. Cock! Don't take too long. 
"
11,8,Hansen,"So now let's meet a child who haaas Tourette's Syndrooome, and who must fi- 
"
11,8,HotForBoys219,"Ho, whoa, wait a minute. This ain't no house.
"
11,8,Hansen,"What are you doing?!
"
11,8,HotForBoys219,"Chris Hansen?! Oh no, it's a setup! I knew it!
"
11,8,Hansen,"Sir, why don't you take a seat, right over there.
"
11,8,HotForBoys219,"Now everyone's gonna know I'm a perv! Whoa! 
"
11,8,Hansen,"Aw, not again.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Kyle?
"
11,8,Kyle,"Surprise, fatass!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Kyle, what are you doing?
"
11,8,Kyle,"I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.
"
11,8,Pedo 2,"Hey, I brought you some Wendy's.
"
11,8,Thomas,"Yeah yeah, go on in. There's a hot tub inside. STUPID SHIT!
"
11,8,Pedo 2,"Score! 
"
11,8,Pedo 2,"Oh no, it's Chris Hansen! 
"
11,8,Audience Members,"Whoa! Who is that? What's going on?
"
11,8,Hansen,"What the hell is going on?!
"
11,8,Pedo 3,"Wait a minute. Oh God, it's Chris Hansen! 
"
11,8,Pedo 4,"Chris Hansen! 
"
11,8,Pedo 5,"Dateline?! 
"
11,8,Pedo 6,"I knew it! 
"
11,8,Pedo 7,"There aren't really brownies! 
"
11,8,Hansen,"Hey! Do you have something to do with this? Answer meee!
"
11,8,Thomas,"Stupid shit! Cock! 
"
11,8,Hansen,"What?! Nobody talks to me like that! Why don't you take a seat? Take a seat, right over there.
"
11,8,Thomas,"Suck it! Asshole licker dickfart!
"
11,8,Hansen,"Fine, you lil- I'll, I'll tell on you! 
"
11,8,Craig,"Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy.
"
11,8,Thomas,"You would?
"
11,8,Craig,"Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?
"
11,8,Kyle,"Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
"
11,8,Kyle,"What?
"
11,8,Cartman,"I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
"
11,8,Kyle,"No, I- I beat you!
"
11,8,Cartman,"You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! 
"
11,8,"Thomas, Kyle","Aww shit!
"
11,9,Dr. Doctor,"Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated. 
"
11,9,Randy,"Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!
"
11,9,Dr. Doctor,"Well, what food have you been eating?
"
11,9,Randy,"P.F. Chang's, mostly.  Good stuff.
"
11,9,Dr. Doctor,"I'm going to prescribe a laxative.  But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful.
"
11,9,Randy,"How painful is ""painful""?
"
11,9,Randy,"Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot!  Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot!  Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo.  Ohhh, it's over. It's over.  Oh God.  I feel so much better. Oh.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?
"
11,9,Sharon,"What is it, Randy? Do you have any-  OH!  Randy!
"
11,9,Randy,"Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
"
11,9,Sharon,"Flush the toilet for Christ's sake!
"
11,9,Randy,"Come on! That's pretty impressive!  Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. 
"
11,9,Sharon,"Randy!
"
11,9,Randy,"Look what your old man made.
"
11,9,Stan,"No way!
"
11,9,Randy,"Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?
"
11,9,Stan,"No, never.
"
11,9,Shelly,"Gross, Dad, sick! 
"
11,9,Sharon,"All right, will you flush the toilet now?! 
"
11,9,Randy,"I'll try, but I don't think-  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.
"
11,9,Sharon,"Why?!
"
11,9,Randy,"Well he's gotta see this.
"
11,9,Sharon,"No, we are flushing the toilet right now-
"
11,9,Randy,"No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!
"
11,9,Sharon,"Oh, for the love of God, Randy! 
"
11,9,Randy,"Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 
"
11,9,Randy,"Hey guys!
"
11,9,Gerald,"Hey Randy.
"
11,9,Stephen,"Oh, hey Randy.
"
11,9,Stuart,"Are you feelin' better?
"
11,9,Randy,"Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.
"
11,9,Jimbo,"You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.
"
11,9,Randy,"Well I don't know about ever...
"
11,9,Randy,"I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
"
11,9,Randy,"I guess it was pretty big.
"
11,9,Stuart,"A football? That's amazing.
"
11,9,Stephen,"I've never heard of one that big.
"
11,9,Gerald,"Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. 
"
11,9,Randy,"It wasn't bigger than mine was.
"
11,9,Gerald,"Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! 
"
11,9,Randy,"Mine... mine was bigger.
"
11,9,Gerald,"I doubt it. 
"
11,9,Randy,"You wanna see it?
"
11,9,Stuart,"Oh my freaking Lord.
"
11,9,Skeeter,"That did not seriously come out of your ass.
"
11,9,Randy,"Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.
"
11,9,Gerald,"Jesus...
"
11,9,Stan,"That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?
"
11,9,Gerald,"It's... other-worldly.
"
11,9,Stephen,"Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!
"
11,9,Randy,"That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. 
"
11,9,Sharon,"Randy Marsh!
"
11,9,Randy,"Aw crap!
"
11,9,Sharon,"What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!
"
11,9,Randy,"The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.
"
11,9,Sharon,"Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!
"
11,9,Secretary,"Guinness World Records America. How can I help you?  The biggest crap? We actually don't keep track of that record, sir.  Because we don't want to.  Look, we get calls from men all the time who believe they took the biggest crap, and we simply can't handle all the measuring and verification.  You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich.  You're welcome.  Jeez, another one.  Guinness World Records America.
"
11,9,Randy,"Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. 
"
11,9,Secretary,"You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. Their number is listed on their Web site.
"
11,9,Chubby Official,"Herr President, take a look at this.  It is a crap sent to us from the United States.
"
11,9,EFSM President,"Very niiice.  Has it been checked for accuracy?
"
11,9,Chubby Official,"It appears to be legitimate, based on the photo. We estimate that the crap is over eight and a half Courics!
"
11,9,EFSM President,"We'd better get on a plane. Right away. 
"
11,9,EFSM President,"Hm, enshnusen?
"
11,9,Chubby Official,"Verron snusunarich.
"
11,9,EFSM President,"What was your primary diet for this poo, Mr. Marsh?
"
11,9,Randy,"Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
"
11,9,Chubby Official,"I believe I detect some cabbage as well?
"
11,9,Randy,"Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.
"
11,9,Sharon,"You have got to be kidding me.
"
11,9,Randy,"These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! 
"
11,9,EFSM President,"It is a tremendous crap, Mr. Marsh.
"
11,9,Sharon,"For the love of God!
"
11,9,EFSM President,"Your crap officially weighs... 8.6 Courics
"
11,9,Randy,"Courics...
"
11,9,Chubby Official,"The standard measuring unit for human feces. One Katie Couric is approximately two and a half pounds of excrement.
"
11,9,EFSM President,"The current record is a crap weighing 7.5 Courics.
"
11,9,Randy,"But that means...
"
11,9,Third Official,"That's right. You are the new world's champion!
"
11,9,Randy,"Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! 
"
11,9,EFSM President,"Well, I guess we'd better call the old champion and let him know his record has just been broken.
"
11,9,M. C.,"He has won twenty-two Grammy's, countless humanitarian awards, and is the only person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and the Nobel Peace Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, Bono! 
"
11,9,Bono,"Thank you. Thank you so much for this newest award; it means so much.  Oh. Excuse me. I must be getting another award.  Yes?
"
11,9,EFSM President,"Yes, Bono, sir, we wish to inform you that your record for biggest crap has just been broken.
"
11,9,Bono,"What?! That's impossible! How big was it?
"
11,9,Senator,"We are here to honor the first American to bring home the distinguished EFSM medal for biggest crap ever taken. 
"
11,9,Randy,"Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!
"
11,9,Senator,"To present the award I give you the dean of the EFSM, Sir Orloff Broloff. 
"
11,9,Broloff,"Thank you, Senator. For over a hundred years, the European Fecal Standards and Meas-
"
11,9,Chubby Official,"Herr Broloff! Herr Broloff! 
"
11,9,Broloff,"Das shpoitenhoff?  Ahhh ladies and gentlemen, I understand we have just received a special video-taped announcement from Bono!
"
11,9,People in Crowd,"Oh! Bono? Cool!
"
11,9,Broloff,"Could we play the tape on the big screen, please?
"
11,9,Bono,"Hello everyone! I, am Bono.  For years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in Africa, and today, I have very exciting news. Last night, at twenty past eight, I took a crap weighing nine and a half Courics.
"
11,9,Crowd,"Whoa!
"
11,9,Sharon,"Bono?! 
"
11,9,Bono,"As you can see, it is one solid piece.  It is my biggest crap to date, and I swear to its authenticity. Thank you, and God bless. 
"
11,9,Broloff,"You heard it, ladies and gentlemen! The official biggest crap is... 9.5 Courics! Congratulations to Bono! 
"
11,9,Man,"Bo-no! Woo-ooo!
"
11,9,Stan,"Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.
"
11,9,Randy,"I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!
"
11,9,Stan,"Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.
"
11,9,Randy,"You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.
"
11,9,Sharon,"Come on guys, lasagna's ready.
"
11,9,Randy,"Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!
"
11,9,Sharon,"What are you talking about?
"
11,9,Randy,"You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!
"
11,9,Sharon,"Randy, this is ridiculous!
"
11,9,Randy,"Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 
"
11,9,Sharon,"Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!
"
11,9,Stan,"You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. 
"
11,9,Sharon,"Wha? Wha?
"
11,9,Jimbo,"How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?
"
11,9,Stuart,"'Cause he's Bono, that's why.
"
11,9,Stephen,"But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!
"
11,9,Randy,"Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
"
11,9,Gerald,"Oh yes there is! You could do it again!
"
11,9,Randy,"What?
"
11,9,Gerald,"Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!
"
11,9,Stephen,"Hey. Hey that's right.
"
11,9,Randy,"Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
"
11,9,Skeeter,"Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy!
"
11,9,Stuart,"With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?
"
11,9,Randy,"Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!
"
11,9,Stephen,"Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!
"
11,9,Randy,"I would need a lot of help.
"
11,9,Gerald,"That's what we're here for.
"
11,9,Jimbo,"Come on, Randy, what do you say?!
"
11,9,Randy,"I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!
"
11,9,Anchorman,"Tonight, a possible attack on Iran may mean the beginning of a new war in the Middle East.
"
11,9,Sharon,"Oh no.
"
11,9,Anchorman,"But first, the record for the world's biggest crap: will it again be broken?
"
11,9,Sharon,"Agh!
"
11,9,Anchorman,"Randy Marsh of Colorado is now three weeks into his quest to make a new crap, spending nearly every waking hour at P.F. Chang's. .
"
11,9,Female Anchor,"Is this really newsworthy?
"
11,9,Anchorman,"You just don't understand.
"
11,9,Female Anchor,"You're right. I don't.
"
11,9,Anchorman,"At the same time, some people are questioning Bono's current record entry, saying nobody has ever seen it in person. Bono could not be reached for comment, as he is currently in Africa helping the needy.
"
11,9,Bono,"Hello, hello.
"
11,9,Broloff,"Marsh is attempting to break the record again. We thought you should know.
"
11,9,Bono,"He can't beat my nine and a half Courics!
"
11,9,Broloff,"Well he's going to try.
"
11,9,Bono,"Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich.
"
11,9,Broloff,"Bono, we've never had that rule before.
"
11,9,Bono,"I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!
"
11,9,Assistant,"Ultrasound is very simple, Mr. Marsh. We're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly. Just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first. 
"
11,9,Randy,"Oooooo.
"
11,9,Assistant,"Okay, take a deep breath.  I see the crap now. I can't say for sure, but I, I'd say is about... 14 Courics.
"
11,9,Jimbo,"Fourteen?! 
"
11,9,Stephen,"That's great, Randy!
"
11,9,Randy,"Can I, can I see it?
"
11,9,Assistant,"Sure. This is your colon, a-and here...  is the feces growing inside your belly. 
"
11,9,Randy,"Ahhh...
"
11,9,Gerald,"Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.
"
11,9,Randy,"In Zurich?
"
11,9,Gerald,"They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
"
11,9,Assistant,"I'm sorry Mr. Marsh, I I cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition. It is never safe to fly during your turd trimester.
"
11,9,Stan,"Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?
"
11,9,Butler,"Mr. Bono, you have a young gentleman caller! 
"
11,9,Bono,"Get the jet ready, Bovis! I've got to be going. 
"
11,9,Stan,"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
"
11,9,Bono,"Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?
"
11,9,Stan,"That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
"
11,9,Bono,"Let him have it? Why would I do that?!
"
11,9,Stan,"Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.
"
11,9,Bono,"I have the first-place trophy for that.
"
11,9,Stan,"Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?
"
11,9,Bono,"I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.
"
11,9,Stan,"All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
"
11,9,Bono,"Number two?! NUMBER TWO?! 
"
11,9,Stan,"Agh!
"
11,9,Bono,"Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!
"
11,9,Stan,"I take it back!
"
11,9,Bono,"Say I'm not number two!
"
11,9,Stan,"You're not number two!
"
11,9,Bono,"That's right! I'm not! 
"
11,9,Stan,"What is wrong with that guy?
"
11,9,Butler,"Your father is in grave danger. Come with me! 
"
11,9,Chubby Official,"It must be quite a crap.
"
11,9,Jimbo,"Come on, Randy. You have to push! 
"
11,9,Stan,"What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
"
11,9,Butler,"Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before!
"
11,9,Stan,"So Bono's newest record is a lie!
"
11,9,Butler,"Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's first award for biggest crap. It said he took it in 1960.
"
11,9,Stan,"So?
"
11,9,Butler,"So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me. How could Bono be so talented, so caring, and yet seem like such a piece of crap? Because he is crap. Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder...
"
11,9,Stan,"He's the record.
"
11,9,Butler,"Yes.
"
11,9,Randy,"I can't do it! I can't do it!
"
11,9,Assistant,"The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean!
"
11,9,Randy,"But then, does it still count?
"
11,9,Bono,"Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out!
"
11,9,Broloff,"I believe that's true. We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but, if you cannot crap out the crap, it's not really a crap.
"
11,9,Randy,"No... Nooo...
"
11,9,Jimbo,"There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.
"
11,9,Randy,"I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon? 
"
11,9,Sharon,"What?!
"
11,9,Randy,"I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.
"
11,9,Broloff,"Well congratulations, Bono, it appears your record is intact.
"
11,9,Bono,"I had a feeling it would be.
"
11,9,Stan,"Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.
"
11,9,Bono,"Get him out of here!
"
11,9,Third Official,"What are you talking about, young man?
"
11,9,Stan,"Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
"
11,9,Bono,"It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!
"
11,9,Broloff,"It's too late, Bono. The boy has learned the truth.
"
11,9,Chubby Official,"Herr Broloff, what do you know of this?
"
11,9,Broloff,"It's true, I'm afraid. You see, until Mr. Marsh came along, I was the record holder for the biggest crap. I took it back in 1960. It was the most amazing crap I'd ever taken.
"
11,9,Bono,"Poppa no! Say nothing more!
"
11,9,Broloff,"Come to me my... darling precious child.  After I had broken the record I took the crap home. I was so proud of it that I... decided to keep it, to try and raise it like a child.
"
11,9,Bono,"No Poppa... No Poppa...
"
11,9,Broloff,"There there, my little crap.  Don't cry.  Here, do you want the biddy? Hm?  Does Bono want the biddy?  Yes, he likes the biddy doesn't he?
"
11,9,Stan,"Dude.
"
11,9,Broloff,"I kept the crap in my office, nursed it, fed it biddy. And soon biddy made him strong. Biddy made him grow up! Into one of the most influential figures of our time.  Easy Bono, that hurts the biddy.
"
11,9,Bono,"Biddy. 
"
11,9,Broloff,"My little crap has accomplished many things. But he could never shed the fact that he was really... a number two. So he spent his life trying to be number one, in everything.
"
11,9,Stan,"That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
"
11,9,Chubby Official,"You have blemished this noble society's good name, Herr Broloff.
"
11,9,Broloff,"Have I?!  Look at the crap I took all those years ago! Bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 Courics in weight! No matter how you look at it he IS still the record!
"
11,9,Randy,"Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot 
"
11,9,Third Official,"My God...
"
11,9,Chubby Official,"It must be over a hundred Courics!
"
11,9,Stan,"Dad, are you all right?
"
11,9,Randy,"Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better.
"
11,9,Chubby Official,"Mr. Marsh, we apologize, and if it's okay with you, we would like to present you... your long overdue trophy. 
"
11,10,Cartman,"All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 
"
11,10,Kyle,"This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
"
11,10,Cartman,"It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
"
11,10,Clyde,"This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. 
"
11,10,Cartman,"Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 
"
11,10,Kyle,"Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
"
11,10,Cartman,"O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?
"
11,10,Token,"... I don't want the code name Blackie.
"
11,10,Cartman,"Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! 
"
11,10,Kyle,"This is fucking retarded!
"
11,10,Cartman,"Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. 
"
11,10,Kyle,"Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
"
11,10,Cartman,"Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
"
11,10,Butters,"This is faggot. Go ahead.
"
11,10,Cartman,"Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
"
11,10,Butters,"Okay, will do. Faggot out.  Waagh.
"
11,10,Kyle,"Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
"
11,10,Cartman,"It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
"
11,10,Kyle,"You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
"
11,10,Butters,"Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
"
11,10,Cartman,"Set off diversion track C! 
"
11,10,Stan,"Dude...
"
11,10,Jimmy,"Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun.
"
11,10,Cartman,"Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! 
"
11,10,Butters,"Wow.
"
11,10,Stan,"Cool.
"
11,10,Craig,"No way.
"
11,10,Token,"Whoa.
"
11,10,Jason,"Wow.
"
11,10,Cartman,"Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
"
11,10,Leprechaun,"You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!
"
11,10,Cartman,"Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! 
"
11,10,Stan,"Where'd he go? 
"
11,10,Leprechaun,"I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, but you boys have made me late. Now the terrorists will prevail! The end is near! 
"
11,10,Craig,"Dude.
"
11,10,Cartman,"Kyle, suck my balls. 
"
11,10,Kyle,"Dad, where do leprechauns come from?
"
11,10,Gerald,"From Ireland.
"
11,10,Kyle,"So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
"
11,10,Sheila,"Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.
"
11,10,Kyle,"I thought I did. 
"
11,10,Cartman,"Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
"
11,10,Sheila,"Oh,hello Eric.  Kyle, your friend is here.
"
11,10,Cartman,"Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
"
11,10,Kyle,"Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
"
11,10,Cartman,"Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
"
11,10,Kyle,"I'm not doing it, fatass!
"
11,10,Gerald,"Doing what?
"
11,10,Cartman,"We had a deal, Kyle!
"
11,10,Kyle,"Just get out of here!
"
11,10,Cartman,"You signed an agreement, Kyle!!
"
11,10,Kyle,"I don't care if I signed an agreement!
"
11,10,Gerald,"Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.
"
11,10,Cartman,"Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.
"
11,10,Gerald,"What was the agreement?
"
11,10,Kyle,"That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
"
11,10,Sheila,"Whatwhatwhat?!
"
11,10,Cartman,"And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
"
11,10,Kyle,"Hey dudes. 
"
11,10,Jimmy,"Hey Kyle. So, ...how was it?
"
11,10,Kyle,"How was what?
"
11,10,Jimmy,"Sucking Cartman's b-balls.
"
11,10,Kyle,"I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
"
11,10,Stan,"Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.
"
11,10,Kyle,"Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"Excuse me. Have you boys seen a leprechaun anywhere lately?
"
11,10,Stan,"...What do you know about the leprechaun?
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"Ooooo, then you did see him.  That's splendiferous! I want you to tell me everything he said. Where was he? What was he doing?
"
11,10,Kyle,"All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"Well of course they are. But just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real. Haven't you boys ever used your imagination?  You young man! How would you like to be a cowboy? Or a- swashbuckling pirate?  And you! How would you like to be an astronaut, faaar out in space? All it takes is a little...  imagination.
"
11,10,Stan,"Who the hell are you?
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"Still not convinced, eh? I tell you what, boys. What say we all take a ride on my... Imagination Flying Machine? 
"
11,10,Kyle,"Dude.
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you.
"
11,10,Butters,"Uhhh, are you gonna rape us?
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"Ubeuh... uh... n... no?
"
11,10,Butters,"Ah, all right then.
"
11,10,Stan,"Come on, guys. 
"
11,10,Butters,"Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"All aboard the Imagination Balloon! 
Some people feel imagination isn't real, but I tell them that they're wrong,
'cause whenever I want to play and pretend, I just sing the Imagination Sooong
.
"
11,10,Kyle,"Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"Oh- Ohhh. But my boy, we're already here.
"
11,10,The Boys,"Whoa...
"
11,10,Stan,"What is this place?
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"This... is Imaginationland.  It's where all the wonderful and goofy things that humans have made up over the years live together.  Citizens of Imaginationland! We have distinguished guests from the world beyond! 
"
11,10,Cheetara,"Hello. 
"
11,10,Lollipop King,"Welcome to Imaginationland. I am the Lollipop King.
"
11,10,Mr. Tumnus,"We are honored to have Creators in our kingdom.
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"Now, good news, everyone! These boys did see the leprechaun! 
"
11,10,Pat the Hammer,"What did he tell you? Did he have any news?
"
11,10,Stan,"Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
"
11,10,A Terrorist,"ALLAH!!! 
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"OH FUCK NO! 
"
11,10,Charlie Brown,"Awwwgh! 
"
11,10,Cheetara,"AAAAAH!
"
11,10,Kyle,"STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 
"
11,10,Draco,"Quickly boys! Get on my back! 
"
11,10,Butters,"Fellas! Fellas wait!  Hold on, fellas!
"
11,10,Stan,"Butters.
"
11,10,Butters,"Don't leave me, fellas! Come back! 
"
11,10,Kyle,"Dude! 
"
11,10,Butters,"Hey guys!
"
11,10,The Boys,"Goodbye Butters.
"
11,10,Kyle,"A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 
"
11,10,Stan,"Hello?
"
11,10,Kyle,"Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
"
11,10,Stan,"No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
"
11,10,Kyle,"...And then it got attacked by terrorists?
"
11,10,Stan,"Yeah! How'd you know?
"
11,10,Kyle,"Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
"
11,10,Sharon,"Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen your little friend Butters, have you? 
"
11,10,Stan,"Why?
"
11,10,Linda,"Our darling Butters never came home last night.
"
11,10,Kyle,"What did they say??
"
11,10,Steven,"We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but... we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped Butters, sodomized him over and over again, and then fed his genitals to wild animals.  There there, darling.
"
11,10,Kyle,"...Dude...
"
11,10,General,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have dire news. Yesterday, at approximately 18:00 hours, terrorists successfully attacked... our imagination. 
"
11,10,Man 1,"Our imagination?
"
11,10,Woman 1,"How?
"
11,10,Specialist,"The imaginary attack appears to have been in the works for years. The effects of the attack are so far... unimaginable.
"
11,10,General,"We've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast. Luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public. 
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"No! It's just a Care Bear! 
"
11,10,Man 2,"Oh my God.
"
11,10,General,"Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement.
"
11,10,Butters,"Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 
"
11,10,General,"Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild.
"
11,10,Cartman,"I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
"
11,10,Judge,"Mr. Broflovski, did you agree to orally imbibe Mr. Cartman's scrotum and testicles?
"
11,10,Kyle,"I...
"
11,10,Judge,"Is this not your signature on the contract?
"
11,10,Kyle,"Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
"
11,10,Judge,"From what I've been presented and the evidence put forth, the court has no choice but to order you to place Mr. Cartman's pubicle sac in your mouth, and draw upon it succulently for no less than 30 seconds.
"
11,10,Cartman,"Yesss!
"
11,10,Judge,"You have twenty four hours to suck aforementioned balls. If after that time you still refuse, the court will be forced to arrest you for contempt. Next case! 
"
11,10,Cartman,"Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
"
11,10,General,"What I am about to tell you is highly classified. Two days ago, Muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination.  Frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them.
"
11,10,Specialist,"In times like these the government often turns to Hollywood for help. You creative filmmakers can think of idea we just can't.
"
11,10,General,"That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam.  The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists?
"
11,10,M. Night Shyalaman,"What if...  What if it turns out they aren't terrorists? But they're actually werewolves? From the future?
"
11,10,General,"N, no. No, they're terrorists. They've been linked to Al Qaeda.
"
11,10,M. Night Shyalaman,"But what if Al Qaeda, it turns out, is the group being terrorized? By aliens?
"
11,10,General,"No- No. That's not an idea, that's a twist. We need ideas.
"
11,10,M. Night Shyalaman,"How about we make everyone think that terrorists attacked us? But really, we were all already dead.
"
11,10,General,"Get him out of here.  Mr. Bay, can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists?
"
11,10,Michael Bay,"I believe I can.  We start... by making a big CG building and then we have a meteor go CROSSHH!  and it, and it's all like CRAAWWWLL  a-and motorcycles burst into flame while they jump over these helicopters, right? 
"
11,10,General,"No no! We need ideas how to stop the terrorists!
"
11,10,Michael Bay,"An eighteen-wheeler spins out of control and it's all like BROSSHH  And then this huuuge tanker full of dyna- 
"
11,10,General,"Those aren't ideas, those are special effects!
"
11,10,Michael Bay,"I... don't understand the difference.
"
11,10,General,"I know you don't. Get him out of here!  Aaand being that we are all big Mel Gibson film fans, we thought maybe you could help us.
"
11,10,Mel Gibson,"Ah, my nipples, they hurt! They hurt when I twist them!
"
11,10,General,"Yes, uh, I don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists?
"
11,10,Mel Gibson,"How about this? You have that tape that the terrorists made, right? Well, maybe if you did a background check on that videotape, you might find somebody who doesn't belong. Somebody who doesn't fit in Imaginationland! Ohhh!
"
11,10,Specialist,"Heyy... that's not a bad idea.
"
11,10,General,"Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it!
"
11,10,Mel Gibson,"Oogh! Yess! 
"
11,10,Specialist,"All the imaginary characters in the tape were identified, sir. Count Chocula, Cinderella, Snarf from Thundercats... But here.  Nothing in American folklore or storytelling match this kid. He appears to be... just some kid. 
"
11,10,General,"I want digital imaging and resource magnification done stat!  If that kid isn't imaginary, I want to know who he is, where he's from, and who his friends are!
"
11,10,Specialist,"Yes sir! 
"
11,10,General,"Who are you?...
"
11,10,Butters,"Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
"
11,10,Pat the Hammer,"Can you tell what the terrorists are doing?
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"They're going something to Rockety Rocket.
"
11,10,Rockety Rocket,"No! Leave me alone! Haaa!
"
11,10,Cinderella,"It doesn't make sense. What do they want with Rockety?
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"The only reason they would-  Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier!
"
11,10,Butters,"Uh what's the Barrier?
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"The wall! The wall which separates the evil side of Imaginationland from the good side! 
"
11,10,Rockety Rocket,"No! No you can't blow up the barrier! Are you insane?! 
"
11,10,Cinderella,"We can't let this happen.
"
11,10,Suitcase,"It will be the end of Imaginationland.
"
11,10,Pat the Hammer,"Yeah. You have to stop them, kid.
"
11,10,Butters,"Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"Don't you get it?! If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over Imaginationland for good! YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!!
"
11,10,Butters,"Waaahaa!
"
11,10,Cartman,"Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
"
11,10,Craig,"He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.
"
11,10,Cartman,"He has to. He's been ordered by the court.
"
11,10,Clyde,"Hey, he's here. 
"
11,10,Cartman,"What? Move aside, move aside! 
"
11,10,Stan,"Dude, do you really have to do it?
"
11,10,Kyle,"Let's just get this over with!
"
11,10,Cartman,"Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
"
11,10,Kyle,"God damnit!
"
11,10,Cartman,"Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! 
"
11,10,Specialist,"That's them, sir. Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski.
"
11,10,General,"You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security.
"
11,10,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
11,10,General,"There's no time! You need to come with us right now! 
"
11,10,Cartman,"Hey, let go of him! 
"
11,10,General,"We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information.
"
11,10,Cartman,"No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! 
"
11,10,Rockety Rocket,"No! Noooo! 
"
11,10,Butters,"Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
"
11,10,Terrorists,"ALLAH!! 
"
11,10,Rockety Rocket,"AAAAAAAH! Jesus Christ, no!! 
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"That was your plan to stop them??
"
11,10,Butters,"Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?
"
11,10,Fanciful Mayor,"That's fucking stupid!  They are coming... 
"
11,10,Driver,"Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'
"
11,10,Cartman,"Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.
"
11,10,Driver,"You goin' to Washington to visit family?
"
11,10,Cartman,"I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. 
"
11,11,Cartman,"Previously on Battlestar Galactica 
"
11,11,Stan,"What is this place?
"
11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"This... is Imaginationland.
"
11,11,A Terrorist,"ALLAH!!! 
"
11,11,Kyle,"WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
"
11,11,Butters,"Hold on, fellas!
"
11,11,The Boys,"Butters.
"
11,11,General,"Terrorists have just attacked... our imagination.
"
11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out!
"
11,11,Terrorists,"ALLAH!! 
"
11,11,Rockety Rocket,"No!! 
"
11,11,Steven,"Butters, time for breakfast.
"
11,11,Butters,"Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
"
11,11,Steven,"Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked waffles and nanas for you.
"
11,11,Butters,"Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.
"
11,11,Steven,"You are in Imaginationland. This is a dream.
"
11,11,Butters,"Huh?
"
11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"Hey, wake up, stupid!  Come on, wake up, kid!
"
11,11,Butters,"No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!
"
11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"NO! You passed out and peed your pants!
"
11,11,Cinderella,"Look! The evil of Imaginationland is coming out! 
"
11,11,Butters,"Oh hamburgers! 
"
11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest!  Come with me, little boy! I'm going to get you home! 
"
11,11,Butters,"WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 
"
11,11,Stan,"Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
"
11,11,General,"What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!
"
11,11,Kyle,"We just... went on a balloon ride.
"
11,11,Specialist,"There must have been some kind of portal or doorway.
"
11,11,Stan,"Dude, we don't remember.
"
11,11,General,"Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild!  You'd better start remembering!
"
11,11,Specialist,"It was the Chinese, wasn't it?
"
11,11,Kyle,"...What?
"
11,11,Specialist,"We've suspected that the Chinese government was working on a doorway to the imagination.  Is that where you were?!
"
11,11,Stan,"No.
"
11,11,General,"That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?
"
11,11,Specialist,"It is better than ours?
"
11,11,Stan,"Your what?
"
11,11,Specialist,"Our portal to the imagination built as a secret project back in 1962 to fight the Soviets-
"
11,11,General,"Shhh! Tom! That's super-secret.
"
11,11,Tom,"Ohh, I'm sorry sir.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
"
11,11,General,"Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?!
"
11,11,Tom,"Yes sir.  We built a portal to the imagination to use against the Russians during the Cold War, but we never got a-
"
11,11,General,"THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!
"
11,11,Tom,"Aw jeez, I'm really sorry sir.
"
11,11,Stan,"If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
"
11,11,General,"All right, we might as well show it to them.  God-dammit, Tom.
"
11,11,Cartman,"Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. ""Time to pay up, Kyle.""  But then...  ""NO! NOOO!""  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. 
"
11,11,Elderly woman,"You okay, kid?
"
11,11,Cartman,"NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
"
11,11,General,"Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called ""Project Imagination Doorway.""
"
11,11,Stan,"That's not very imaginative.
"
11,11,General,"According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has.
"
11,11,Lead tech,"But we're close, sir. We're real close.
"
11,11,General,"They've been saying that for over forty years.
"
11,11,Lead tech,"You're the ones, right? The kids who have been in the imagination.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Ah I guess.
"
11,11,Lead tech,"What was the sequence that got you inside? We know there's some kind of... resonance code, but we can't figure it out.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
"
11,11,General,"Song? You didn't say anything about a song before.
"
11,11,Lead tech,"What song?
"
11,11,Stan,"The Imagination song?
"
11,11,Lead tech,"That could be it. The fractal converter has never worked because it was waiting for a multitonal code!
"
11,11,General,"Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go?
"
11,11,"Stan, Kyle","Imaginaaaation Imaginaaaation
"
11,11,Operator,"Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something.
"
11,11,Lead tech,"Was there more to the Imagination Song? Ha, how does the rest of it go?
"
11,11,"Stan, Kyle","Imaginaaaation. Imaginaaaa-
"
11,11,Kyle,"No, no dude, it went up there.
"
11,11,Stan,"Imagina-he-hey-
"
11,11,Kyle,"Imagina-eh
"
11,11,Stan,"Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.
"
11,11,General,"I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety! 
"
11,11,Lollipop King,"Mayor, Mayor, what are we supposed to do?
"
11,11,Butters,"Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
"
11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times.
"
11,11,Butters,"Really?
"
11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"NO, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke! 
"
11,11,Snarf,"Mayor, what are we supposed to do, shnarf shnarf?
"
11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope!
"
11,11,Lollipop King,"Castle Sunshine?
"
11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"Through the Gumdrop Forest. Others will be hiding there; go, run! Look out for the evil characters! They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain! 
"
11,11,Orc,"We are free! Now all of Imaginationland is ours!
"
11,11,The Minotaur,"Not all, foolish orc! There are still parts of Imaginationland we don't control.
"
11,11,Freddy Krueger,"Tomorrow, we shall build our own castle right on this spot!
"
11,11,The Minotaur,"Who put you in charge, Krueger?! I am the most evil character here!
"
11,11,ManBearPig,"Nonsense!  Your evil is stale!
"
11,11,Headless Horseman,"I am the most evil imaginary character! 
"
11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,"Now come on y'all. We shouldn't be fightin', we're supposed to all be on the same side. 
"
11,11,Critter,"Yeah. You're all right, Squirrelly Squirrel.
"
11,11,Woodland Critters,"Yaaaay!
"
11,11,The Minotaur,"What evil imaginary characters are they?
"
11,11,Creature from the Black Lagoon,"They were dreamt up by some fourth grade kid as part of his Christmas Story..
"
11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,"Now come on y'all. We can't waste time arguing, there could still be survivors out there. We need to hunt them down, and kill them.
"
11,11,Rabbity Rabbit,"And eat their flesh!
"
11,11,Beavery Beaver,"B'hut first we should rape them!
"
11,11,Beary Bear,"How about we kill them, and then rape their bodies so we can use their blood as lubricant?
"
11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,"Say, that's a great idea, Beary Bear. 
"
11,11,Jason Voorhees,"Man, I do not want to meet the kid that dreamt THOSE things up.
"
11,11,Cartman,"Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
"
11,11,Secretary,"I'm sorry, sir. That information is classified.
"
11,11,Cartman,"Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
"
11,11,Secretary,"There's somebody asking a lot of questions about what's going on.
"
11,11,Tom,"Let me handle this!  I'm sorry, but there is no such thing as Project Imagination Doorway!  Imagination Doorway. It was started in the Sixties as a secret government project. Right.
"
11,11,"Stan, Kyle","Imagina-a-ation, Imagina-
"
11,11,Stan,"Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Right, then it was ""Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on"" 
"
11,11,Lead tech,"It's open! It's open!
"
11,11,Operator,"Getting readings from the other side... the, that's it. We've made an opening to our imagination, sir! 
"
11,11,General,"All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!
"
11,11,Butters,"How much further to Castle Sunshine?
"
11,11,Snarf,"Snarf, I'm not sure snarf snarf. I've never been. 
"
11,11,Butters,"What was that?
"
11,11,Lollipop King,"Over here.  Oh Christ. Its Strawberry Shortcake. 
"
11,11,Strawberry Shortcake,"Please, let me go.  Wuh.  Wuh!  Dugh! 
"
11,11,Snarf,"Oh my God! Snarf. 
"
11,11,Strawberry Shortcake,"Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah!
"
11,11,The Minotaur,"Now kill her!
"
11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,"Whoa whoa, hang on, y'all. You can't just kill her. That's not evil enough.
"
11,11,Freddy Krueger,"What do you mean? We cut out her eyeball.
"
11,11,Jason Voorhees,"Yeah, that's super hardcore.
"
11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,"Now come on y'all. We can do better than that.
"
11,11,Beavery Beaver,"Hey! I know! Let's all pee in her empty eye socket!
"
11,11,Deery Deer,"Let's make her eat her own eyeball, and then pee in her empty eyesocket.
"
11,11,Beary Bear,"How about we get someone with AIDS to pee in her eyesocket, so she dies all slowlike? 
"
11,11,The Minotaur,"Nobody here has AIDS!
"
11,11,Woodland Critters,"Awwww!!
"
11,11,Beary Bear,"But we've got to have AIDS before we pee in her eyesocket!
"
11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,"Now don't be down y'all. I bet we can find some AIDS out in the forest. 
"
11,11,Lollipop King,"Dude, run, run, ruuun! 
"
11,11,General,"All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready?
"
11,11,Soldiers,"Yes sir!
"
11,11,General,"Are you ready, Kurt Russell?
"
11,11,Kurt Russell,"I... I don't understand why I'm here. I I'm just an actor.
"
11,11,General,"Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard!
"
11,11,Tech 1,"Sir, we have a security breach!
"
11,11,General,"What?!
"
11,11,Tech 3,"There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
"
11,11,General,"Sector Two?? 
"
11,11,Kyle,"Cartman??
"
11,11,Cartman,"Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
"
11,11,General,"Who the hell are you?!
"
11,11,Cartman,"That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
"
11,11,General,"Get him out of here!
"
11,11,Cartman,"No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!
"
11,11,General,"Let me see that!  Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?
"
11,11,Kyle,"I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
"
11,11,General,"All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!
"
11,11,General,"You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Stan?
"
11,11,Stan,"Dude, you did make a deal... 
"
11,11,Cartman,"Theee conference room is which way? 
"
11,11,Cartman,"Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
"
11,11,Kyle,"I didn't ""bail,"" I got picked up by the government!
"
11,11,Cartman,"Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
"
11,11,Cartman,"Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
"
11,11,Cartman,"Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. 
"
11,11,Kyle,"No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
"
11,11,Cartman,"Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...
"
11,11,Kyle,"Just get to it already!
"
11,11,Lead tech,"Entering the portal in five seconds.
"
11,11,General,"Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?
"
11,11,Kurt Russell,"Check 1, 2.
"
11,11,General,"Good luck men! Godspeed!  What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me?
"
11,11,Kurt Russell,"We're here. We're s-somewhere.
"
11,11,Tech 3,"They are inside the imagination, sir.
"
11,11,General,"What do you see in there?
"
11,11,Kurt Russell,"There's lots of... big mushrooms, colorful grass, some castles in the distance, eh... Wait. Something's coming for us! It's coming out of the bushes and-  It's a-! ...Oh, Aw, it's just a cute little squirrel.  Hey, it talks, haha. The little squirrel talks.
"
11,11,Lead tech,"Awww, an imaginary talking squirrel.
"
11,11,Techs,"Awww.
"
11,11,General,"Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack.
"
11,11,Kurt Russell,"Wait a minute, eh. The squirrel has friends. Oh why, why it's a whole bunch of woodland critters.
"
11,11,Stan,"Wait, woodland critters... 
"
11,11,Kurt Russell,"There's a talking bear and a beaver, uh... the, they seem to be Christmas critters. Well hello. Yes, hi.
"
11,11,Stan,"Get them out of there!
"
11,11,General,"What?
"
11,11,Stan,"Tell them to get away now!
"
11,11,General,"What's the matter?
"
11,11,Kurt Russell,"Oh the... cute little bear's eyes are starting to glow red now... Uh hello there, little animals, do you happen to know how to huh? OW! AAAAAAAHHHH!
"
11,11,General,"Kurt Russell, what's going on?!
"
11,11,Kurt Russell,"They're raping mee!! They're raping meee!!!
"
11,11,General,"Get out of there, Kurt Russell!
"
11,11,Kurt Russell,"They're raping all of us! Whoaho! Oh it hurts! They're raping us and it huuurts! Waaagh!
"
11,11,Cartman,"I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
"
11,11,Kyle,"Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
"
11,11,Cartman,"No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
"
11,11,Kyle,"Let's just DO IT! 
"
11,11,Cartman,"In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- 
"
11,11,Guard,"Everyone to the main hall now! Go!
"
11,11,Cartman,"Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
"
11,11,Guard,"Everyone to the main hall NOW! 
"
11,11,Cartman,"No! Goddammit no!
"
11,11,Snarf,"Boy snarf snarf, my feet are really gettin' tired snarf.
"
11,11,Butters,"Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?
"
11,11,Lollipop King,"Wait! There it is. We made it!  Castle Sunshine!  Hurry! Get inside! 
"
11,11,Perseus,"The evil imaginary characters are approaching! Lock down the gates! Prepare to fire the cannons! 
"
11,11,Butters,"Wait! Waaait! 
"
11,11,Perseus,"What imaginary character are you?!
"
11,11,Lollipop King,"The Lollipop King? From the Lollipop Forest?
"
11,11,Snarf,"And I'm Snarf. Snarf, snarf snarf snarf.
"
11,11,Perseus,"And what imaginary character are you?
"
11,11,Butters,"Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
"
11,11,Perseus,"What's a ""Butters""?
"
11,11,Snarf,"The Mayor brought him and some other kids into Imaginationland just before the terrorist attack.
"
11,11,Perseus,"So YOU came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists! That seems like quite a coincidence!
"
11,11,Butters,"I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
"
11,11,Perseus,"You caught the Leprechaun? Take him!
"
11,11,Snarf,"Perseus! He's not against us snarf snarf!
"
11,11,General,"Talk to me! What's going on?! 
"
11,11,Lead tech,"Something is... coming through the gate from the other side. 
"
11,11,Operator,"What is it?!
"
11,11,Tech 4,"Its like a... half man half bear!
"
11,11,Lead tech,"And half pig! 
"
11,11,Tech 5,"Oh! No, no wait! It's like a half bear half manpig! 
"
11,11,General,"Look out! 
"
11,11,Lead tech,"No! I think it's more like a half man, and half pigbear! 
"
11,11,General,"Reverse the doorway! Send it back through!
"
11,11,Kyle,"AAAHHH! 
"
11,11,Stan,"KYLE!! 
"
11,11,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAAA- 
"
11,11,Butters,"Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
"
11,11,Perseus,"That is for the Council of Nine to decide!
"
11,11,Lollipop King,"Don't worry, kid, the Council of Nine consists of some of the most highly-regarded imaginary characters in all Imaginationland
"
11,11,Aslan,"Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate.
"
11,11,Zeus,"Yes. Their power outmatches ours. If they are giving us a chance to leave we must take it!
"
11,11,Aslan,"And what say you, Morpheus?
"
11,11,Morpheus,"How our we to know that they will let us go? Their offer could be a trap.
"
11,11,Glinda,"Perhaps we must flee to the Temple of Alderon. Surely they wouldn't chase us there.
"
11,11,Jesus,"No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be.
"
11,11,Luke Skywalker,"I'm with Jesus. The evil characters aren't going to just us go.  That may be, Popeye, but we don't have a choice! 
"
11,11,Perseus,"Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but this boy has infiltrated from the real world.
"
11,11,Aslan,"Bring him here!
"
11,11,Paramedic,"Clear!  I'm sorry. He's gone.
"
11,11,Cartman,"No! Kyle can't die. 
"
11,11,Paramedic,"I'm sorry, young man.
"
11,11,Cartman,"Kyle?
"
11,11,Paramedic,"Well... at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls.
"
11,11,Cartman,"NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!
"
11,11,General,"He's gone, little boy.
"
11,11,Cartman,"Zap him again!  Do it!
"
11,11,Paramedic,"Charging.
"
11,11,Cartman,"DO IT!  Come on buddy.
"
11,11,Paramedic,"Clear.
"
11,11,Cartman,"Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. 
"
11,11,Aslan,"I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.
"
11,11,Zeus,"What are you saying, Aslan? That if we are to take back control, we might-?
"
11,11,Morpheus,"Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key.
"
11,11,Butters,"Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
"
11,11,Luke Skywalker,"If you ever wanna see your home again, little boy, you'll have to rise to this challenge.
"
11,11,Butters,"But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
"
11,11,Aslan,"It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right.
"
11,11,Tom,"Sir? Are you sure about this?
"
11,11,General,"We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option.  We have to nuke our imagination. 
"
11,11,Cartman,"Wake up, Kyle. 
"
11,12,Aslan,"Imaginationland... used to be a happy place. But then the terrorists attacked.  And so many of us were killed.  The Barrier came down, and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed.  Now our final battle will take place. The evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out. 
"
11,12,Beavery Beaver,"This is gonna be fun, huh? 
"
11,12,Aslan,"We prepare for a battle we cannot win.  Sweet and cuddly imaginary characters, many who have never held a weapon,  must now fight for their very lives. We are too few in number,  but we have one hope. That is where you come in, young boy.  Only you can help us win this battle.
"
11,12,Butters,"Wuh, what can I do?
"
11,12,Aslan,"You have a power here that you have yet to understand.
"
11,12,Al Gore,"Back it up!  Look!  Right there!  See that?!  What does that look like to you?! It's ManBearPig!  I told you it was real!  Look again!  There! half man, half bear, and half pig! Do you see it?!
"
11,12,Official 1,"Yes, we see it, Mr. Gore.
"
11,12,Al Gore,"Something big is going on, and the American people need to know what! I'm off! 
"
11,12,Doctor,"He's recovering, but there's been some trauma to his brain. The boy says he's been hearing imaginary voices.
"
11,12,Stan,"Hello?  Hello? Anybody? 
"
11,12,Kyle,"Stan? 
"
11,12,Stan,"Hello?
"
11,12,Kyle,"Stan?
"
11,12,Cartman,"Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?
"
11,12,Kyle,"Cartman, what's happened?
"
11,12,Cartman,"What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
"
11,12,Kyle,"No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
"
11,12,Cartman,"You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see
"
11,12,Kyle,"Arh!
"
11,12,Cartman,"Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!
"
11,12,Kyle,"Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
"
11,12,Cartman,"Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
"
11,12,Kyle,"Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
"
11,12,Cartman,"Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. 
"
11,12,Jesus,"Aslan, the evil characters are almost here!
"
11,12,Aslan,"Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!
"
11,12,Butters,"What powers? Ah I don't understand.
"
11,12,Gandalf,"You are real. You are a creator. That means you can imagine things into existence here.
"
11,12,Butters,"I c-I can?
"
11,12,Aslan,"Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.
"
11,12,Butters,"How?
"
11,12,Glinda,"You just have to focus your mind. Imagine Santa and nothing else.
"
11,12,Butters,"How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
"
11,12,Luke Skywalker,"Think only of one thing. Imagine it. Believe in it.
"
11,12,Gandalf,"Whatever is most prominent in your mind will come to be. 
"
11,12,Steven,"Butters!  You are grounded, mister! You hear me?!  Grounded!
"
11,12,Butters,"AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no! 
"
11,12,Aslan,"What are you doing?! We need Santa!
"
11,12,Butters,"I'm trying!
"
11,12,Wonder Woman,"Come on, kid, imagine Santa! Believe in Santa!
"
11,12,Zeus,"You must believe in Santa!
"
11,12,Aslan,"BELIEVE IN SANTA! RIGHT NOW!
"
11,12,Butters,"GAA HAA!
"
11,12,Cartman,"Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
"
11,12,Kyle,"Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
"
11,12,Anchorman,"A new terrorist attack seems to have taken place. This time, in our imagination.  Al Gore brought this video to the public's attention, sparking demands by everyone who wants to know exactly what's going on.
"
11,12,General,"We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild.
"
11,12,Reporter 1,"Our imaginations are running wild and we weren't told?!
"
11,12,General,"By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination.
"
11,12,Reporter 2,"Is nuking our imagination really prudent?
"
11,12,Reporter 3,"Aren't there other, more peaceful ways to get our imagination under control?
"
11,12,Reporter 4,"Couldn't we trying sending Kurt Russell into a portal to our imagination to try and reason with the-
"
11,12,General,"We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters!
"
11,12,Reporter 5,"...A-ooch
"
11,12,Anchorman,"The Pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real, the military doesn't need Senate approval to nuke them.
"
11,12,Hippie 1,"That's bullcrap, man! You can't nuke our imagination!
"
11,12,Hippie 2,"Don't nuke our imagination bro! WOOO!
"
11,12,Anchorman,"Mike, does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination?
"
11,12,Mike,"Uh clearly they don't, Steven, and they're gonna have a big problem because state government has already set a precedent that imaginary characters are real. I cite a famous case of Cartman v. Broflovski in which a U.S. court found for the plaintiff who saw a leprechaun.
"
11,12,Anchorman,"Yes, I believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiff's balls in that case.
"
11,12,Mike,"That's right, Steven, yeah.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Oh for the love of God!
"
11,12,Stan,"Hello? Can anybody hear me?
"
11,12,Kyle,"Stan! Dude, is that you?
"
11,12,Stan,"Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
"
11,12,Kyle,"No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
"
11,12,Stan,"...Oh that makes sense.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Dude, what's happening?
"
11,12,Stan,"I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
"
11,12,Lollipop King,"The evil characters are here. 
"
11,12,Jesus,"There are so many of them. HAAAAA! 
"
11,12,Aslan,"There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW!
"
11,12,Butters,"Santa. Saaanta.
"
11,12,Luke Skywalker,"Think. Jolly old Santa. Red suit, white beard.
"
11,12,Butters,"Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta! 
"
11,12,Cartman,"How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
"
11,12,Anchorman,"A shocking new development in the nuking of imagination!
"
11,12,Chief Justice,"The Supreme Court has ruled with the military that imaginary things are officially not real, and therefore no approval is needed to nuke them.
"
11,12,General,"Thank you.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Oh no.
"
11,12,Chief Justice,"This of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past, including the famous Cartman v. Broflovski ballsucking case.
"
11,12,Cartman,"...What?
"
11,12,Steven,"So it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation, one they are calling ""Operation Nuke the Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway.""
"
11,12,Stan,"Kyle? What's happening?
"
11,12,Kyle,"The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
"
11,12,Stan,"What?! You can't let them do that!
"
11,12,Kyle,"What am I supposed to do?
"
11,12,Stan,"Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
"
11,12,Kyle,"Stan? Stan?? 
"
11,12,Cartman,"Where are you going?!
"
11,12,Kyle,"I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
"
11,12,Cartman,"Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
"
11,12,Kyle,"No, I don't! The decision was overturned. 
"
11,12,Cartman,"We had a DEAL KYLE!
"
11,12,Kyle,"Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
"
11,12,Cartman,"IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!
"
11,12,Morpheus,"I need more spinach for Popeye! 
"
11,12,Tron Soldier,"I-ee got one. I got him. 
"
11,12,Beary Bear,"Hey there. 
"
11,12,Icarus,"We're losing the battle! There are simply too many of them!
"
11,12,Aslan,"Then the day is lost.
"
11,12,Wonder Woman,"Wait! Aslan, look! 
"
11,12,Santa,"What? What happened?
"
11,12,Luke Skywalker,"You did it, kid!
"
11,12,Aslan,"Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield!
"
11,12,Santa,"Huh?  Oh, all right.  Make way for Santa! 
"
11,12,Aslan,"Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day!
"
11,12,Guard 2,"This area is restricted, little boy.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
"
11,12,Guard 2,"Get behind the line with the other protesters! 
"
11,12,Hippie 3,"No nukes in our imagination, bro! Wooo! 
"
11,12,Kyle,"Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
"
11,12,Guard 2,"You pot-smokin' hippies aren't gettin' through here, so back off!
"
11,12,Hippie 4,"Stop that nuke!
"
11,12,Hippies,"Stop that nuke!
"
11,12,Hippies and Kyle,"Stop that nuke! 
"
11,12,Al Gore,"What's going on here?  The military has to do this! It's their only way to kill ManBearPig. 
"
11,12,Aslan,"Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!
"
11,12,Butters,"Huwhoa! 
"
11,12,Perseus,"Aslan! We're losing the battle!
"
11,12,Robin Hood,"We managed to fight off the vampires and werewolves, but... now our troops are being shot down by the Cavity Creeps.
"
11,12,Aslan,"Cavity Creeps?
"
11,12,Cavity Creeps,"We make holes in teeth! We make holes in teeth!
"
11,12,Wonder Woman,"What can destroy the Cavity Creeps?
"
11,12,Perseus,"Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control.
"
11,12,Aslan,"Quickly! You must imagine a giant Crest Gel! 
"
11,12,Robin Hood,"Yes!
"
11,12,Gandalf,"His powers are getting stronger. We might just have a chance here.
"
11,12,Archangel,"Aslan, we've captured a spy! He was sneaking around the Gumdrop Forest! 
"
11,12,Butters,"Stan!  Hey look, I imagined Stan here!
"
11,12,Stan,"No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
"
11,12,Aslan,"Project Imagination Doorway? 
"
11,12,Gandalf,"Never mind! The battle is almost won! We can deal with him later.
"
11,12,Stan,"No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.
"
11,12,Luke Skywalker,"What?
"
11,12,Butters,"Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?
"
11,12,Stan,"So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
"
11,12,Aslan,"We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!
"
11,12,Stan,"The Chosen One?
"
11,12,Butters,"Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.
"
11,12,Computer,"Missile launch sequence initiated.
"
11,12,General,"All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books.
"
11,12,Tech 1,"Sir, we have a security breach!
"
11,12,General,"What?!
"
11,12,Tech 3,"There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
"
11,12,General,"Sector 2? 
"
11,12,Cartman,"What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
"
11,12,General,"What?
"
11,12,Cartman,"You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
"
11,12,Lab Tech,"Imaginary things are things made up by people, like Santa and Rudolph.
"
11,12,Tom,"Yeah, and they detract from real things, like Jesus.
"
11,12,Tech 1,"Maybe Jesus is imaginary too.
"
11,12,Tom,"Ooooh, you'd better not say that! You'll go to hell!
"
11,12,Tech 7,"It's possible that hell is also imaginary.
"
11,12,Tech 2,"Uh so then, we're about to nuke hell... that's a good thing, right?
"
11,12,Personnel,"Hell yeah, that's a good thing, yeah.
"
11,12,Lab Tech,"What if heaven is imaginary? We'd be nuking heaven.
"
11,12,Tech 3,"Yeah, but it wouldn't be real.
"
11,12,Lab Tech 2,"So it'd be all right.
"
11,12,Cartman,"Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
"
11,12,Tom,"Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary, but Jesus and hell are real!
"
11,12,Tech 3,"Well then, what about Buddha?
"
11,12,Tom,"Well of course he's imaginary!
"
11,12,Lab Tech 3,"Awww, see? Now you're being intolerant, Tom.
"
11,12,Tech 7,"Am I real?
"
11,12,General,"All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!
"
11,12,Cartman,"No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!
"
11,12,Stan,"Kyle? Kyle, what happened?
"
11,12,Kyle,"Nothing.
"
11,12,Stan,"What??
"
11,12,Kyle,"Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! 
"
11,12,Stan,"Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
"
11,12,Kyle,"They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
"
11,12,Stan,"Well you have to convince them they are real!
"
11,12,Kyle,"No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
"
11,12,Stan,"Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Huh? 
"
11,12,Jesus,"Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Oh boy...
"
11,12,Jesus,"What seems to be the problem, my child?
"
11,12,Kyle,"Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?
"
11,12,Luke Skywalker,"No eh, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Aah.
"
11,12,Luke Skywalker,"Look, I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you remember when I brought down the Death Star. I m, I mean, that seemed impossible too, right?
"
11,12,Kyle,"Yeah, I guess.
"
11,12,Luke Skywalker,"Uh okay, now, now hold on, because Superman is here and he wants to say something. 
"
11,12,Superman,"Kyle, this is Superman.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Hi Superman.
"
11,12,Superman,"I know that saving people can be a big responsibility, but no matter what it takes, it's worth it.
"
11,12,Kyle,"I know.
"
11,12,Superman,"You can do this, Kyle. How hang on, because Hercules wants to talk to you.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Oh God...
"
11,12,Superman,"Yes, God is here too. He's gonna talk to you right after Captain Crunch.
"
11,12,Jesus,"Popeye, I need some help here! 
"
11,12,Lollipop King,"Popeye is being killed by Christmas Critters. 
"
11,12,Popeye,"Gaw guguh, getskug off of me!
"
11,12,Beary Bear,"Hey, what is that?
"
11,12,Butters,"More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
"
11,12,Jesus,"All right!
"
11,12,Aslan,"The boy is doing it! Everything is going to be okay!
"
11,12,Computer,"Missile launch in one minute.
"
11,12,Cartman,"Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
"
11,12,General,"Prepare for launch...
"
11,12,Tech 1,"Sir, we have a security breach!
"
11,12,General,"What?!
"
11,12,Tech 3,"There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
"
11,12,General,"Sector 2? 
"
11,12,Cartman,"Kyle?
"
11,12,General,"The hell are you doing back here?!
"
11,12,Kyle,"Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
"
11,12,General,"Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!
"
11,12,Kyle,"You have to stop!
"
11,12,General,"If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?
"
11,12,Kyle,"Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of ""real."" They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 
"
11,12,General,"Abort the sequence. 
"
11,12,Cartman,"So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 
"
11,12,Kyle,"Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!
"
11,12,Al Gore,"What happened?! Why hasn't the missile gone off?!
"
11,12,General,"There's been an abort, Mr. Gore.
"
11,12,Al Gore,"No! ManBearPig has to die! 
"
11,12,Tech 3,"Oh Jesus no! 
"
11,12,Lollipop King,"That's it, Aslan! The evil characters have fled!
"
11,12,Aslan,"The day is ours! 
"
11,12,Stan,"Kyle!
"
11,12,Butters,"Fellas! Where'd you come from? 
"
11,12,Zeus,"What is that? 
"
11,12,Butters,"Huh... 
"
11,12,Jesus,"He did it!
"
11,12,Fanciful Mayor,"Oh look, I'm back!
"
11,12,Luke Skywalker,"Nice going, kid. 
"
11,12,Fanciful Mayor,"The evil characters! They're all behind the wall again.
"
11,12,Stan,"Dude! How did you do that, Butters?
"
11,12,Butters,"Well I just... used my imagination.
"
11,12,All,"Awwww 
"
11,12,Cartman,"You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 
"
11,12,Kyle,"Cartman, don't!
"
11,12,Cartman,"O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 
"
11,12,Stan,"Dude.
"
11,12,Lollipop King,"Oh my God.
"
11,12,Cartman,"O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
"
11,12,Kyle,"I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
"
11,12,Cartman,"No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
"
11,12,General,"That's true. You did.
"
11,12,Cartman,"Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. 
"
11,12,Santa,"Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.
"
11,12,Kyle,"I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
"
11,12,Fanciful Mayor,"Whatever you imagine to be real, is real. 
"
11,12,Steven,"Butters?  Butters!
"
11,12,Butters,"A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
"
11,12,Steven,"Come on, Butters, time to get up. 
"
11,12,Butters,"Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
"
11,12,Steven,"You WERE in Imaginationland, Butters! We've read all about it in the paper! The question is, what were you doing in Imaginationland when you were supposed to be helping your mother clean up the basement?!
"
11,12,Linda,"You are grounded, mister!
"
11,12,Butters,"Ohhh.  Wait, I'm not grounded.
"
11,12,Steven,"Oh yes you are!
"
11,12,Butters,"Oh yeah? 
"
11,12,Steven,"That only works in Imaginationland! You're grounded! 
"
11,12,Butters,"Ahhh shit.
"
11,13,Cartman,"Stan, you guys are good! 
"
11,13,Randy,"Sharon, what are the boys doing?
"
11,13,Sharon,"Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.
"
11,13,Randy,"They can play guitar now?
"
11,13,Sharon,"No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.
"
11,13,Randy,"Ohhh.
"
11,13,Sharon,"If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.
"
11,13,Randy,"Hey yeah...
"
11,13,Stan,"Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 
"
11,13,Randy,"So you boys like this music, huh?
"
11,13,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.
"
11,13,Butters,"Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
"
11,13,Randy,"Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. 
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-
"
11,13,Stan,"Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!
"
11,13,Randy,"I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
"
11,13,Cartman,"Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.
"
11,13,Randy,"But... But this is real.
"
11,13,Cartman,"Real guitars are for old people.
"
11,13,Craig,"Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. 
"
11,13,Stan,"Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 
"
11,13,M.C.,"Are you ready to rock? 
"
11,13,Kansas,"""Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more""
"
11,13,M.C.,"Game over! You suck! 
"
11,13,Butters,"They're gonna do it!
"
11,13,Cartman,"Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!
"
11,13,Kyle,"Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. 
"
11,13,M.C,"You have broken a hundred thousand points! You. Are. Rock stars!
"
11,13,Stan,"Dude, we are total rock stars now!
"
11,13,Randy,"You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! 
"
11,13,Stan,"Hang on.
"
11,13,Man,"Stan Marsh?
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah?
"
11,13,Man,"I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah, we did. 
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"I'm impressed.  And I'd like to be your manager.
"
11,13,Stan,"Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!
"
11,13,Randy,"No way!
"
11,13,Kyle,"For reals? 
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points.
"
11,13,Stan,"That'd be awesome!
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"So, we're in business then? 
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Well, what do you think?
"
11,13,Producer,"I like it. That's these boys playing?
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"No, that's Kansas. But these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode.
"
11,13,Producer,"That's pretty Goddamned impressive.  Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. 
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Yes! You did it, boys.
"
11,13,Producer,"Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?
"
11,13,"Stan, Kyle","Cool! 
"
11,13,Stan,"Wow, this is a huge party.
"
11,13,Producer,"Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.
"
11,13,Stan,"Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 
"
11,13,Kyle,"Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 
"
11,13,Producer,"Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.  Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house.
"
11,13,Stan,"Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
"
11,13,Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
11,13,Producer,"Would you boys like to meet him?
"
11,13,Stan,"Are you serious??
"
11,13,Producer,"Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
"
11,13,Jay,"Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys.
"
11,13,Stan,"Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.
"
11,13,Jay,"Thanks...
"
11,13,Guest,"Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere?
"
11,13,Producer,"You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
"
11,13,Kyle,"Do we? He's a legend!
"
11,13,Producer,"You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.
"
11,13,Tom Shane,"That, would be impressive.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
"
11,13,M.C.,"You Rock!
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"All right, nice rehearsal, boys.
"
11,13,Kyle,"D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it. 
"
11,13,Kyle,"Oh, okay. Cool. 
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"You've got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million.
"
11,13,Stan,"Really? That'd be sweet.
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"I think you could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he's holding you back.
"
11,13,Stan,"What, you mean, Kyle?
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Look, you score a lot higher than him; there's no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score.
"
11,13,Stan,"But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Very honorable. But you know where loyalty gets you in a game like Guitar Hero? Nowheres. Just listen to that video crowd.  I haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You've got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings.
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen. Except for you, of course.  Ah, Thad!  Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis.
"
11,13,Thad,"Sup? 
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad? 
"
11,13,Thad,"Yup.
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do.  Check this out.  Pretty damn good, huh?
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play ""John the Fisherman""? 
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history.
"
11,13,Male Diner,"Ohoh, I love this song. 
"
11,13,Butters,"Wow wee, look at him go!
"
11,13,Kyle,"Hey dude, how'd it-? 
"
11,13,Stan,"...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.
"
11,13,Butters,"Uh ohhh.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Who is this?
"
11,13,Stan,"This is um, Thad Jarvis.
"
11,13,Thad,"Sup?
"
11,13,Kyle,"Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?
"
11,13,Stan,"Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
"
11,13,Kyle,"But it's our game. We bought it together.
"
11,13,Stan,"I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
"
11,13,Stan,"Don't put this all on me, Kyle!
"
11,13,Cartman,"Oh my God this is so awesome.
"
11,13,Stan,"You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
"
11,13,Kyle,"I have been sick!
"
11,13,Stan,"Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
"
11,13,Kyle,"I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 
"
11,13,Craig,"Dude, this game rules.
"
11,13,Stan,"Let's just do this, all right? 
"
11,13,Brett,"Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it?
"
11,13,Stan,"It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.
"
11,13,Brett,"Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress.
"
11,13,Stan,"Huh?
"
11,13,Brett,"Have you ever heard of...  Heroin Hero?
"
11,13,Stan,"Hero-Heroin Hero?
"
11,13,Brett,"Ihit's a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You could call it the ultimate first-person shooter.
"
11,13,Stan,"And there's no score? No crowds?
"
11,13,Brett,"No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don't ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it.
"
11,13,The Dragon,"Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on.
"
11,13,Stan,"Dude, this is awesome.
"
11,13,Producer,"How are they coming?
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days
"
11,13,Mr. Hart,"They'd better be. I paid good money to rent this place out. 
"
11,13,Stan,"Ugh. Damint.
"
11,13,Thad,"Dude, sup. Did you practice last night?
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play.
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
"
11,13,Thad,"No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?
"
11,13,Stan,"We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
"
11,13,Thad,"Yeah? Well how about this one? I quite.  I quit I quit I quit.  I quit I quit I quit. I quit. I quit I quit.
"
11,13,Stan,"You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Stan, what is the matter with you?
"
11,13,Stan,"I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! 
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"What is this?
"
11,13,Stan,"Man...
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Are you playing Heroin Hero?
"
11,13,Stan,"Just, just a little.
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"No!  Nobody plays Heroin Hero just a little! You know, you never catch the dragon!
"
11,13,Stan,"I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"You'd better pull your act together, because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!
"
11,13,Stan,"No problem.
"
11,13,Older Boy,"Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!
"
11,13,Kyle,"I'm not done yet.
"
11,13,Younger Boy,"Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system?
"
11,13,Kyle,"No. You're thinking of somebody else.
"
11,13,Younger Boy,"Yeah, sure. He's the kid that scored a hundred thousand points.
"
11,13,Older Boy,"How come you're playing here now?
"
11,13,Kyle,"Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?
"
11,13,Mick,"You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
"
11,13,Mick,"Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little and... maybe you can play it for free.
"
11,13,Kyle,"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
"
11,13,Mick,"Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Thanks, Mick.
"
11,13,The Dragon,"Catch me. Come on, catch me.  What's wrong? Follow me. Come on. 
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Marsh? Stan, you got-  Oh my God!  Get up, Stan! Wake up!
"
11,13,Stan,"Huh? What, uh?
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!
"
11,13,Stan,"The dragon. Where did it go?
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"You've gotta pull it together!  Pull it together, Goddammit!
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Thank you for coming to Gamecraft Arcade to watch Stan Marsh break a million points and unlock superstardom. 
"
11,13,Token,"Go Stan!
"
11,13,Cartman,"All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
"
11,13,Token,"Yeah, Stan!
"
11,13,Craig,"Dude, what's the matter with him?
"
11,13,Butters,"He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"Goddamnit, he's a mess! 
"
11,13,Craig,"Oh man, I can't watch this.
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo! 
"
11,13,Cartman,"Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 
"
11,13,Mr. Hart,"The next time you bring me some talent, make sure they're talent-ed. 
"
11,13,Mr. Kincade,"You blew it! You had it all and you blew it! Listen to that video crowd! They hate you! 
"
11,13,Brett,"There he is! So, did you break a million yet?
"
11,13,Stan,"No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
"
11,13,Brett,"Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top.
"
11,13,Stan,"I just wanna find something else to play.
"
11,13,Brett,"Have you played...  Rehab Hero? You get chased by a big dragon, but you keep running away from it.
"
11,13,Stan,"I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?
"
11,13,Brett,"Sssure kid. Sure. 
"
11,13,Radio Host,"All right, that was the Splendifs. And now here's a hit you all remember. It's a song that two local fourth grade boys scored a hundred thousand points to on Guitar Hero.  Don't know whatever happened to those boys. I Guess... they're not playing the game anymore.
"
11,13,Skid Row,"""Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through""
"
11,13,Stan,"Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
"
11,13,Kyle,"What are you doing here? 
"
11,13,Stan,"Please, ih ih, it won't take long.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 
"
11,13,Stan,"I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 
"
11,13,Kyle,"Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 
"
11,13,Stan,"Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 
"
11,13,Stan,"That isn't it at all. 
"
11,13,Kyle,"You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 
"
11,13,Stan,"I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.
"
11,13,Kyle,"It was pretty fun, wasn't it?
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
"
11,13,Stan,"I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
"
11,13,Kyle,"I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
"
11,13,Stan,"What, you mean it?
"
11,13,Kyle,"I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
"
11,13,Stan,"Then let's go, dude! 
"
11,13,Kyle,"Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
"
11,13,Mick,"Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?
"
11,13,Kyle,"Thanks, Mick! 
"
11,13,Stan,"All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 
"
11,13,Randy,"Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh.
"
11,13,The Dragon,"Come on, come on. You almost got me. Catch me. Come on.
"
11,13,Stan,"Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!
"
11,13,Randy,"Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.
"
11,13,The Dragon,"Hehe, you almost caught me.
"
11,13,Stan,"No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
"
11,13,Randy,"I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
"
11,13,Stan,"You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! 
"
11,13,Randy,"NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
"
11,13,Stan,"Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
"
11,13,Cartman,"Stop cheating, Craig! 
"
11,13,Craig,"How was that cheating!
"
11,13,Cartman,"'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
"
11,13,Butters,"Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!
"
11,13,Cartman,"What?
"
11,13,Butters,"Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 
"
11,13,The Boys,"Oh, let's go! Cone on, let's go!
"
11,13,Butters,"They're gonna do it! 
"
11,13,Craig,"They did it!
"
11,13,Jimmy,"Oh my sweet J-Jesus!
"
11,13,M.C.,"You have played Guitar Hero enough to reach one million points! Congratulations! You. Are. FAGS. 
"
11,13,Stan,"That's it?
"
11,13,Kyle,"Goddammit! God dammit! 
"
11,13,Cartman,"Butters, you wanna play me next? 
"
11,13,Butters,"Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 
"
11,14,Butters,"Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!
"
11,14,Stan,"Dude, Butters, calm down.
"
11,14,Butters,"Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
"
11,14,Craig,"So who do they say is the cutest?
"
11,14,Butters,"I donno.
"
11,14,Token,"Who do they say is the ugliest?
"
11,14,Butters,"I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 
"
11,14,Cartman,"They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
"
11,14,Stan,"Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
"
11,14,Clyde,"If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.
"
11,14,Kyle,"You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
"
11,14,Cartman,"Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
"
11,14,Craig,"You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
"
11,14,Cartman,"Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
"
11,14,Craig,"You don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom?
"
11,14,Cartman,"No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor
"
11,14,Kenny,"(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)
"
11,14,Cartman,"Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
"
11,14,Butters,"You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
"
11,14,Kyle,"You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
"
11,14,Cartman,"All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
"
11,14,Bebe,"What??
"
11,14,Cartman,"You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
"
11,14,Bebe,"That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
"
11,14,Cartman,"Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.
"
11,14,Bebe,"I'm not...  telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! 
"
11,14,Cartman,"Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!
"
11,14,Butters,"Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
"
11,14,Cartman,"Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.
"
11,14,Cartman,"All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"" 
"
11,14,Butters,"Neato!
"
11,14,Cartman,"At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
"
11,14,Butters,"O-kay!
"
11,14,Cartman,"Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
"
11,14,Nelly,"Ow! What'dja do that for?!  Hey, what's your problem, asshole?! 
"
11,14,Cartman,"Bail, bail! 
"
11,14,Cartman,"Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
"
11,14,Butters,"They sure don't.
"
11,14,Cartman,"Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time."" When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
"
11,14,Butters,"You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
"
11,14,Cartman,"Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! 
"
11,14,Cartman,"We got it! We got it! 
"
11,14,Craig,"We got the list from the girls! 
"
11,14,Nelly,"Give that back you dirty buttholes! 
"
11,14,Cartman,"Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 
"
11,14,Clyde,"All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!
"
11,14,A Boy,"Hurry hurry!
"
11,14,Craig,"Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I?
"
11,14,Clyde,"What number am I on?
"
11,14,A Boy,"Is it set up?
"
11,14,Stan,"It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
"
11,14,Clyde,"Me?  I'm the cutest? 
"
11,14,Stan,"And then Token, and then me.
"
11,14,Token,"I'm number two? Wow.
"
11,14,Butters,"Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 
"
11,14,Craig,"Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso! 
"
11,14,Cartman,"What?! That's bullcrap! 
"
11,14,Kenny,"(Woohoo!) 
"
11,14,Kyle,"Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?
"
11,14,Cartman,"You're last, dude! 
"
11,14,Kyle,"No way.
"
11,14,Cartman,"Yes way! Check it out! 
"
11,14,Stan,"Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.
"
11,14,Cartman,"So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
"
11,14,Kyle,"I'm last? Last?
"
11,14,Stan,"Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?
"
11,14,Kyle,"I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
"
11,14,Stan,"Who cares what dumb girls think, right? 
"
11,14,Butters,"Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
"
11,14,Steven,"Well good for you, Butters.
"
11,14,Linda,"Way to go, champ.
"
11,14,Butters,"Whoopie! 
"
11,14,Steven,"Well, guess we don't have to ground him.
"
11,14,Sheila,"Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.
"
11,14,Kyle,"The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
"
11,14,Sheila,"Wwwhat? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
"
11,14,Kyle,"Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
"
11,14,Sheila,"You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. 
"
11,14,Kyle,"Oh God! I do?
"
11,14,Gerald,"But he has his mother's nose.
"
11,14,Kyle,"Ahahah!
"
11,14,Sheila,"Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.
"
11,14,Kyle,"Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
"
11,14,Sheila,"Kyle, come back here! 
"
11,14,Cartman,"I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!
"
11,14,Kyle,"Hrrgh! 
"
11,14,Cartman,"Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?
"
11,14,Martha,"Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed. 
"
11,14,Clyde,"Hey, what's goin' on?  What's goin on? Hey.  Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.
"
11,14,Clyde,"Hey, what's goin' on?
"
11,14,Two Girls,"Hey Clyde.
"
11,14,Clyde,"Hey.
"
11,14,Anne,"Hi Clyde.
"
11,14,Clyde,"What's goin' on? 
"
11,14,Butters,"Hey ugly! 
"
11,14,Clyde,"Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay?  You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too, but look what he accomplished.  Chin up, cowboy.  Hey, what's goin' on? 
"
11,14,Girl,"Oh, not much, just hanging around-
"
11,14,Butters,"Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 
"
11,14,Clyde,"Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks. 
"
11,14,Cartman,"Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. 
"
11,14,Blonde Boy,"Hey.
"
11,14,Kyle,"Hello. 
"
11,14,Bushy Eyebrows Boy,"Are you going to eat your pickle? 
"
11,14,Craig,"Could somebody toss the football back? Its over there next to the ugly kids. 
"
11,14,Big-Eared Boy,"I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry.
"
11,14,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
11,14,Big-Eared Boy,"Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground!
"
11,14,Kyle,"No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
"
11,14,Fat Girl,"We're not?
"
11,14,Kyle,"No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
"
11,14,Bushy Eyebrows Boy,"Hey yeah.
"
11,14,Kyle,"Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 
"
11,14,Lola,"I know, that song is so awesome. 
"
11,14,Stan,"Uh Wendy. Could I talk to you?
"
11,14,Wendy,"Of course, Stan. 
"
11,14,Stan,"Just for a minute. Over here. 
"
11,14,Lola,"You think he's gonna beg her to come back to him?
"
11,14,Wendy,"This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.
"
11,14,Stan,"Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
"
11,14,Wendy,"Which one? We make lists all the time.
"
11,14,Stan,"The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
"
11,14,Wendy,"Look, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-
"
11,14,Stan,"So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
"
11,14,Wendy,"Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's just not something we do flippantly! There's protocol!
"
11,14,Stan,"Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
"
11,14,Wendy,"All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.
"
11,14,Bebe,"Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.
"
11,14,Rebecca,"If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?
"
11,14,Bebe,"Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
"
11,14,Girls,"Sunshine.
"
11,14,Lola,"Deliberating ""Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse""? Millie has the floor.
"
11,14,Millie,"If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to submit that  Jennifer's purse is by far the cutest. Definitely cuter than Teresa's.
"
11,14,Blond Girl,"I don't think anyone here disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Teresa's, but it doesn't make it the cutest.
"
11,14,Bebe,"The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.
"
11,14,Lola,"Sunshine sparkle Wendy has the floor.
"
11,14,Wendy,"If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we...  That we reopen last week's list for debate.
"
11,14,Girls,"What'd she say? She's gotta be kidding!
"
11,14,Heidi,"Is she crazy?
"
11,14,Bebe,"All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing. 
"
11,14,Wendy,"Go ahead.
"
11,14,Stan,"Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
"
11,14,Rebecca,"You thought you should be number one?
"
11,14,Stan,"NO.
"
11,14,Bebe,"Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!
"
11,14,Wendy,"He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
"
11,14,Bebe,"I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
"
11,14,Girls,"Sunshine.
"
11,14,Kyle,"They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
"
11,14,A Voice,"Do not burn down the school, Kyle. 
"
11,14,Kyle,"Who said that?
"
11,14,A Voice,"I did.  Do you know who I am?
"
11,14,Kyle,"Abraham Lincoln?
"
11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"I am Abraham Lincoln. Burning down the school will not solve your problems. You think you've been cheated because you are ugly, but I am here to show you otherwise. Come! There is much to see.  I want you to look in here.  This woman is Nancy Pinkerton. As a child she was consistently the most beautiful girl in her entire school. Her life as a youth was filled with praises, and everything being handed to her. Boys told her she was special. She was funny. She was interesting. But that's only because she was hot. It wasn't until she reached age 40, when her looks started to fade, that she learned she was actually about as interesting and special, as a wet carrot.  This is the home of your new ugly friend, Yamal.  Because he's ugly, he gets nothing handed to him. He has to work at making something of himself. But that work is gonna pay off when he's an adult. He will have character, something that kids who are hot rarely develop. Like your classmate, Clyde.  Now that he knows he's good-looking, he doesn't have to make any effort to be special.
"
11,14,Clyde,"Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.
"
11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed.
"
11,14,Kyle,"But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
"
11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"You must be patient.
"
11,14,Kyle,"Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
"
11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"Very well.
"
11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you.
"
11,14,Kyle,"I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
"
11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"Well then you're just a fucking asshole! 
"
11,14,Wendy,"Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something!  Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle.
"
11,14,Stan,"I have no idea what you're talking about.
"
11,14,Wendy,"It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. 
"
11,14,Rebecca,"Oh, hey Wendy.
"
11,14,Wendy,"Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?
"
11,14,Rebecca,"Oho Wendy, we're done with that list.
"
11,14,Wendy,"I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-
"
11,14,Rebecca,"All right, you need to stop. Digging. Around, Wendy!  You might not like... what you find!  Just back off and stop asking questions!  You're getting close to a secret that I don't think you can handle! Let it... go! 
"
11,14,Stan,"That didn't sparkle with her, did it?
"
11,14,Clerk,"One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid,  seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches.  Okay, is that everything, little boy?
"
11,14,Kyle,"That should just about do it.
"
11,14,Jerry,"Do you like to put this on your True-Value card today?
"
11,14,Wendy,"Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.
"
11,14,Lola,"Why would she do that?
"
11,14,Wendy,"Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here.  We need to remake that list. 
"
11,14,Jenny,"You just couldn't let it go! 
"
11,14,Wendy,"Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.
"
11,14,Jenny,"I'm afraid we can't do that, Wendy! 
"
11,14,Lola,"Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's father own the shoe store at the mall? A lot of us have always wanted to date Clyde to get free shoes, but we couldn't, because he wasn't popular enough.
"
11,14,Wendy,"You knew!
"
11,14,Lola,"Unfortunately, the members voted Clyde in the bottom five of the list! That's why we had to manipulate the votes, forge a new list, and... hide the real one!
"
11,14,Wendy,"So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!
"
11,14,Jenny,"Bebe?! Who do you think authorized the buyout?!
"
11,14,Wendy,"No. Not Bebe.
"
11,14,Jenny,"She's dating Clyde now. Nobody loves shoes more than her.
"
11,14,Stan,"What's going on?
"
11,14,Wendy,"When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-
"
11,14,Jenny,"Do you really think they'll believe you over the heads of the committee?! We'll simple generate a new list! ""Biggest Liars""! And put you at the top!
"
11,14,Lola,"Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go! And keep your little mouth shut!
"
11,14,Wendy,"I don't think so! 
"
11,14,Lola,"AAGH!
"
11,14,Wendy,"Stan, run!
"
11,14,Stan,"Jesus, dude! 
"
11,14,Stan,"Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.
"
11,14,Yamal,"He's burning down the school.
"
11,14,Wendy,"What?
"
11,14,Yamal,"He said he gonna burn the school down to the ground.
"
11,14,Kyle,"All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
"
11,14,Stan,"Kyle! Kyle, don't!
"
11,14,Kyle,"Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
"
11,14,Stan,"The list was a forgery, Kyle!
"
11,14,Kyle,"Huh??
"
11,14,Stan,"It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 
"
11,14,A Girl,"That's about far enough!  Give me that list, Wendy!
"
11,14,Kyle,"Stan, what is going on?!
"
11,14,Stan,"It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.
"
11,14,Bebe,"Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!
"
11,14,Kyle,"So what number was I??
"
11,14,Wendy,"You've compromised everything! Our lists' integrity!
"
11,14,Bebe,"Did you seeee these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible!
"
11,14,Wendy,"It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, those are amazing.
"
11,14,Bebe,"Right?
"
11,14,Wendy,"Is that a lace across the top?
"
11,14,Bebe,"No, it's a little strap.
"
11,14,Stan,"Wendy!
"
11,14,Wendy,"Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!
"
11,14,Bebe,"If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away! 
"
11,14,Kyle,"She's gonna kill us?
"
11,14,Wendy,"It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.
"
11,14,Bebe,"Oh please, you're lying. 
"
11,14,Officer,"Give it up, Bebe. We know all about it. The list was compromised. Kyle Broflovski is not the ugliest boy in the class. 
"
11,14,Stan,"Wendy! 
"
11,14,Kenny,"(Aah-) 
"
11,14,Bebe,"Wait, I, I didn't do anything wrong.
"
11,14,Officer,"You can explain all that downtown. 
"
11,14,Stan,"Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. 
"
11,14,Stan,"Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
"
11,14,Kyle,"I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
"
11,14,Stan,"...Abe Lincoln?
"
11,14,Wendy,"Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way. 
"
11,14,Stan,"Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! 
"
