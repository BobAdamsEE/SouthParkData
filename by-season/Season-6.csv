6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Hello! City Wok! City Wok, I take your order prease!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Excuse me? Could we get through here?
"
6,1,Herbert Garrison,"Hell no! I've been savin' this spot for six hours! 
His name is Garrison, Mr. Garrison. He lost ten pounds takin' Jared's lead-
"
6,1,Randy,"Here he comes! 
"
6,1,Singer,"He's still lookin' good, with all those... sub sandwiches... 
"
6,1,Jared,"Thank you all so much. You know what? After a year of eating delicious sub sandwiches, I've proven weight loss is easy!  And I promise you, I will always be your faithful leader in easy weight loss!
"
6,1,Some men,"Alright! 
"
6,1,Cartman,"That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
"
6,1,Worker,"Mr. Vogle, some fans wanted to see if you'd sign their sandwich?
"
6,1,Jared,"Sure, let 'em in.  Hi kids. 
"
6,1,Butters,"Wow, Jared!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
"
6,1,Jared,"I sure did! And- Well- Well I, I also had a little help on the side.
"
6,1,Stan,"What kind of help?
"
6,1,Jared,"Well, eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it. But the way that I lost so much weight was that I got aides.
"
6,1,Cartman,"A- AIDS?
"
6,1,Jared,"That's right. I got aides about two years ago and I've been losing weight ever since. It's amazing how slim you can get with aides.
"
6,1,Stan,"I'll bet you can.
"
6,1,Jared,"Would you like to meet them?
"
6,1,Kyle,"Them?
"
6,1,Jared,"My aides. Scott! Tyler!  Scott is my personal trainer  and Tyler is my dietitian.
"
6,1,"Scott, Tyler","Hello.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Oh, ""A I D E S,"" aides.
"
6,1,Jared,"Yep. Hooray for aides!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
"
6,1,Jared,"I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides.
"
6,1,Kyle,"But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
"
6,1,Jared,"Y- you think so. Well, why... should it matter?
"
6,1,Kyle,"It matters, dude. 
"
6,1,Jared,"Hmmm.
"
6,1,Kyle,"That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
"
6,1,Stan,"Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh-my-god!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Tha- that's diarrhea.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.
"
6,1,Stan,"Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
"
6,1,Cartman,"That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.
"
6,1,Kyle,"That's a great idea!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
"
6,1,Butters,"Me?!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
"
6,1,Butters,"Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.
"
6,1,Cartman,"I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
"
6,1,Kyle,"But Butters isn't fat.
"
6,1,Cartman,"That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.
"
6,1,Stan,"He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
"
6,1,Butters,"But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
"
6,1,Butters,"You mean like Jared?
"
6,1,Kyle,"Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
"
6,1,Butters,"Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
"
6,1,Stan,"You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 
"
6,1,Cartman,"He used to be fat but not no more 
"
6,1,Kyle,"City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
"
6,1,Stan,"Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls
"
6,1,Cartman,"and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
"
6,1,Butters,"Wow.
"
6,1,Jared,"Christine, you know I love you very much, and I, I can't wait for the wedding.
"
6,1,Christine,"I love you too, Jared. You've changed my whole life.
Her name is Jonez, Christine Jonez
She lost forty pounds when she met Jared-
"
6,1,Jared,"Yeh, I know I know, I know. But uh... some young boys were talkin' to me earlier, and... it made me think that people might not be so proud of my weight loss if they knew something.
"
6,1,Christine,"Jared, what's this all about?
"
6,1,Jared,"Uh, Christine, this isn't probably gonna matter to you at all, but... I have aides.
"
6,1,Christine,"What?!
"
6,1,Jared,"Yeah, I have aides. I've had aides since before we were together.  What, what are you thinking? Are you bummed?
"
6,1,Christine,"Am I bummed?!  You've had AIDS all this time and you knew it?!
"
6,1,Jared,"Well of course I knew it.
"
6,1,Christine,"Why the hell wouldn't you tell me?!
"
6,1,Jared,"I didn't think it was that big of a deal.
"
6,1,Christine,"Not that big of a deal?! I slept with you!
"
6,1,Jared,"Aren't you overreacting a little bit?
"
6,1,Christine,"Well, Jesus Christ! We're supposed to get married!
"
6,1,Jared,"We can still get married Christine, I mean, sure, they're my aides now, but after we get married... they'll be our aides  You'll love having aides, Christine, you really will. And when we have children, they'll have aides. It'll make things so simple!  Christine!  Jeez, those boys were right. People really don't like aides. I'd better tell everyone the truth.
"
6,1,Chef,"Hello there, children.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.
"
6,1,Chef,"Fifty pounds? Why?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Uuuh, school project.
"
6,1,Chef,"Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him.
"
6,1,Stan,"Marry him?
"
6,1,Chef,"It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.
"
6,1,Butters,"Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.
"
6,1,Butters,"Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?
"
6,1,Chef,"Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. 
"
6,1,Butters,"Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.
"
6,1,Kyle,"You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. 
"
6,1,Stan,"Chef, we need more food.
"
6,1,Chef,"I'm runnin' out, children. 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!
"
6,1,Stan,"Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
"
6,1,Cartman,"So how long until we can joke about it?
"
6,1,Kyle,"Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Wugh, that's a long time to wait.
"
6,1,Butters,"Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Then eat your puke.
"
6,1,Butters,"No!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. 
"
6,1,Subway Representative,"Ladies and gentlemen, we at Subway are happy to inform you that Jared has elected to stay in South Park in order to speak to you once again! 
"
6,1,Man 1,"He's going to speak with us once again!
"
6,1,Subway Representative,"So, here he is, Jared! 
"
6,1,Singer,"He's still lookin' good, eatin' them sandwiches all the time... 
"
6,1,Jared,"Thank you-hoo, thank you all. Subway's is a healthy way to eat fast food and lose weight!
"
6,1,Subway Representative,"All right! 
"
6,1,Jared,"But,  I feel like I need to come a little clean about something, uh-... it wasn't just Subway sandwiches that made me thin.
"
6,1,Subway Representative,"...Huh?
"
6,1,Jared,"The reason I was able to lose so much weight so quickly was that I got aides. 
"
6,1,Man 2,"Huh?
"
6,1,Man 3,"What?
"
6,1,Man 4,"Did he say AIDS?
"
6,1,Jared,"But I still wanna be the leader in a fitter America, and so I'm here to tell you, that you should ALL go out and get aides! 
"
6,1,Man 2,"Oh my God!
"
6,1,A woman,"Is he serious?
"
6,1,Jared,"Having aides - is - awesome! With aides you can literally watch the fat melt away! And with the proper mix of aides and Subway sandwiches, anything is possible! 
"
6,1,Subway Representative,"Uh, the opinions expressed by Mr. Vogle are not necessarily those of the Subway Company. 
"
6,1,Kyle,"Wow! He looks great!
"
6,1,Stan,"How do you feel, Butters?
"
6,1,Butters,"W-well, k-kinda like Cartman.  Aw!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Get a hold of yourself, man!
"
6,1,Stan,"Alright, now it's time for phase 2.
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Welcome to Shitty Wok. You rike to try Shitty Chicken today?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"You want the Shitty Beef?
"
6,1,Kyle,"Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Which one? I see two fat friends.
"
6,1,Cartman,"The fat one!
"
6,1,Stan,"We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"...Why?
"
6,1,Kyle,"Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh! You mean like-a Jared?!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Just like Jared.
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"His name is Jared, he lose some weight. Shitty Wok food sure is great. Yeah, okay. That sound good. Saw if he lose weight eating Shitty Wok, I pay use to use him in commercial.
"
6,1,The Boys,"All right!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Sir, we are in business!
"
6,1,Subway Representative,"Jared, first of all we want to say that all of us here at Subway appreciate everything you've done for our company.
"
6,1,Jared,"Well, I appreciate your company doing everything it's done for me.
"
6,1,Subway Rep 2,"Yes, well, it is now the opinion of all of us that perhaps it would be best for you to take your... strange theories on weight loss elsewhere.
"
6,1,Jared,"...'Scuse me... am I being fired?
"
6,1,Subway Rep 3,"Jared, it's just that your new take on weight loss is contrary to our commitment to good health.
"
6,1,Jared,"How so?
"
6,1,Subway Representative,"Well, your new slogan, for instance.  ""When it comes to fitness, Subway goes hand in hand with aides.""
"
6,1,Jared,"Ah-hah. 
"
6,1,Singer,"His name is Jared. Jared lost weight eating Subway and... sandwiches of...
"
6,1,Cartman,"Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!
"
6,1,Butters,"Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
"
6,1,Butters,"Well alright then.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!
"
6,1,Jared,"I never asked to be famous; now everyone hates me! I almost wish I had never gotten aides! 
"
6,1,Tyler,"Hey now, come on. What kind of talk is that?
"
6,1,Jared,"I'm sorry, guys, but I...I think I wanna be aides-free for a while.
"
6,1,Scott,"Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you.
"
6,1,Tyler,"Yeah. Maybe they're all just jealous that they can't afford to hire their own aides.
"
6,1,Jared,"Wait a minute... you're right!  Yeah! I think I know how to be a celebrity again! 
"
6,1,Stan,"Did you bring the camera?
"
6,1,Kyle,"Yeah, we're all set.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Well, what do you mean?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.
"
6,1,Stan,"That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
"
6,1,Cartman,"I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Wow! 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.
"
6,1,Butters,"Hey fellas.
"
6,1,Stan,"Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Yeah, you're still fat!
"
6,1,Butters,"Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!
"
6,1,Butters,"Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
"
6,1,Cartman,"No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!
"
6,1,Stan,"Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
"
6,1,Butters,"Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...
"
6,1,Kyle,"Why are you doing this to us?!
"
6,1,Stan,"All prepared for liposuction surgery?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Check.
"
6,1,Butters,"Uh, I don't know about this, fellas.
"
6,1,Stan,"Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 
"
6,1,Kyle,"Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
"
6,1,Cartman,"That should blah  ah- here. 
"
6,1,Butters,"Woahhh!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Alrighty.
"
6,1,Butters,"Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Alright, I think it's in. 
"
6,1,Kyle,"The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Bohogh, egh. 
"
6,1,Butters,"Waaaahh!
"
6,1,Cartman,"There it goes.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Alright, it's working!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.
"
6,1,Butters,"Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.
"
6,1,Stan,"Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
"
6,1,Butters,"Everything's getting dark...
"
6,1,Stan,"We've gotta hurry this up. 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.
"
6,1,Stan,"He's losing weight. 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh, whoa. Whoa! 
"
6,1,Kyle,"It's out of control! 
"
6,1,Butters,"Whoa, everything's getting sparkly. 
"
6,1,Stan,"Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh, crap!
"
6,1,Stan,"Dude, bail! 
"
6,1,Linda,"Butters? Butters?!
"
6,1,Butters,"Mom. Dad.
"
6,1,Stephen,"Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth!
"
6,1,Butters,"Yes sir.
"
6,1,Linda,"This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!
"
6,1,Butters,"Four times, mom.
"
6,1,Stephen,"Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!
"
6,1,Butters,"Yes, sir. 
"
6,1,Stephen,"Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!
"
6,1,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing out in front of the Mayor's office, where the big liar, Jared, is once again about to speak. Apparently, Jared hopes to regain his celebrity hero status, which was lost when he announced that it was AIDS, not sub sandwiches, that caused him to lose weight. Let's listen in.
"
6,1,Jared,"Ladies and gentlemen, a-at first I didn't understand why you felt betrayed by the fact that my aides helped me to lose weight, but now I understand that it isn't fair that- I had aides and most of you don't. And so, with all the money I've made from commercials, I have decided to start the Aides for Everyone Foundation!
"
6,1,Jimbo,"What?!
"
6,1,Jared,"I am going to personally see to it that each and every one of you gets aides! 
"
6,1,Mayor McDaniels,"This guy's insane.
"
6,1,Jared,"But I won't stop there. I'm gonna seek out all the underprivileged and hungry children of the world, and I'm going to give them aides myself!
"
6,1,Chef,"You're gonna give children AIDS?!
"
6,1,Jared,"Yes, it is my hope that every beautiful child on this earth has aides by next month! Aides for everyone! 
"
6,1,Skeeter,"Get him! 
"
6,1,Stan,"Come on, Butters. Time to go.
"
6,1,Butters,"Uh- go where?
"
6,1,Kyle,"To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
"
6,1,Butters,"I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. 
"
6,1,Stan,"What?
"
6,1,Butters,"Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
"
6,1,Butters,"Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!
"
6,1,Stan,"...Kenny would have done it.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Yep.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.
"
6,1,Butters,"Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.
"
6,1,Butters,"No- but you don't sound like me.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Wow, that was pretty good.
"
6,1,Stan,"Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters. 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Eh.  Eh. Yeah.  Well hello?
"
6,1,Stephen,"I'm just checking in on you, Butters.  Heh- Do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.
"
6,1,Stephen,"Jacking it? Jacking what?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.
"
6,1,Stephen,"WHAT?! Are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.
"
6,1,Stephen,"OH YOU'RE GONNA GET IT MISTER! Just Wait until I get home!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Bring it on, queer bait.  Aaaahhhh, yes! 
"
6,1,Jared,"...I tell my  girlfriend I have aides and she leaves, I tell the  world to get aides and they think I'm crazy, I offer to give aides to kids and everyone wants me  dead!  What's wrong with  aides?! Why doesn't anyone want me to give them  aides?! 
"
6,1,Herbert Garrison,"There he is, beatin' that dead horse!
"
6,1,Man in Crowd,"Alright!
"
6,1,Jimbo,"Let's get him! 
"
6,1,Jared,"Aahhh!

6,1,Kyle,"Uh, why not?
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Don't you know? Everybody hate Jared. He want everyone in world to have AIDS. He sick in the head.
"

6,1,Phillip,"Here's a man's fart for ya. 
"
6,1,Terrance,"God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Hello?
"
6,1,Linda,"Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.
"
6,1,Linda,"Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.
"
6,1,Linda,"OH YOU JUST WAIT until I get home MISTER!
Cartman:
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank.  Eh. 
"
6,1,Terrance,"Ey! There's some anthrax over there! 
"
6,1,Phillip,"Oh no, hahahahahahaha.
"
6,1,Jared,"Why did I ever do those stupid commercials?
"
6,1,Mayor McDaniels,"Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do you have anything to say before you die?!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Wait!  You're all making a mistake!
"
6,1,Chef,"Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS!
"
6,1,Stan,"No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have ""AIDS,"" AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.
"
6,1,People in Crowd,"Oh.
"
6,1,Mayor McDaniels,"You mean, Jared's aides are like my aides?
"
6,1,Jared,"Yes. ...Y-you mean you all thought...? Oh my Gosh!
"
6,1,Skeeter,"Oh boy, do I feel stupid.
"
6,1,Gerald,"Oh we're so sorry, Jared
"
6,1,Jared,"No no, hey it was my fault. I can't believe I- I, I didn't think of what I was saying! 
"
6,1,Chef,"Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had! 
"
6,1,Randy,"Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever! 
"
6,1,Jared,"Oh my God! I told my girlfriend I wanted her to share my aides - oh, no wonder she left!
"
6,1,Herbert Garrison,"Cuh-can you imagine what we thought when you said, ""Aides for Everyone Foundation?""
"
6,1,Jared,"Oh, brother!
"
6,1,Skeeter,"Aha-  ...Hey. We're all laughing. 
"
6,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh hey, yeah. We, we woulda never laughed about this before.
"
6,1,Randy,"Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!
"
6,1,People in Crowd,"Ooo.
"
6,1,Mayor McDaniels,"He's right. It happened!
"
6,1,Jimbo,"Hey everybody! AIDS is finally funny!
"
6,1,People in Crowd,"Alright! Yay! Woohoo!  Hooray!
"
6,1,Mr. Mackey,"I knew it would be funny someday!  AIDS!
"
6,1,Herbert Garrison,"Then it's time... We can undo the banner! 
"
6,1,New Yorker,"Hooray!
"
6,1,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in the town square where just moments ago it was declared that AIDS... can finally be joked about. What a great day for humanity
"
6,1,Herbert Garrison,"""AIDS quilt"" 
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh boy, this is fantastic! I so grad AIDS is funny now.
"
6,1,Stan,"Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Sure 'kay. I pay you fifteen dowlars.
"
6,1,Stan,"Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Hey, I'm not a-Subway, I Shitty Wok. Shitty Wok don't have... million dollars.
"
6,1,Stan,"Oh God-damnit!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Aw, just forget the whole thing then!
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay.  Hey, you kids know why chicken cross the road?
"
6,1,Stan,"Why?
"
6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"'Cause it has AIDS.  AIDS so funny! 
"
6,1,Stan,"Well, so much for our money.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
"
6,1,Butters,"Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! 
"
6,1,Butters,"Huh. Huh, uh, uh.
"
6,1,Cartman,"There you are, Butters!
"
6,1,Butters,"Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
"
6,1,Cartman,"No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!
"
6,1,Butters,"Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?
"
6,1,Cartman,"No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!
"
6,1,Butters,"Hu-oh! Goody!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.
"
6,1,Butters,"Uh- perfect.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. 
"
6,1,Butters,"Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Butters, it was my pleasure. 
"
6,1,Butters,"Hi, Mom and Dad!
"
6,1,Stephen,"DON'T YOU HI MOM AND DAD US YOU LITTLE PUNK!!! ""(Punch)""
"
6,1,Butters,"Ow! Dad?
"
6,1,Linda,"YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TROUBLE YOU'RE IN MISTER! ""(Punch)""
"
6,1,Butters,"Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
"
6,1,Stephen,"YOU THINK YOU'RE TOUGH NOW?! ANSWER ME!!! 
"
6,1,Butters,"Aaaa!! 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.
"
6,2,Sharon,"Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda.
"
6,2,Sheila,"Yes, it was fabulous!
"
6,2,Linda,"Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!
"
6,2,Stephen,"Yeah. We figure that if our boys are goona be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too.
"
6,2,Linda,"Friends, by default. 
"
6,2,Randy,"Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.
"
6,2,Stephen,"Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!
"
6,2,Cartman,"Look you guys, Butters is asleep.
"
6,2,Stan,"He's such a douchebag
"
6,2,Cartman,"Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... 
"
6,2,Stan,"Yeah, and then what?
"
6,2,Cartman,"And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.
"
6,2,Kyle,"No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
"
6,2,Cartman,"Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh
"
6,2,Chris,"And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend.
"
6,2,Gerald,"A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that.
"
6,2,Chris,"No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation..
"
6,2,Randy,"They let you stay for free?
"
6,2,Chris,"Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!
"
6,2,Sheila,"Well that sounds like a good deal.
"
6,2,Randy,"Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
"
6,2,Sheila,"Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait! 
"
6,2,Stephen,"Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend!
"
6,2,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","All right! 
"
6,2,Butters,"Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies!  Oh, I'm all sticky. 
"
6,2,Stephen,"Here we are, everyone. 
"
6,2,Sheila,"Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!
"
6,2,Chris,"Where are Butters and Eric?
"
6,2,Stan,"They're still asleep.
"
6,2,Chris,"Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder! 
"
6,2,Phil,"Hello, folks, I'm Phil and this is Josh . We're with the Aspen Time-Share Company. 
"
6,2,The Parents,"Hello.
"
6,2,Josh,"You folks enjoying the condo?
"
6,2,Sheila,"It's lovely. Thank you.
"
6,2,Cartman,"You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!
"
6,2,Kyle,"What
"
6,2,Cartman,"So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
"
6,2,Stan,"What's a Hitler?
"
6,2,Cartman,"You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?
"
6,2,Stan,"No, I never have.
"
6,2,Cartman,"Shh-shh, here he comes.
"
6,2,Butters,"Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
"
6,2,Cartman,"Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!
"
6,2,Phil,"Well, we can't wait to show you what Aspen Time-Share is offering investors. Shall we do our thirty-minute meeting?
"
6,2,Randy,"Oh, do we have to do it right now?
"
6,2,Josh,"Well, best to do it and get it out of the way.
"
6,2,Chris,"Okay. 
"
6,2,Sheila,"Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill.
"
6,2,The Boys,"Okay.
"
6,2,Chris,"We'll meet you boys on the slopes. 
"
6,2,Butters,"Hey, do you guys smell that?
"
6,2,Stan,"Smell what?
"
6,2,Butters,"Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 
"
6,2,Cartman,"I don't smell anything. Do you guys? 
"
6,2,Butters,"Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
"
6,2,Cartman,"Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen. 
"
6,2,Thumper,"All right, little dudes,  great to see you out here. My name is Thumper, and I'm gonna be your cool ski instructor. 
"
6,2,Cartman,"His name is Thumper?
"
6,2,Thumper,"We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, make sure everybody has a goood time. 'Cause what is skiing about? Having a good...?  Time, that's right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you're gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time.
"
6,2,Butters,"So where's the part where we have a good time?
"
6,2,Thumper,"Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here. 
"
6,2,Butters,"Wuh, that's my face, sir.
"
6,2,Thumper,"Alright, we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together , in the shape of a slice of pizza. Then to go faster, we put 'em parallel, like... French fries.  You see that?  Pizza,  French fries,  Pizza,  French fries. 
"
6,2,Butters,"Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?
"
6,2,Thumper,"Okay, let's have the little dude at the end try first! What's your name?
"
6,2,Ike,"Iiiiike!
"
6,2,Thumper,"Okay, Mike, ski down to me! 
"
6,2,Kyle,"Go on, Ike.
"
6,2,Ike,"Pee-za, Fron fries. Pee-za, Fron fries. Fron friiiies.  Peeee-zaaa 
"
6,2,Thumper,"Okay, you see what he did?! He French-fried when he should've pizza'd. You French-fry when you pizza, you're gonna have a bad time!
"
6,2,Phil,"And so, we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in Phase 4.
"
6,2,Josh,"That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity!
"
6,2,Gerald,"I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.
"
6,2,Randy,"Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.
"
6,2,Phil,"Oh, I know, that's what everybody says - ""Not me, I can't afford it."" But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars!
"
6,2,Josh,"Wow!
"
6,2,Sheila,"For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?
"
6,2,Phil,"Well you see, ""time-share"" means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves  You  ""share"" the condo with other investors and pick the  ""time"" you want to stay.
"
6,2,Josh,"Share,  time.  Time share.
"
6,2,Randy,"So then it's not really ours.
"
6,2,Phil,"Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, ""I've got a little place in Aspen.""
"
6,2,Josh,"Try it. Try saying it. ""I've got a little place in Aspen.""
"
6,2,The Parents,"I've got a little place in Aspen.
"
6,2,Phil,"Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary ""I've got a nice little place in Aspen?"" Hahaha! Just kidding, wives.
"
6,2,Randy,"Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?
"
6,2,Phil,"Woll uh, you still gotta come to the time-share luncheon. We did give you a free condo for the weekend.
"
6,2,Gerald,"Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.
"
6,2,Phil,"Right, but this isn't that meeting. The luncheon is that meeting.  Don't worry, you're gonna have a great free meal at  the luncheon.
"
6,2,Kyle,"...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.
"
6,2,Cartman,"Ugh, no more., 
"
6,2,Tad,"Looks like you think you're a pretty good skier, huh, kid?
"
6,2,Stan,"Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
"
6,2,Tad,"I've been skiing for twenty-two years. Think you could beat me?
"
6,2,Stan,"Uhh... no.
"
6,2,Tad,"What's your name, hot shot? 
"
6,2,Stan,"Stan. Marsh.
"
6,2,Tad,"Stan Marsh  Stan DARSH is more like it.
"
6,2,Skier,"Haaaa, Darsh! 
"
6,2,Tad,"Alright, how about a race, then? You and me.
"
6,2,Stan,"Dude, I'm just learning.
"
6,2,Tad,"OooooOOOOooo!  Looks to me like you're not a ""hot shot"" after all.
"
6,2,Stan,"I never said I was.
"
6,2,Tad,"Oooooooo!
"
6,2,Tad's friends,"Oooooooo!
"
6,2,Tad,"You may think you've got what it takes, but as long as I'm around, you'll always be number two!  See ya later, Darsh! 
"
6,2,Phil,"And THAT is why owning a piece of an Aspen condo is not only possible,...
"
6,2,Josh,"It's downright smart!
"
6,2,Gerald,"Aha. 
"
6,2,Phil,"Op, here it is! As promised, a fabulous free lunch!
"
6,2,Gerald,"Wow, filet mignon' and lobster!
"
6,2,Sharon,"Not bad. 
"
6,2,Josh,"It's nice to feel rich, isn't it.
"
6,2,Sheila,"Oh, you know, this is really great.
"
6,2,Chris,"It sure it. 
"
6,2,"Randy, Gerald","What?
"
6,2,Randy,"Wait...
"
6,2,Phil,"You see? That's the great thing about time-share. You get a little taste of luxuries you can't afford.
"
6,2,Josh,"And then share it with the people who come tomorrow.
"
6,2,Randy,"All right, look, we've been here for over three hours
"
6,2,Gerald,"Yeah. Can we go now, please?
"
6,2,Phil,"Of course you can. Go hit those slopes!  If you could just please show me the backs of your table place cards real quick?  Oh my God! You got the red sticker!
"
6,2,Josh,"They got the red sticker?!
"
6,2,Phil,"They got the red sticker!
"
6,2,Stephen,"What's the red sticker?
"
6,2,Josh,"Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes.
"
6,2,Randy,"No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.
"
6,2,Phil,"Okay, okay, fine, I mean...  It would only take a second, but, I mean, you know, what did we do for you except, give you a free condo for the weekend. Huh. Seems like you could just... could just come up... and see what prize you had... 
"
6,2,Stephen,"O-all right!
"
6,2,Stan,"...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
"
6,2,Kyle,"...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.
"
6,2,Stan,"Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
"
6,2,Tad,"well well well, if it isn't Stan Darsh!
"
6,2,Stan,"Oh no.
"
6,2,Tad,"Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take Heather out for some fondue tonight, do ya?
"
6,2,Stan,"Heather? 
"
6,2,Heather,"Sorry, Stan, it's just that when it comes to skiing, Tad has all the right moves.
"
6,2,Tad,"I just might show her my moves tonight, if you know what I mean. 
"
6,2,Heather,"You aren't mad, are you, Stan? I mean, a girl's gotta look out for her best interests.
"
6,2,Stan,"...who are you people?!
"
6,2,Tad,"Still don't wanna race me? I told you he was chicken, Heather. Stan Marsh the Darsh! 
"
6,2,Stan,"All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
"
6,2,Tad and friends,"Oooooooo!
"
6,2,Tad,"Alright, fine. You and me at the summit, now!
"
6,2,Stan,"Okay.
"
6,2,Tad's friends,"Race! Race!
"
6,2,Announcer,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Aspen Mountain presents another ex-TREME racing showdown.  Seven-time World Aspen champion Tad Mikowski versus eight-year-old Stan Marsh!
"
6,2,Tad,"Hah! You're going down, little boy!
"
6,2,Stan,"Yeah, prob'ly
"
6,2,Butters,"Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh go Stan! 
"
6,2,Stan,"Fries... fries...
"
6,2,A skier,"He's got it! Tad's gonna win it! 
"
6,2,Tad,"Yeah! Yeeah! Yeah! You lose, Darsh!  Yeah! 
"
6,2,Butters,"U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.
"
6,2,Stan,"Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. 
"
6,2,Tad,"No hard feelings, right Darsh?!  Yeah!
"
6,2,Teen Girl,"Stan,  for what it's worth, I think you were really brave.
"
6,2,Stan,"Thanks. Who are you?
"
6,2,Teen Girl,"Hey, all the cool teens are gonna be at the youth center tonight for a dance. I hope you'll come because you're just so... we-hell, you're just so.. well, that's all. 
"
6,2,Gerald,"Finally, we get to go skiing!
"
6,2,Randy,"Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.
"
6,2,Gerald,"Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy.
"
6,2,Lift Operator,"Can I help you?
"
6,2,Stephen,"Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company?
"
6,2,Lift Operator,"Ooooh, go right on ahead, folks.
"
6,2,Sheila,"Thank you. 
"
6,2,Randy,"Well, this certainly is nice.
"
6,2,Gerald,"Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody.
"
6,2,Stephen,"Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo!
"
6,2,Linda,"Oh, Chris. 
"
6,2,Chris,"Hey look, this trailer goes right into a building. 
"
6,2,Phil,"Welcome back, folks!
"
6,2,Josh,"We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about!
"
6,2,Randy,"Oh, God-damnit!
"
6,2,Kyle,"Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
"
6,2,Teen Girl,"I'm glad you guys came. Do you like our youth center?
"
6,2,Stan,"I' seems fine.
"
6,2,Voguing Skier,"Yeah, too bad we're getting shut down. That hot-shot skier Tad's father is gonna bulldoze the building
"
6,2,Voguing Skier 2,"Where are all us kids supposed to go?
"
6,2,Stan,"Don't care. 
"
6,2,Kyle,"What do you wanna do now?
"
6,2,Stan,"I dunno.
"
6,2,Butters,"Let's dance. 
"
6,2,Cartman,"Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. 
"
6,2,Announcer,"Alright, Aspen-heh. As a special treat tonight we're proud to have the winner of today's race, Tad Mikowski. 
"
6,2,Tad,"Yeah!
"
6,2,Stan,"Oh,. God. 
"
6,2,Tad,"Hey everyone.  I'd like to sing a little song, if I may.
"
6,2,The Ladies,"Ooooooooo.
"
6,2,Stan,"Gah, let's go you guys. 
"
6,2,Tad,"This is a song I wrote about... Stan Marsh. Staaaaan... Daaaaarsh...Stan. Darsh. Darshy DaaarshStan DaaarshStan Darsh, Stan-darshStan Daaaaarsh DaaarshStan Darsh...
"
6,2,Stan,"Dude, what the hell is your problem?!
"
6,2,Tad and friends,"OooOOOOOOoooooo!
"
6,2,Stan,"I raced you, You won!
"
6,2,Tad,"A rematch? Oh, Darsh. You're even dumber than I thought.
"
6,2,Teen Boy,"He'll ski you anytime, anywhere
"
6,2,Teens,"Yeah!
"
6,2,Teen Girl,"But this time, if he wins, you get your dad to not close our youth center
"
6,2,Stan,"What?
"
6,2,Tad,"Alright then, let's make it interesting. Tomorrow afternoon. On the K-13. 
"
6,2,A Teen Boy,"The K-13? But that's the most dangerous run in all of America. 
"
6,2,Tad,"Hell, I'm not chicken! Are you, Darsh?! 
"
6,2,Stan,"I'll be there, you queen!
"
6,2,Tad,"Oh, yeah?!
"
6,2,Stan,"Yeah!
"
6,2,Tad,"Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought... Again! See ya tomorrow.
"
6,2,Butters,"Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?
"
6,2,Stan,"Dude, I have to!
"
6,2,Kyle,"Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.
"
6,2,Stan,"Dude, he's got Heather!
"
6,2,Kyle,"You don't even know Heather!
"
6,2,Stan,"I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
"
6,2,Mechanic,"The K-13? You don't wanna go down that run. That run has got a history. Thirty-five people have died goin' down it, and some say you can still see their ghosts up there. It was on that very ski run that a group of students were killed by a wolf-boy who escaped from a mental institution. You see, that ski run was once a burial ground to a tribe of vampire Wichicaw who ate the flesh of children with no eyes. Yah-, a lot of history on that ski run. 
"
6,2,Stan,"...Thank you.
"
6,2,Mechanic,"Yah. 
"
6,2,Kyle,"Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.
"
6,2,Stan,"This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
"
6,2,Phil,"...And so you see it's the investment opportunity that keeps on giving.
"
6,2,Gerald,"How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!
"
6,2,Josh,"And we certainly don't want to pressure you.
"
6,2,Gerald,"Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!
"
6,2,Phil,"Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want. Of course, that is, if you don't want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show.
"
6,2,Randy,"No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! 
"
6,2,Josh,"I know! Have you ever considered going in on a time share?
"
6,2,Phil,"That's only a couple thousand each, Josh!
"
6,2,Randy,"Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!
"
6,2,Gerald,"My God, can you believe those people?!
"
6,2,Stephen,"I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ...did... just say a thirty-minute presentation.
"
6,2,Randy,"Let's just get out of here. 
"
6,2,Phil,"Folks, I'm glad you're back, because we forgot to mention, time-share condos are still deeded properties!
"
6,2,Parents,"Aaagh!! 
"
6,2,Phil,"Oooo, you folks really lucked out this time. You're visitor number one thousand!
"
6,2,Josh,"That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!
"
6,2,Stan,"That does it! I'm calling the police! 
"
6,2,Stan,"Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
"
6,2,Thumper,"K-13?! But you're just a beginner! You ski outta your league, you're gonna have a bad time.
"
6,2,Stan,"I have to do this, okay? I have to!
"
6,2,Thumper,"Alright, well, if you gotta get good at somethin' really fast, there's only one way to do it. Come on!
"
6,2,Singer (and backup singers),"The day is approaching to give it your best
You've got to reach your prime!
That's when you need to put yourself to the test
And show us the passage of time
We're gonna need a montage (Montage)
A sports-training montage (Montage)
And just show a lot of things happenin' at once.
Remind everyone of what's goin' on. (What's goin' on?)
And with every shot, show a little improvement
To show it won't take too long
That's called a montage (Montage)
Even Rocky had a montage (Montage)
In any sport, if you want to go
From just a beginner to a pro
You'll need a montage (Montage)
a simple little montage (Montage)
Always fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage)
If you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed in a montage (Montage)
Montage (Montage)
"
6,2,Randy,"All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!
"
6,2,Phl,"That's not true, officers, we said they could leave at any time.
"
6,2,Thin Cop,"All right, let me see if I got this straight. You two gentlemen are offering part-time limited liability  ownership in one of your fabulous condos for the one-time price of eight thousand dollars?!
"
6,2,Phil,"That's right!
"
6,2,Fat Cop,"Sounds to me like if anybody should be arrested it should be you people for passin' up such a great deal!
"
6,2,Thin Cop,"That's right, you're practically stealing condos at that price. ""Book 'em, Danno!"" 
"
6,2,Randy,"Oh, Jesus.
"
6,2,Linda,"No! No!
"
6,2,Gerald,"The police work for time-share, too? 
"
6,2,Phil,"The police, the mayor, the president of the United States. Perhaps now you see the severity of your situation. I think we shall all sit down...  and listen to the presentation.
"
6,2,Josh,"Sit! 
"
6,2,Phil,"Now, you're probably asking yourselves... ""Can my time-share condo turn into a profit?""
"
6,2,Josh,"""What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?""
"
6,2,Phil,"The answer might astonish you. For over ten years investors have seen their-
"
6,2,Announcer,"The powder is fresh and the stage is set for Tad versus Stan on the K-13!
"
6,2,Tad,"This time you're not just gonna lose, you're gonna die!
"
6,2,Kyle,"I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. 
"
6,2,Announcer,"Ready. Set. Go! 
"
6,2,Stan,"Pizza... pizza... pizza...
"
6,2,Man In Yellow Jacket,"Tad's got the lead.
"
6,2,Butters,"Come on, Stan! 
"
6,2,Tad,"Haha.  This should slow down Darsh a bit! 
"
6,2,Announcer,"And it looks like Tad is way out in front.
"
6,2,Tad,"Now, I'll win for sure!
"
6,2,Kyle,"Awgh, dude, I can't look. 
"
6,2,Tad,"Let's see what some sand does to your speed, Darsh! He doesn't stand a chance, now! I'm gonna beat 'em! 
"
6,2,Announcer,"The race is half over and Tad is still out in the lead! 
"
6,2,Tad,"Heh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let all these hamsters go. That should distract him just long enough for me to win the race!
"
6,2,Teen girl,"Oh, Tad.
"
6,2,Tad,"...What are you doing up here?
"
6,2,Teen girl,"Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract you. With these. 
"
6,2,Kyle,"Good job, dude!
"
6,2,Stan,"Thanks. 
"
6,2,Announcer,"You did it, Stan! 
"
6,2,Teen girl,"Thanks a lot, Stan. Now we're gonna be able to keep the youth center. 
"
6,2,Mechanic,"Well, that does it. Looks like the spirits of the Wakichaw Indians can finally rest in peace. 
"
6,2,Heather,"Stan, I was wrong about you. Would you like to go out again? 
"
6,2,Teen girl,"Go ahead, Stan. She's everything you ever wanted. 
"
6,2,Sheila,"There you are, boys!
"
6,2,Kyle,"Mom, Dad!
"
6,2,Stan,"Where the hell have you guys been?!
"
6,2,Stephen,"Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office.
"
6,2,Randy,"Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!
"
6,2,The Boys,"Awwwwww!
"
6,2,Stephen,"What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing? 
"
6,2,Stan,"No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! 
"
6,2,Kyle,"Yeah, what a stupid sport! 
"
6,2,Thumper,"I heard that you were the one responsible for making Tad lose the race. Thanks.
"
6,2,Teen Girl,"Yeah. Well he really flipped when he saw these. 
"
6,2,Left Creature,"Quaid...
"
6,2,Right Creature,"Start the reactor...
"
6,3,Announcer,"Today on the Maury Povich show, these poor unfortunate people  all have horrible disfigurements,  and you won't believe how we exploit them for your amusement! 
"
6,3,Stan,"Hm, that sounds pretty good.
"
6,3,Stan,"Hey Kenny! 
"
6,3,Cartman,"That's awesome, Kenny. 
"
6,3,Butters,"Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
"
6,3,Kyle,"Okay, Not-Kenny.
"
6,3,Butters,"And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither!  I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!
"
6,3,Stan,"Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh, all right, then. 
"
6,3,Maury,"Our next guest is a little girl who was born without a midsection. Please welcome Damla Jones
"
6,3,Damla,"Hello, Maury. 
"
6,3,Cartman,"Aww, sick dude!
"
6,3,Maury,"You're a very brave little girl, and I'm very proud of you.
"
6,3,Damla,"Thank you
"
6,3,Maury,"Can you tell the audience how miseable your life is?
"
6,3,Damla,"Uh-uh, yes. It is.
"
6,3,Maury,"You're a cutey. Do the other kids at school sometimes make fun of you?
"
6,3,Damla,"Sometimes.
"
6,3,Maury,"Do people sometimes stare at you?
"
6,3,Damla,"Sometimes
"
6,3,Maury,"Do they go, ""Oh, gross. What the hell is that thing""?
"
6,3,Damla,"Mmm-I don't know. 
"
6,3,Maury,"Well your mommy told us you like to listen to music.
"
6,3,Damla,"Yes.
"
6,3,Maury,"Well guess what, Damla. We're gonna give you a three hundred dollar gift certificate to CD World in Torrance!  All right, everyone. Stay tuned, because next we're gonna meet a woman who head was smashed in on a locker! And we're gonna giver her a makeover!
"
6,3,Kyle,"This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
"
6,3,Announcer,"Do you or someone you know have a disfigurement or disability that we can exploit on the Maury Povish show? If so, call 1-555-HEY MAURY!
"
6,3,Stan,"Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
"
6,3,Kyle,"Cool!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Oh YES!! 
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh, that'd be awesome! 
"
6,3,Kyle,"Do you think they'll believe it?
"
6,3,Stan,"What disease should we say?
"
6,3,Cartman,"Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, well who the hell are you?  Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks?  Ye-right, people with disabilities?  Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great!  Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called ""chinballalitis.""  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.  Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it.  Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really?
"
6,3,Stan,"What? 
"
6,3,Cartman,"Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!
"
6,3,Kyle,"Awesome!
"
6,3,Butters,"Cool!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great. I'll call you back in an hour.  No, thank you.  YES!
"
6,3,Stan,"This is gonna be so funny!
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh, it sure is!
"
6,3,Kyle,"But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
"
6,3,Butters,"Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
"
6,3,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh, but that's me. I'm Butters.
"
6,3,Stan,"We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
"
6,3,Butters,"We-ell hold on a second, you guys.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.
"
6,3,Butters,"Hang on now.
"
6,3,Kyle,"Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
"
6,3,Butters,"Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
"
6,3,Stan,"It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
6,3,Butters,"But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
"
6,3,Kyle,"We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
"
6,3,Butters,"I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. 
"
6,3,Stan,"Kenny woulda done it. 
"
6,3,Butters,"...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.
"
6,3,Kyle,"We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.
"
6,3,Stan,"Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. 
"
6,3,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
6,3,Butters,"Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?
"
6,3,Brunet Trekker,"Now, we're going to apply the latex with some spirit gum.
"
6,3,Butters,"Hey that spirit gum sure is stinky.
"
6,3,Stan,"Where's you get the balls from?
"
6,3,Brunet Trekker,"We made a plastic mold of his chin, and then made a latex scrotum and put two golf balls inside.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Nice.
"
6,3,Blond Trekker,"Now we just blend the skin tones, add a little hair,  and presto! 
"
6,3,Stan,"Wow!
"
6,3,Kyle,"That looks awesome!
"
6,3,Butters,"Aw, I feel silly.
"
6,3,Cartman,"They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
"
6,3,Blond Trekker,"I believe you owe us payment now? 
"
6,3,Stan,"All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I
"
6,3,Brunet Trekker,"Wooww!
"
6,3,Blond Trekker,"They weren't lying!
"
6,3,Kyle,"Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. 
"
6,3,Blond Trekker,"Here, damnit!
"
6,3,Brunet Trekker,"Hey, hey! Stop it, man!
"
6,3,Announcer,"Gay Air Flight 243 with service to New York now ready for general boarding.
"
6,3,Stan,"That's your flight, Butters.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. 
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh wait.  You guys aren't comin' with me?
"
6,3,Stan,"Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
"
6,3,Butters,"Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
"
6,3,Cartman,"God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?
"
6,3,Kyle,"Yeah, he sure is.
"
6,3,Stan,"Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 
"
6,3,Cartman,"Buh-ters! Buh-ters!
"
6,3,Butters,"Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. 
"
6,3,Stagehand,"Thanks for coming on the show, kid. Maury is very excited to meet you. And this is the Green Room where you can hang out with the other guests until we call for you on set. Boy with Balls on Chin, meet Man with Foot on Head, Girl with Rapid Aging Disease, Disfigured Country Singer, and Man With No Face.
"
6,3,Butters,"Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
"
6,3,Man With No Face,"Yes, this is my sixth appearance. 
"
6,3,Stagehand,"I'll come back in a bit, folks. 
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Hey Roger!  What the hell is with these horrible veggie platters?!
"
6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Yeah, we told you last time we want fresher vegetables.
"
6,3,Roger,"I'm sorry, this is what the studio provides. Just take a seat on the couch, kid. I'll be back in a minute. 
"
6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"...Boy with balls on his chin. Haven't seen you around. How long have you been on the circuit?
"
6,3,Butters,"What circuit?
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"The talk-show circuit. Don't tell us this is your first one.
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?
"
6,3,Man With No Face,"Oprah two times, Jenny Jones once, Sally Jessie five times.
"
6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"You've only done Jenny once?
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Oh, ah I hate doing the Jenny Jones show. They don't even have their own hair people.
"
6,3,Man With No Limbs,"I'm doing Jenny tomorrow.
"
6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Yeah, you picked a good show to do first, kid, but you need to learn the ropes. There are a lot of people like you all over the country, and we all do talk shows for a living.
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"We all know each other and we kinda stick together to make sure our industry is protected
"
6,3,Man With No Face,"Yeah. Like when someone LIES about being a freak.
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh they, they do, huh?
"
6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Yeah, they'll make up a fake condition to go on these shows and then take our money away!
"
6,3,Man With No Limbs,"We don't take kindly to that.
"
6,3,Butters,"Well I can certainly see why.
"
6,3,Man With No Limbs,"It's okay. Folks don't do it anymore. Not after what they saw what we did to Lobster Boy.
"
6,3,Butters,"Lobster Boy?
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Yeah, loh-, Lobster Boy used to make appearances on all the talk shows. He was one of the most popular disfigured peoiple on TV.
"
6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"But then we all found out that Lobster Boy wasn't a real freak at all. He was just an actual lobster.
"
6,3,Man With No Limbs,"Lying sack of crap.
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"So you know what we did to him?
"
6,3,Butters,"What?
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"One night all us freaks got together, and we... boiled him alive. 
"
6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Now Lobster Boy is no more.
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"We're glad you agree.
"
6,3,Stagehand,"Okay, Boy with balls on his chin, you're up next.
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh, Jesus, see me through this.
"
6,3,Announcer,"Next on the Maury Povich show: we bring back some of our favorite disfigured people  and introduce you to some new ones
"
6,3,Stan,"Here he comes.
"
6,3,Kyle,"This is gonna be awesome!
"
6,3,Maury,"Our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Testicles and scrotum! 
"
6,3,Maury,"Please welcome eight-and-a-half-year old Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park Colorado.  Thanks so much for coming on our show.
"
6,3,Butters,"Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose.
"
6,3,Maury,"So, is it tough being ...different?
"
6,3,Butters,"Uhhh, yeah.
"
6,3,Maury,"And do all the kids at school make fun of you?
"
6,3,Butters,"They sure do. They always say to me, ""Butters, you're not Kenny."" But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
"
6,3,Cartman,"Uh oh, we're losin' him.
"
6,3,Butters,"I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.
"
6,3,Maury,"Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh what condition?
"
6,3,Maury,"You have balls that hang off your chin.
"
6,3,Butters,"I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.
"
6,3,"Stan, Kyle","Phew.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Oh, that was close.
"
6,3,Maury,"What names do they call you at school?
"
6,3,Butters,"Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, ""Hey, there goes Chinballs!"" 
"
6,3,Maury,"And do they call you ""freak"" and ""weirdo""?
"
6,3,Butters,"Well yeah, I s'psoe
"
6,3,Maury,"Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth?
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh, sure.
"
6,3,Maury,"Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you.
"
6,3,"Stan, Kyle","Wait, here it is, here it is!
"
6,3,Cartman,"The present.
"
6,3,Maury,"Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world!
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh really?
"
6,3,Kyle,"Wow!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Did he say ""the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world""?
"
6,3,Maury,"Go on, you're going right now!! 
"
6,3,Stan,"But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
"
6,3,Kyle,"Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?  Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin.  I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?
"
6,3,Operator,"I'm sorry, but we're done doing freak shows for now. We're looking for people for a new topic.
"
6,3,Cartman,"What's the new topic?
"
6,3,Operator,"Please help my out-of-control child.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!
"
6,3,Operator,"Really?  Is your mother in tears every day over how disobedient you are?
"
6,3,Cartman,"Uh, sure!
"
6,3,Operator,"Does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age?
"
6,3,Cartman,"Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and pot pourri, and queazies
"
6,3,Operator,"Well that's great! If you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out.
"
6,3,Cartman,"...my, my mom?
"
6,3,Cartman,"Mmoooomm?
"
6,3,Liane,"Yes, sweetie?
"
6,3,Cartman,"Could yo do me a favor?
"
6,3,Liane,"What's that, my little man?
"
6,3,Cartman,"Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt gold course in the wwoooorrlldd?
"
6,3,Liane,"Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.
"
6,3,Cartman,"I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?
"
6,3,Liane,"Orf course I do.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.
"
6,3,Liane,"Sweetie, don't.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother.
"
6,3,Linda,"Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh I'm sorry, mom.
"
6,3,Chris,"Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!
"
6,3,Butters,"Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.
"
6,3,Chris,"Ugh! You'd better believe you won't, buster!
"
6,3,Linda,"Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!
"
6,3,Butters,"Yes ma'am. 
"
6,3,Butters,"Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? 
"
6,3,Stan,"Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh Jesus! They were??
"
6,3,Stan,"Yeah, they wanted to find you bad.
"
6,3,Butters,"Well Oh, God! W-whatdya tell him?
"
6,3,Stan,"I- told them where to find you.
"
6,3,Butters,"What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
"
6,3,Stan,"Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. 
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh Jesus no.  They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here!  Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! 
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Napoleon? 
"
6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Napoleon Bonaparte?  I think he's up here. 
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh, hello, folks. Uh what's the problem?
"
6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"There you are, Boy With Balls On His Chin.
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"We've got big news! The union is striking.
"
6,3,Butters,"The union? Oh, that's why you came?
"
6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"We're tired of our crappy prizes! So the union president, Man with Terrible Skin Condition, has told us to round everyone up.
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Grounded for what?
"
6,3,Butters,"For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'.  Ah I'm not grounded.
"
6,3,Man With No Face,"Good, then you can march with us. Freaks of the world,

6,3,The Freaks,"Unite! 
"
6,3,Announcer,"Today on Maury Povich: These moms  don't know what to do with their out-of-control kids!  Young boys and girls so whorish on our show that it borders on child pornography!
"
6,3,Maury,"We're here talking with moms who think their children are out of control.  Vanessa here says that her thirteen-year-old daughter Vanity is already doing drugs and having sex with older men 
"
6,3,Studio Audience,"Ooohhhhhhhh
"
6,3,Maury,"Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework.
"
6,3,Vanessa,"She says she hates me. She, she calls me ""retard""? And, she says my cooch is all dried up and nobody wants it. 
"
6,3,Studio Audience,"Aawwwwww. 
"
6,3,Maury,"Well, let's bring her out. Here's Vanity! 
"
6,3,Vanity,"Wha'evah, wha'evah! You fuckin' cocksuckers don't know shit! Fuck you! 
"
6,3,Maury,"Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen.

"
6,3,Vanessa,"Why can't you just listen to me and love me  Ow!
"
6,3,Vanity,"Shu' up! Shut the fuck  up, you God-aweful skank! 
"
6,3,Liane,"I'm glad you're not that bad, poopsie-kins
"
6,3,Cartman,"But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?
"
6,3,Stagehand,"Second door on the right.
"
6,3,The Freaks,"Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"Brothers and sisters, the time has come for us to be treated with the respect we deserve! We are a strong and diverse group of people, with members like  Woman with Crablike Body,  Incredibly Obese Black Person,  Man with Brains Outside of Head, and  Liza Minnelli. The talk shows have us on and give us little gifts and perks while they make tens of thousands of dollars.
"
6,3,The Freaks,"Yeah!
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"We told the talk shows our demands, and they laughed! They say they can get plenty of other stupid guests to go on their shows! So we must picket those other guests!
"
6,3,The Freaks,"Yeah!
"
6,3,Butters,"Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.
"
6,3,Hammerhead Man,"You're not gonna picket?
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"Who's not gonna picket? 
"
6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Boy with Balls on Chin doesn't wanna picket. 
"
6,3,Butters,"Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
"
6,3,Man with No Limbs,"Why? You're not a SCAB, are you?
"
6,3,Butters,"NO I I'm not a scab.
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"Now, we will split up into groups and form picket lines. The first group will be led by: Incredibly Obese Black Man.
"
6,3,Incredibly Obese Black Man,"Escuse me, I'm not Incredibly Obese Black Man, I'm Incredibly Black Obese Man.
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"...Oh, right. My bad.
"
6,3,Announcer,"And now, back to more kids who are out of control, on the Maury Povich show!
"
6,3,Maury,"Our next mother is Liane Cartman. Her son claims to be the most out-of-control kid in the world and says there's nothing his stupid mom can do about it.
"
6,3,Studio Audience,"Awww.
"
6,3,Vanessa,"Why won't you kids behave? 
"
6,3,Vanity,"Shut up, skank, he's not talkin' to you! 
"
6,3,Maury,"So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child?
"
6,3,Liane,"Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle
"
6,3,Maury,"Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look. 
"
6,3,Cartman,"Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
"
6,3,Studio Audience,"BOOOO!!
"
6,3,Liane,"Oh, he's such a cutie.
"
6,3,Maury,"Well, let's bring him out. Here's Eric Cartman! 
"
6,3,Cartman,"Wha'evah! Wha'evah!  Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!
"
6,3,Maury,"Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do?
"
6,3,Liane,"Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Mom, we're pretending, remember? Sex and drugs.
"
6,3,Liane,"Oh, I mean, sex and drugs.
"
6,3,Studio Audience,"Oooohhh!
"
6,3,Cartman,"What-evah! What-evah!  I'll do what I waunt!
"
6,3,Vanity,"Oh, what-evah. You ain't tough, ho! I roam with gangs!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! 
"
6,3,Vanity,"What Evah! You ain't bad! You ain't nothin'! I ditch class and go shoot heroin in the school bathroom!
"
6,3,Cartman,"What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"What do we want?
"
6,3,The Freaks,"Better prizes!
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"When do we want them?
"
6,3,The Freaks,"Now!
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"What do we want?
"
6,3,The Freaks,"Better prizes!
"
6,3,Butters,"Better prizes.
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"When do we want them?
"
6,3,The Freaks,"Now!
"
6,3,Butters,"Never.  Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"Napoleon, you need to understand something: for a union to work all members must be prepared to make sacrifices and stick together.
"
6,3,Butters,"But I gotta get back to my family.
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"We're you family too, Napoleon. We're like you. When we look at you we don't even see the testicles on your chin. We see the testicles in your heart.  What do we want?
"
6,3,The Freaks,"Better prizes!
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"When do we want them?
"
6,3,The Freaks,"Now!
"
6,3,Butters,"Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. 
"
6,3,Police Captain,"Okay folks, we're gonna have to move along.
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Why? We're a union and we have a right to picket.
"
6,3,Police Captain,"I'm sorry, but the government does not recognize you as a union. You'll have to go.
"
6,3,Middle Dwarf,"What are you saying? That because of our appearance our organization is less important?
"
6,3,Police Captain,"Now now now, I'm not telling you people that your union doesn't matter, I'm just telling you that you're not really... people.
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"...Alright, that does it! It's time to bring out the big guns! Prepare the video sabotage!
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh no, not the video sabotage, uh.
"
6,3,Announcer,"...child? We're back with Maury.
"
6,3,Maury,"We're here, talking with moms who think their children are out of control.
"
6,3,Vanity,"What evah!
"
6,3,Cartman,"I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
"
6,3,Maury,"Now let's meet Joline. Joline says that her daughter is also out of control, that she's flirting with older men, and, she's only four months old.
"
6,3,Studio Audience,"Aawwww.
"
6,3,Joline,"Mmhmm, that's right Maurih.
"
6,3,Maury,"Let's bring her out: here's Chantal!  So Joline, exactly how is your daughter out of control? You say she flirts with older men? 
"
6,3,Joline,"Maurih, it's like this: Whenever I have friends over to the house Chantal will come waltzin' in the livin' room completely naked!
"
6,3,Studio Audience,"Ooohhh!
"
6,3,Vanity,"Whatevah. I helped in a drive-by shooting.
"
6,3,Cartman,"What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
"
6,3,Maury,"Wow, that is out of control!
"
6,3,Joline,"Why, just last night I had three gentlemen callers over to my house, and Chantal took her clothes off right in front o' everybody!
"
6,3,Studio Audience,"Boooo! 
"
6,3,Joline,"You see?  There she goes. There she goes.  OH! YOU GOD-DAMNED WHORE!
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Attention Maury viewers
"
6,3,Maury,"What the hell is this? 
"
6,3,Elephant Man,"A lot of decent hard-working freaks in America are losing their talk-show jobs to freaks of a different nature. Sure, everyone in this great country of hours is a freak, but true, physically deformed freaks must be recognized, for it's these real freaks that make you all feel better about yourselves for not being one. So next time you're watching television, make sure it's a show with ""freak"" freaks, and not just with people that are freaks because they're stupid trailer trash from the South. That's what we mean when we say, ""Look for the True Freak label"" 
"
6,3,Butters and the Freaks,"Look for the True Freak label
When you are watching a TV talk show
Remember somewhere,
our union's growing
Our wages going to feed the kids.
And run the house-
We work hard, but who's complaining?
With TFU we're making our way!
So always look for the True Freak label,
Because you need us right here in the U.S.A.!
"
6,3,Maury,"Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-
"
6,3,Man,"They're right. We should have never crossed that picket line. Come on, honey. 
"
6,3,Maury,"Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants! 
"
6,3,Cameraman,"Sir, the ratings have just started to plummet.
"
6,3,Maury,"Ah, those damned freaks! 
"
6,3,Maury,"I gave you shoes! And groceries! And this is how you repay me?!  Very well. Just come upstairs and... we'll negotiate! 
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"We did it! The strike worked!
"
6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"Now we can go on with our careers!
"
6,3,Butters,"Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. 
"
6,3,Cartman,"Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! 
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh. Double hamburgers.
"
6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Jesus Christ! That out-of-control kid ripped poor Napoleon's balls right off!
"
6,3,Incredibly Obese Black Man,"Get him!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Aaahh! 
"
6,3,Incredibly Obese Black Man,"Get him! Get him! 
"
6,3,Butters,"Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. 
"
6,3,Chris,"Butters!
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh I know.
"
6,4,Ms. Choksondik,"Okay children, step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - I mean, rancher.
"
6,4,Rancher,"Hello, boys and girls. My name is Rancher Bob.
"
6,4,Ms. Choksondik,"Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob.
"
6,4,Kids,"Hi, Rancher Bob.
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful world of beef. Follow me.
"
6,4,Kyle,"City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"Now, out here you can see our cattle. This is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death. 
"
6,4,Cartman,"They look so delicious. 
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"Now here we have the slaughterhouse. This is where we turn the cows into steaks and burgers. 
"
6,4,Kids,"Eewwww!!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Aw, dude. 
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"Hey, anybody want a free sample?
"
6,4,Cartman,"Memememee!
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"And in here, boys and girls, we have our...  veal ranch.  You see, with veal the whole key is keepin' the cows chained so they can't walk around or get any exercise. That way, their muscle tissue stays soft, and makes for tender veal.
"
6,4,Stan,"Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"Yeppir.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Then why the hell do they call it ""veal""??
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"Well, if we called it ""little baby cow"" people might not eat it.
"
6,4,Stan,"Yeah, I wouldn't have.
"
6,4,Butters,"Huh, me neither.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious
"
6,4,Kyle,"What??
"
6,4,Cartman,"Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"Well, no, but all these veals are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. They'll be steaks by tomorrow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Alriiight!
"
6,4,Stan,"Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
6,4,Stan,"Pst, Cartman.
"
6,4,Cartman,"No, Uncle Jesse, no!
"
6,4,Stan,"Cartman, wake up!
"
6,4,Cartman,"What? What the hell are you guys doing??
"
6,4,Kyle,"Come on, we've gotta go!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Where are we going?
"
6,4,Stan,"We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
"
6,4,Cartman,"What? Why?
"
6,4,Kyle,"'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!
"
6,4,Cartman,"So?
"
6,4,Stan,"So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me ""fatass,"" ""butthole,"" and ""douchebag."" I really don't feel like you guys's friend. 
"
6,4,Stan,"We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
"
6,4,Butters,"Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the ""Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset.""
"
6,4,Stan,"Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oho! So you indeed me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!
"
6,4,Stan,"Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
"
6,4,Cartman,"Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. 
"
6,4,Kyle,"What?!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Screw you, Cartman!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it.
"
6,4,Stan,"Go on, dude it's the only way.
"
6,4,Kyle,"No!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.
"
6,4,Stan,"Just do it really fast, and we can go.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Have Butters kiss it.
"
6,4,Cartman,"No, it has to be Kyle. 
"
6,4,Kyle,"Awww! 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh man, that was soho awesome!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Sick! I felt it on my face!
"
6,4,Stan,"Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Hell, I'm not goin' with you!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Hyaaaa! 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Heeeey! 
"
6,4,Butters,"Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: ""Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime.""
"
6,4,Stan,"Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?
"
6,4,Cartman,"Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask  and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. 
"
6,4,Stan,"Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
"
6,4,Cartman,"You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
"
6,4,Stan,"I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
"
6,4,Kyle,"You need to freeze some of your ass off.
"
6,4,Cartman,"O! At least I have as ass, Jew!
"
6,4,Kyle,"What? 
"
6,4,Stan,"Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 
"
6,4,Butters,"Huuh what's the matter?
"
6,4,Stan,"They aren't leaving.
"
6,4,Cartman,"See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
"
6,4,Stan,"Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
"
6,4,Butters,"No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
"
6,4,Stan,"Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
"
6,4,Stan,"I don't know.
"
6,4,Cartman,"I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
"
6,4,Butters,"Eh yeah I do too!
"
6,4,Stan,"We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Eh! 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
"
6,4,Stan,"We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Butters has that at his house?
"
6,4,Butters,"Hey fellas!
"
6,4,Stan,"Butters!  Did you bring it?
"
6,4,Butters,"I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
"
6,4,Kyle,"All right!
"
6,4,Butters,"""Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser.""
"
6,4,Stan,"What?
"
6,4,Butters,"""Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!""
"
6,4,Kyle,"Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?
"
6,4,Butters,"Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.
"
6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Mr. Marsh.
"
6,4,Sharon,"Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?
"
6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property.
"
6,4,Sharon,"Stole? A-a-are you sure? 
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"I followed a calf-curling path right to your house, ma'am.
"
6,4,Shelly,"Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.
"
6,4,Sharon,"Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding.  Stanley, did you see-? 
"
6,4,Stan,"Aw crap!
"
6,4,Sharon,"Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?
"
6,4,Stan,"That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
"
6,4,Randy,"Stanley, they belong to him.
"
6,4,Stan,"They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
"
6,4,Shelly,"Let me hit him, Mom!
"
6,4,Sharon,"Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and  you don't have a choice!  Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!
"
6,4,Stan,"No!
"
6,4,Randy,"Stan, you're behaving like a kid!
"
6,4,Stan,"You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer! 
"
6,4,Sharon,"Open this door, now!
"
6,4,Stan,"Kiss my ass!
"
6,4,Butters,"Oh Jeez, he said ""ass"" to his parents.
"
6,4,Kyle,"You're getting in pretty deep, dude. 
"
6,4,Sharon,"I apologize for this, Mr. rancher person.
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"Oh, why, why don't you just tell them that the cows will be safe. And when they come out I can take them back.
"
6,4,Sharon,"I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life.
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's eight hundred dollars' worth of veal up there and I have to ship it out Friday. What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady?
"
6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Me?? How did I get into this mess?
"
6,4,Kyle,"So what happens now?
"
6,4,Stan,"I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
"
6,4,Kyle,"We're with you, dude.
"
6,4,Butters,"Yeah.
"
6,4,Stan,"Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
"
6,4,Cartman,"I want out.
"
6,4,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman.
"
6,4,Kyle,"We're with you, Stan.
"
6,4,Butters,"Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
"
6,4,Stan,"Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
"
6,4,"Kyle, Butters","Yeah!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Yeah! Wait-what?
"
6,4,Sharon,"And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promosie them the calves will live free, in writing.
"
6,4,Sheila,"Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!
"
6,4,Sharon,"We excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!
"
6,4,Sheila,"HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open!  Kyle?!  This is your mother! You will open this door right now!
"
6,4,Kyle,"...No I won't.
"
6,4,Sharon,"Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila.  That was very impressive.
"
6,4,Sheila,"Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!
"
6,4,Sharon,"Very persuasive.
"
6,4,Sheila,"AAAAA! Open this door!! Open this door!!
"
6,4,Chris,"Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try.  Butters?  Butters, this is your father.
"
6,4,Butters,"Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?
"
6,4,Stan,"Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
"
6,4,Chris,"Butters? Answer me!
"
6,4,Butters,"But they-ah they're angry at me.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...
"
6,4,Chris,"Butters! Right now!
"
6,4,Butters,"Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?
"
6,4,Chris,"WHAT?!
"
6,4,Butters,"Oh, sweet Jesus.
"
6,4,Chris,"What's gotten into them?
"
6,4,Sharon,"Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!
"
6,4,Stan,"This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.
"
6,4,Sharon,"Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit you guys.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Cartman, stay away from that door!
"
6,4,Sharon,"You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in. 
"
6,4,Sheila,"Mmmrragh!!
"
6,4,Stan,"Round one is over. We made it. 
"
6,4,Cartman,"We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!
"
6,4,Stan,"Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
"
6,4,Kyle,"But we will have to sleep, dude.
"
6,4,Stan,"Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
"
6,4,Butters,"Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!
"
6,4,Stan,"We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 
"
6,4,Randy,"Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.
"
6,4,Gerald,"Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours!
"
6,4,Liane,"Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.
"
6,4,Sharon,"Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all.
"
6,4,Liane,"Oh, all right.
"
6,4,Sheila,"Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.
"
6,4,Butters,"Good night, fellas!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Good night.
"
6,4,Butters,"Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Can't go on. Need... food...
"
6,4,Kyle,"We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
"
6,4,Cartman,"There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.
"
6,4,Stan,"No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!
"
6,4,Cartman,"All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. 
"
6,4,Kyle,"He might be right, dude.
"
6,4,Butters,"Aw, heck. 
"
6,4,Stan,"Wait, what is that?  Dude!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Food!
"
6,4,Sharon,"Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?
"
6,4,Liane,"Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer
"
6,4,Sharon,"Oh dear God, you've ruined everything.
"
6,4,Kyle,"All right!
"
6,4,Stan,"See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Look you guys! Beef jerky!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Yeah! And fried chicken! 
"
6,4,Stan,"Wha? 
"
6,4,"Kyle, Cartman","Mmmmm.
"
6,4,Stan,"Dude, what are you guys doing?
"
6,4,Kyle,"We're eating, dude.
"
6,4,Stan,"You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
"
6,4,Butters,"Me neither.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.
"
6,4,Stan,"That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?
"
6,4,Kyle,"Dude, that's messed up. 
"
6,4,Kyle,"You guys, check this out! 
"
6,4,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where three insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle.
"
6,4,Butters,"Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh
"
6,4,Field Reporter,"Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say.
"
6,4,"Craig's father, Tom","We were sleeping when suddenly we heard all the commotion. I mean, to think this could happen right here in our own community. 
"
6,4,Randy,"We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!
"
6,4,Field Reporter,"The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists.
"
6,4,Butters,"Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.
"
6,4,Stan,"No, this is exactly what we wanted.
"
6,4,Kyle,"It is?
"
6,4,Stan,"Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
"
6,4,Field Reporter,"Tom, it looks like I have an update: Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make seem important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to ""Puppoies from Around the World.""
"
6,4,Stan,"...I don't believe it.
"
6,4,Butters,"Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
"
6,4,Stan,"Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 
"
6,4,Butters,"Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. 
"
6,4,Voices,"We must help the helpless, we must save the unsaved
"
6,4,Kyle,"Huh, what the hell is that?
"
6,4,Hippies,"If we... fight together we can make sure the road is paved.For a... brighter tomorrow...
"
6,4,Cartman,"Hippies!
"
6,4,Stan,"What are they doing here?
"
6,4,Hippie,"We're with you boys! Your message is real and your voice is just. 
"
6,4,Hippies,"Hooray! Hooray!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?
"
6,4,Butters,"Ew, they're all dirty.
"
6,4,Cartman,"What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
"
6,4,Field Reporter,"Tom, the calf terrorist standoff continues as now members of the FBI arrive to put an end to the conflict. 
"
6,4,Sharon,"Oh Jesus Christ. 
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"Who's in charge here?
"
6,4,Officer Barbrady,"I am. But I don't want to be.
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"Where's the negotiator?
"
6,4,FBI Negotiator,"Right here! Glen Dumont, Negotiator Squad
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"All right, see what you can do.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Dude, are you okay?
"
6,4,Stan,"Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. 
"
6,4,Butters,"What is that?
"
6,4,Kyle,"Dude, maybe we should end this.
"
6,4,Stan,"No!
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Give me a hard line to the phone in that house! 
"
6,4,Officer Barbardy,"The terrorists already said there's no way they're coming out.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Don't worry, I'm a negotiator. It's my job to talk to freaks like this and bring about a peaceful resolution using clever psychology.
"
6,4,Stan,"Hello?
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Hello, my name is Mike. I'm a negotiator. Is it okay if I talk to you?
"
6,4,Stan,"Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
"
6,4,Kyle,"Don't give him anything!
"
6,4,Stan,"What do I say??
"
6,4,Cartman,"Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"I'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. You want that, right?
"
6,4,Cartman,"Sure, sure.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"How about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other.
"
6,4,Cartman,"What do you have in mind?
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Well, how about you send out one of the calves?
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Just one, that's all we want.
"
6,4,Cartman,"All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
"
6,4,Stan,"Cartman, no!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Dude! 
"
6,4,Cartman,"We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"What? I, I can't do that.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuh, you're right. What reason do you have to trust me? I'm just a guy from Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? Just a blue-collar guy like your dad.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Oh. All right, fine, son of a gun, let me see what I can do.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Okay. Up a little... left a little...  Almost there.
"
6,4,Randy,"What is that?
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"We're giving the boys some guns in return for our calves
"
6,4,Randy,"What?
"
6,4,Sharon,"You're giving my baby guns?
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Hey, this is a negotiation process, okay? Did you people go to negotiator school? No, you didn't!  Get them on the line for me!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Hello.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Alright, you see that? I keep my end of the bargain.
"
6,4,Cartman,"All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. 
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Well, ha- how about you send out two calves?
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! 
"
6,4,Stan,"O-ogh...
"
6,4,Cartman,"We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! 
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Damnit, I'm losing them.  Okay, I'm sorry. Just send out one calf.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! 
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"What do you have in mind?
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"A little to the left...  Okay, that's good. A little to the right. 
"
6,4,Sheila,"You're giving them a missile??
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Stand down, ma'am! Stand down! This is a delicate process! I've almost earned their trust!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Stan's getting worse, you guys.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Mike, speak.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"How are we doin'?
"
6,4,Cartman,"We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Weh ah I did manage to get the FDA to officially change the word ""veal"" to ""tortured baby cow."" 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Good, good.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"But I couldn't get you North and South Dakota.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Now, now please can, can we get you to come out? 
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"All right, everythng has worked out. The boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them.
"
6,4,Adults,"Yes! All right! Woohoo!
"
6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator.
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"They're coming out now?
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"Yes. All we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to Denver International Airport, where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to Mexico.
"
6,4,Sharon,"What??
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"And they want the guy that plays Mr. Worf on ""Star Trek"" to drive the truck.  In full makeup.
"
6,4,Randy,"Jesus Christ!
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"All right, that does it! You are in fact the worst negotiator I've ever seen in action!
"
6,4,Glen Dumont,"All right, all right, I'll give you that. But in return, I want three staples.
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"Get out of here!  We'll get them the semi, and we'll get them the Worf guy. If they see that, thay'll come out and then, we could take them.
"
6,4,Officer Barbrady,"But isn't that dishonest?
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"Maybe so, but if we don't do something soon, there could be fifty, even sixty people who'll have to go without veal for dinner. Are you prepared to let that happen?
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"All right. Where is Mr. Dorn?
"
6,4,Michael Dorn,"I was woken up at three in the mornng, told I had to put on makeup, and come to this town.  What the hell is gong on?!
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"I'm sorry, Mr. Dorn. It's FBI business. We've got terrorists making demands and we need your help.
"
6,4,Michael Dorn,"This is highly unusual!
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"All right boys, we have your truck. And we have an airplane on the tarmac at Denver International.
"
6,4,Cartman,"And Worf?
"
6,4,Michael Dorn,"My name is Michael Dorn. I play a character called Worf.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Stan! It worked!
"
6,4,Stan,"It... did?
"
6,4,Kyle,"They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
"
6,4,Stan,"Pick me up. I... I want to see. 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Step back! Tell those men to step back!
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"Do it!
"
6,4,FBI Agents,"Mmrrrr.
"
6,4,Hippies,"All right! Woohoo! Yeah!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as ""Captain.""
"
6,4,Michael Dorn,"Where am I supposed to drive to?
"
6,4,Cartman,"No. See, must say, ""Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?""
"
6,4,Michael Dorn,"Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?
"
6,4,Cartman,"You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
"
6,4,Michael Dorn,"This whole thing is ridiculous!
"
6,4,Cartman,"""Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!""
"
6,4,Michael Dorn,"Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous. 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Okay, all set!
"
6,4,Field Reporter,"Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom.
"
6,4,Butters,"Okay Cartman!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Step on it, Mr. Worf! 
"
6,4,Boys,"All right!
"
6,4,Butters,"We're going! 
"
6,4,Kyle,"Mexico here we come! 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
"
6,4,Michael Dorn,"We cannot keep going fast on these icy roads!
"
6,4,Cartman,"""Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?""
"
6,4,Michael Dorn,"Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"Alright, they're in front of the cattle ranch. Hit it! 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, it's a double-cross!!
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"Alright, boys! The game is over! Get out of the truck with your hands up!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Oh no! No!!
"
6,4,Cartman,"What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
"
6,4,Michael Dorn,"I'm NOT killing anybody!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
"
6,4,Stan,"We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!
"
6,4,FBI Agent,"Alright boys, just stay right there until your parents arrive.
"
6,4,Michael Dorn,"Can I go now?
"
6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"Oh.  Well, it doesn't matter now.
"
6,4,Officer Barbrady,"What you do mean?
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"You see, in the six days since the word ""veal"" was officially changed to ""little tortured baby cow"" the market has gone dry. Seems that people see ""little tortured baby cow"" on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'.
"
6,4,Butters,"Really?
"
6,4,Rancher Bob,"Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? 
"
6,4,Dr. Doctor,"He's very lucky you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis.
"
6,4,Randy,"Vaginitis?
"
6,4,Dr. Doctor,"It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Whoa, dude.
"
6,4,Dr. Doctor,"We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Thank God we stopped it in time.
"
6,4,Stan,"Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
"
6,4,Butters,"Hear hear.
"
6,4,Sheila,"All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.
"
6,4,Chris,"I'll say!
"
6,4,Butters,"Aw, we're still grounded?
"
6,4,Kyle,"But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
"
6,4,Gerald,"Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer.
"
6,4,Chris,"That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms.  But first,  maybe we can grab some burgers.
"
6,4,The Boys,"All right!
"
6,5,Stan,"This is gonna be so awesome!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Do we have everything?
"
6,5,Stan,"Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!
"
6,5,Cartman,"All right!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Look, it's almost time.
"
6,5,Announcer,"Up next on HBC, the Russell Crowe Show!
"
6,5,Stan,"Alright, here we go.
"
6,5,Choir,"Born in New Zealand in sixty-four

"
6,5,Man,"Oh, excuse me. I was just-  God-damned smartass! Do you think you could 
"
6,5,Stan,"Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!
"
6,5,Shelly,"Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy.
"
6,5,Stan,"No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Oh! Get up! Get up, you little pussy! 
"
6,5,Shelly,"The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!
"
6,5,Russell Crowe (off-screen),"Oh ya like that do ya?! 
"
6,5,Stan,"It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
"
6,5,Kyle,"It's the biggest night of the year.
"
6,5,Shelly,"That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time!
"
6,5,Stan,"But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
"
6,5,Shelly,"No, turds!
"
6,5,Cartman,"Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
"
6,5,Shelly,"Shut up, fat turd!!
"
6,5,Cartman,"I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!
"
6,5,Shelly,"We're not watching this! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Come on!
"
6,5,Man,"Look, I apologize, but I was just--
"
6,5,Stan,"But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
"
6,5,Shelly,"There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!
"
6,5,Stan,"Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
"
6,5,Shelly,"All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it!
"
6,5,Stan,"O-K, deal.
"
6,5,Shelly,"And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't it, kids? But if looks like if we're gonna get in more fights, we're gonna have to go look for 'em.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/
"
6,5,Butters,"Ehyeah!
"
6,5,Stan,"Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
"
6,5,Kyle,"You'd miss the new trailer?
"
6,5,Stan,"Dude, I'm not going.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? 
"
6,5,Stan,"Stan.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Stan, okay. What's your name? 
"
6,5,Kyle,"Kyle.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Kyle. What's your name? 
"
6,5,Butters,"Butters! Aw, I lose, huh?
"
6,5,Cartman,"Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Seems like no one else here wants to fight.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Dude, thank God for stupid people 
"
6,5,Cartman,"Amen.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"...lets ask our old friend, Tugger. Where should we go fight people next, Tugger?
"
6,5,Tugger,"TOOOOOOT
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Great idea!  Tugger thinks we should go to the faaar away of China.  China is one of the oldest civilizations on earth. And from what I understand, they LOVE a good fight! So let's go! 
"
6,5,Tugger,"TOOOT TOOOT 
"
6,5,Man with Mustache,"Oh my God! It's Russell Crowe!
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe! Oh my Gmah, bah bah byah byah!  Why don't you mind your own business, you scrotum?! 
Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world.
"
6,5,Stan,"Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"What a glorious day to spend a way, fight-in' round the world. 
"
6,5,Cartman,"What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. 
"
6,5,Stan,"They look fine to me. 
"
6,5,Kyle,"Just don't mess with it, Cartman.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. 
"
6,5,Kyle,"Just just leave it alone.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? 
"
6,5,Stan,"That's worse!
"
6,5,Cartman,"Okay, how about ... that? 
"
6,5,Stan,"Dude!
"
6,5,Kyle,"God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!
"
6,5,Cartman,"It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!
"
6,5,Stan,"Dude, the commercials could start any time!
"
6,5,Cartman,"I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
"
6,5,Kyle,"God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
"
6,5,Stan,"Get all the stuff! 
"
6,5,Butters,"Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?
"
6,5,Stan,"We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh Jeez. 
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh boy, uh, Oh Jeez, Oh Jeez

"
6,5,Stan,"Huff, huff
"
6,5,Butters,"Huh uh hurry! Hurry! Hurry! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"And so here we are in history-rich Ch-ooina.
"
6,5,Kyle,"We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 
"
6,5,"Kyle, Stan, Butters","Phew!
"
6,5,Ike,"Hey! Imong telling Dat!
"
6,5,Cartman,"Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.
"
6,5,Ike,"Dadadadat!
"
6,5,Kyle,"No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"This is Tianinman Square. Lots of good foightin' has gone on here throughout the years, including a fan-tastic massacre that took place back in '93.  These chinamen can grow to over five feet tall, and in a fight, are known to kick with their legs. Let's see if we can get in for a closer look.  Oi!  I've gotten close enough now that they're startin' to get real froigh'ened. You can see the fine hairs on the back of their necks standin' on end.  Gotcha mate!  Ah, you wanna fight, huh?!  Think you could take me, you little buggers?! 
"
6,5,Cartman,"God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? 
"
6,5,Gerald,"Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV.
"
6,5,Kyle,"They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
"
6,5,Gerald,"You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!
"
6,5,Ike,"Etetheh bunlapala un night.
"
6,5,Kyle,"But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.
"
6,5,Gerald,"It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer
"
6,5,Kyle,"God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.
"
6,5,Stan,"Aww! 
"
6,5,Cartman,"Argh!
"
6,5,Butters,"Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my house.
"
6,5,Cartman,"We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
"
6,5,Stan,"AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! 
"
6,5,Ike,"It's a burning flag.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!
"
6,5,Kyle,"God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
"
6,5,Chef,"Oh. Hello there, children.
"
6,5,The Boys,"Hey Chef. 
"
6,5,Chef,"Uh, how's it goin'?
"
6,5,Chef,"Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh?  Pretty cool, ain't it?
"
6,5,Stan,"Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?
"
6,5,Chef,"Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle.  I can't figure it out at all. 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"-bloomin' Taj Mahal.
"
6,5,Cartman,"There, you got it, you got it!
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Freakin' Indies  really put up a  fight!
"
6,5,Stan,"We made it!
"
6,5,Cartman,"Oh, thank God.
"
6,5,Chef,"Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure.
"
6,5,Cartman,"We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer about the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Alright everyone, we're gonna take our first commercial break. But be sure not to go anywhere, because there's lot's more people to beat up!
"
6,5,Stan,"Here they come!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Heuh, the commercials! 
"
6,5,Announcer,"And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin' Around The World!
"
6,5,The Boys,"Awww!
"
6,5,Butters,"Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.
"
6,5,Stan,"I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world.  Oi! Now Tugger's brought me to one of the greatest places for foightin' in North America.  Brooklyn, New York. Lots of minorities here, and they don't take kindly to whitey.  Let's get a closer look. Come on, Tugger!  Looks like we got some black people, and some Puerto Ricans.  Notice the colorful rags on their heads, meaning they could be part of a gang, and therefore,  real used to fightin'. 
"
6,5,Black Player,"Hey, look at that guy over there. Ain't that that Gladiator guy?
"
6,5,Puerto Rican Player,"Where?
"
6,5,Black Player,"Behind that plant, next to that tugboat? 
"
6,5,Puerto Rican Player,"Oh yeah, I think it is.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Oh my God, it's the Gladiator guy!  Oh my God, I've never seen an actor before!  Why don't you choke on some pig vomit, you stupid sobs!
"
6,5,Chef,"Why can't this guy control his temper?
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Well?? You all just gonna stand there or are you gonna fight?  Crikey, you've done it now!
"
6,5,Cartman,"This TV is great, Chef.
"
6,5,Chef,"Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool feature, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here-  No, no wait. You hit this button here  No, that's not it. Let's see.  Menu...  Function 
"
6,5,Stan,"Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. 
"
6,5,Chef,"Let's see.  Aw, dammit!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Get it back to normal, Chef!
"
6,5,Chef,"I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function-  Enter? No, no. Back? H.E.M?? 
"
6,5,The TV,"Human eradication mode, active. 
"
6,5,Stan,"Oh God-dammit!
"
6,5,Kyle,"The TV left.
"
6,5,Butters,"Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.
"
6,5,Stan,"Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! 
"
6,5,Butters,"Whre do we go? Where do we go?
"
6,5,Stan,"The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
"
6,5,Cartman,"Aagh! God-dammit!
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"You fight like Norwegians, ya fairies!
"
6,5,The Boys,"Phew!
"
6,5,Stan,"We made it.
"
6,5,Cartman,"This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"These are the Florida Keys, a remote island chain just a few miles from... Oi! Wait a minute! Wasn't I just in Brooklyn fightin' minorities? What happened with that?
"
6,5,Tugger,"Mooooot.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"It's that God-damned editor! He cut the Brooklyn scene short! Tugger, I'm gonna get him!
"
6,5,Editor,"Yeah. Oh I'm just working. I'm probably done around seven. 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Who the hell do you think you are?!
"
6,5,Editor,"I'm the editor.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"I know you're the bloomin' editor! I mean, who do you think you are cuttin' one of my foightin' scenes short?!
"
6,5,Editor,"Dude, the director said to cut it.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Moy foightin' is poetry! You don't edit Russell Crowe's poetry, you teesticle! 
"
6,5,Jimbo,"Well that guy's just plain nuts.
"
6,5,Barkeep,"Hey hey hey, whoa, you kids can't be in here. 
"
6,5,Kyle,"We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
"
6,5,Barkeep,"You ain't midgets, your lips are too full.  Now GET OUT!!
"
6,5,Stan,"But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
"
6,5,Barkeep,"Look, this is a bar! We can't have children in here. People come here for debauchery and sin!
"
6,5,Cartman,"Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.
"
6,5,Butters,"Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!
"
6,5,Barkeep,"GET OUT!!! 
"
6,5,The Boys,"Aaah!
"
6,5,Stan,"Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 
"
6,5,Cartman,"Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!
"
6,5,Chef,"Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press ""menu,"" then ""function."" 
"
6,5,Townsman,"Jesus!  Waaaah! 
"
6,5,Chef,"No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no.  Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?
"
6,5,Cartman,"Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! 
"
6,5,Kyle,"We're not too late! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Come on, Tugger ol' mate. Why are you lookin' so down?
"
6,5,Tugger,"Mooot, mooot.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Tugger's in a bit of a sad state. Seems his girlfriend and him had a bit of a row last night.
"
6,5,Tugger,"Mooooot.
"
6,5,Old Man,"...What is this?
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Come on. Cheer up, Tugger. How can I make you feel better? I know!  How would you like me to sing one of the songs off me new album?
"
6,5,Tugger,"Nooo! Nooooo!
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"What's that, Tugger? You say you really love the songs on my album?
"
6,5,Tugger,"Noooooooooo! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Alright then, Tugger. 
"
6,5,Tugger,"Noo, no! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"You know that you're my baby. You know I need you now.
"
6,5,Tugger,"Noooooooooo! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"I don't know where I'm goin', I gotta get there some, yeah gotta get there, somehow.
"
6,5,Tugger,"Noooooooooo! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Gotta get there somehow.
"
6,5,Tugger,"Noooooooooo! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"You can stay away tonight, but I'm gonna sleep here, in my explosive clouds...
"
6,5,Tugger,"NOOOOO! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"SHOUT! Think I feel your heartbeat, can you feel mine... lady lookin' lovely, gotta take your love a shot, gotta take it...
"
6,5,Tugger,"NOOOOO! NOOOOO! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Tugger!  Tugger shot himself!
"
6,5,Announcer,"Has Russell lost Tugger for good? Find out after these messages.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Here we go!
"
6,5,Stan,"Commercial Break Number Two! 
"
6,5,Announcer,"And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin' Around The World!
"
6,5,Cartman,"That's it? That's all the commercials?
"
6,5,Kyle,"They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
"
6,5,Stan,"I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Tugger! Why'd you do it, Tugger?!  Doctor! Tell me how he is, doctor!
"
6,5,Doctor,"Well, he's a very sick little tugboat.
"
6,5,Old Man,"What is this? We wanna watch ""Puppies From Around The World.""
"
6,5,Old Woman,"Yeah. We don't like this show.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"You gotta save him, Doc! Tugger! 'E's my best friend! The only friend in the world who would-
"
6,5,Doctor,"He's going to live, but-
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Oi! Don't you interrupt me, you vag-oina! I was givin' a heart-wrenchin' soliloquy about me feeling's for Tugger!
"
6,5,Doctor,"Sorry.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Oh, Tugger! Tugger, the world won't be as bright without ya, mate! Give it to me straight, doctor! Will Tugger live?! Tell me the truth!
"
6,5,Doctor,"...Now?
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Yes, now's fine.
"
6,5,Doctor,"Oh. Uh, your tugboat's going to be okay. He just needs an oil change and a new steamstack.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Ooo, de-lolly! D'you hear that, everybody?! Tugger's gonna be okay! D'you know what that makes me feel like doin'? Foightin'! 
"
6,5,Old Man,"This show is too violent! Put the puppies back on!
"
6,5,Old Folks,"Yeah!
"
6,5,Old Woman 2,"Please.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!
"
6,5,Old Man 2,"All right, that does it! We know how to get our way! Everyone, on the count of three, release your bowels! One! Two! 
"
6,5,The Boys,"Awww!
"
6,5,Cartman,"Eewww!
"
6,5,Stan,"Oh, God, it's horrible! 
"
6,5,Kyle,"That'd disgusting, dude!
"
6,5,Cartman,"God, I hate old people!
"
6,5,Stan,"We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
"
6,5,Butters,"I told you, we can't go to my house!
"
6,5,Cartman,"And my house is being fumigated!
"
6,5,Stan,"Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Crikey! Ol' Tugger looks healthy, happy, and  fit as a whistle!
"
6,5,Kyle,"It's okay, it's still the show.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"But you know, Tugger's attempted suicide made me realize that I should take up a cause. Most great actors take up causes, and I'm the greatest of 'em all! So, from now on i'm gonna spend all my spare time ...fighting cancer.  Right! Where is that pussy cancer anyway?!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.
"
6,5,Stan,"Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Will your sister let us watch it?
"
6,5,Stan,"She has to! 
"
6,5,Stan,"Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
"
6,5,Butters,"Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh...
"
6,5,Cartman,"Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I lost a doughnut!  Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave no doughnut behind!
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh Jesus! Wait.
"
6,5,Stan,"What?
"
6,5,Butters,"I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. 
"
6,5,The Boys,"AAAAAAAaaaaaaaahhhhh. 
"
6,5,Shelly,"I told you I needed tampons, tuurrddsss!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Look! Crack addicts with a television! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Well, we couldn't find cancer, but we found a man with cancer.  Take that, cancer! And that! 
"
6,5,Tugger,"Mooot Mooot! 
"
6,5,Stan,"The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 
"
6,5,All,"AAAAA! 
"
6,5,Chef,"...Yes, I pressed ""menu"" three times!  No! It's givin' me the same error message!  Yes I read the instruction manual!
"
6,5,The Boys,"Where do we go?!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??
"
6,5,Stan,"We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
"
6,5,Butters,"I'm sure! There's no way!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Well why not?!
"
6,5,Butters,"Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!
"
6,5,Butters,"No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
"
6,5,Kyle,"This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
"
6,5,Stan,"Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 
"
6,5,The Boys,"AAAAA!!
"
6,5,Cartman,"The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! 
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"And so we'll be right back, after these commercials.
"
6,5,Stan,"We made it! 
"
6,5,Kyle,"The last commercial break is starting!
"
6,5,Announcer,"Don't go anywhere. Russell Crowe will be right back after a few more commercials. 
"
6,5,Cartman,"These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!
"
6,5,Stan,"Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
"
6,5,Kyle,"What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
"
6,5,Butters,"They have to show it! They promised they would!
"
6,5,Cartman,"You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.
"
6,5,Kyle,"That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!
"
6,5,Stan,"Wait a minute! Look!  ""The following preview has..."" This is it! This is it!
"
6,5,Announcer,"Coming this summer! The greatest Canadian duo of all time is back.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Woohoo!!! 
"
6,5,"Stan, Kyle, Butters","Yeeeeesss! 
"
6,5,Stan,"That looks AWEsome! 
"
6,5,Kyle,"They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 
"
6,5,Cartman,"Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 
"
6,5,Cartman,"You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see.
"
6,5,Stan,"Oh, dude, let's go!
"
6,5,Butters,"Yeah. 
"
6,5,Kyle,"It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
"
6,5,Cartman,"Yeah, it sure does!
"
6,5,Stan,"I wonder if it's all a western?
"
6,5,Butters,"How far away is June?
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Well, we sure had a good time today, didn't we, kids? We fought some Chinamen, a few peckers, and a lot of Colombians, to name just a few. But I sure am glad we got ol' Wally B. back. Aren't you? 
"
6,5,Wally B.,"I'm glad to be back, Russey! 
"
6,5,A Girl,"Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe!
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Oh my God it's Russell Crowe! Oh my bluh blah bluh!!  Why don't you flush yourself down a toilet, you cu- 
"
6,5,Tugger,"Mooo-oooo.
"
6,5,Russell Crowe,"Uh-oh, Tugger's whistle. You know what that means!
Tugger's whistle's blowin' 
Means we must be goin' 
No more Russell Crowein' for you.
But now don't you start to whine
I'll see ya again next time.
'Cause there's plenty a-more a-fightin' left to do.
Makin' movies, makin' songs, an' fightin' round the world.
See you next time, everybody!
"
6,5,Chef,"So I'm supposed to press ""menu,"" then ""function,"" then ""enter.""
"
6,6,Stan,"Okay, here he comes. 
"
6,6,Kyle,"Who wants to tell him?
"
6,6,Cartman,"I'll do it.
"
6,6,Butters,"Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Butters, could you take a seat, please?
"
6,6,Butters,"Wuh well, sure. 
"
6,6,Cartman,"Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.
"
6,6,Butters,"Wull what is it?
"
6,6,Cartman,"Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap."" 
"
6,6,Butters,"Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
"
6,6,Butters,"Not working out?
"
6,6,Cartman,"I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
"
6,6,Kyle,"Lame
"
6,6,Cartman,"Lame, yes.
"
6,6,Butters,"Well, but ah I can get better.
"
6,6,Stan,"Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
"
6,6,Kyle,"But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
"
6,6,Butters,"Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Yes, well, we weren't.
"
6,6,Butters,"Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.
"
6,6,Kyle,"We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up.
"
6,6,Cartman,"But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right? 
"
6,6,Kyle,"Phew.
"
6,6,"Stan, Cartman","Phew.
"
6,6,Kyle,"Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Who cares?
"
6,6,Stan,"All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
"
6,6,Butters,"The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! 
"
6,6,Butters,"Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 
"
6,6,Linda,"Butters, time for bed.
"
6,6,Butters,"Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
"
6,6,Cartman,"All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?
"
6,6,Clyde,"...What if we don't want to be your friend?
"
6,6,Cartman,"Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.
"
6,6,Bennigan's Chef,"Order twenty-three is up, and uh, order twenty-four is up. 
"
6,6,Man 1,"Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minnestrone.
"
6,6,Man 2,"Yeah, I had the minnestrone over here. 
"
6,6,Butters,"I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 
"
6,6,Stan,"So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
"
6,6,Cartman,"I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. 
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?
"
6,6,Kyle,"Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
"
6,6,Tweek,"What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!
"
6,6,DogPoo,"I think I deserve to take Kenny's place the most, because, I've been hanging around these guys for like five years and I never get to say or do anything.
"
6,6,Cartman,"...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. 
"
6,6,Kyle,"Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.
"
6,6,Towelie,"Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... why is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on.
"
6,6,Cartman,"We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas.
"
6,6,Ride Operator,"O! Shut her down. Someone needs assistance.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points. 
"
6,6,Kyle,"But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what?
"
6,6,Stan,"One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
"
6,6,Butters,"Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! 
"
6,6,Butters,"Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 
"
6,6,Cartman,"All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?
"
6,6,Kyle,"Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy
"
6,6,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
6,6,Tweek,"Oh man! This is too much pressure!
"
6,6,Kyle,"Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .
"
6,6,Cartman,"Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
"
6,6,Kyle,"Tweek.
"
6,6,Tweek,"Aaarr! 
"
6,6,Cartman,"All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! 
"
6,6,DogPoo,"I didn't make the cut?? Oh God, I didn't make the cut??
"
6,6,Dougie,"I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!
"
6,6,Stan,"All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.
"
6,6,Linda,"Good morning, Butters.
"
6,6,Butters,"It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.
"
6,6,Linda,"No,  I didn't hear about that.
"
6,6,Butters,"Yeh, you didn't? 
"
6,6,Butters,"Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
"
6,6,Chris,"Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast. 
"
6,6,Butters,"Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! 
"
6,6,Stan,"Okay, next? 
"
6,6,Kyle,"This looks pretty good.
"
6,6,Stan,"Yeah, it's not bad. Next? 
"
6,6,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
6,6,Cartman,"Next?
"
6,6,Cartman,"Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"Sit down, boys.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Alrighty then. 
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard?  It probably got knocked on the floor somewhere. Can you all just please look around your desks for it? 
"
6,6,Butters,"Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk.  Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five.
"
6,6,Butters,"So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five.
"
6,6,Butters,"Ms. Choksondik,
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"What is it, Butters?
"
6,6,Butters,"Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom pass and go.  Okay, so for instance, children-
"
6,6,Butters,"Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"Just go, Butters.  Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric?
"
6,6,Cartman,"Uh, what's the question again?
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"Five... times...  one.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Five times one is of course...
"
6,6,The Class,"Five.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Five. 
"
6,6,Butters,"The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"Who are you?
"
6,6,Butters,"I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"Hey! That kid took my last eraser!  Come back here, kid! 
"
6,6,Butters,"Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here?
"
6,6,Butters,"Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
"
6,6,Ms. Choksondik,"It looks fine, Butters.  Okay, hold on and stay here, children. 
"
6,6,Kyle,"You're such a fatass, Cartman!
"
6,6,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!
"
6,6,Stan,"Shut up, fatass! 
"
6,6,Craig,"Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. 
"
6,6,Butters,"It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!
"
6,6,Linda,"Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.
"
6,6,Butters,"A note?
"
6,6,Linda,"Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS 
"
6,6,Butters,"Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!
"
6,6,Cartman,"All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?
"
6,6,Pip,"They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.
"
6,6,Tweek,"O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it!
"
6,6,Kyle,"Token.
"
6,6,Token,"All right! 
"
6,6,Kyle,"Timmy.
"
6,6,Timmy,"Timmay! 
"
6,6,Kyle,"Tweek.  Pip
"
6,6,Pip,"Really? I don't believe it. 
"
6,6,Kyle,"Towelie.
"
6,6,Towelie,"What?
"
6,6,Cartman,"Just one more rose, Kyle.
"
6,6,Kyle,"Jimmy.
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Oh boy! Oh thank God! 
"
6,6,Cartman,"All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! 
"
6,6,Clyde,"This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!
"
6,6,Cartman,"Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, ""get the fudge out!"" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
"
6,6,Dougie,"Hey Butters.
"
6,6,Butters,"Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
"
6,6,Dougie,"I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.
"
6,6,Butters,"Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.
"
6,6,Dougie,"I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you.
"
6,6,Butters,"Join me?
"
6,6,Dougie,"Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.
"
6,6,Butters,"But why?
"
6,6,Dougie,"I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing.
"
6,6,Butters,"Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
"
6,6,Dougie,"Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?
"
6,6,Butters,"Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
"
6,6,Dougie,"General Disarray.
"
6,6,Butters,"Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em... 
"
6,6,Cartman,"The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. 
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Well, I don't think I did too well in the... bathing suit competition. But I can't wait for the talent show competition. That'll really my chance to... shine.  Wow, what a terrific audience. So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A guy walks into a b- ...buh...  A guy walks into a guy walks into a  babuh ba-a-a, uh- 
"
6,6,Towelie,"Okay wait...  No, no wait. 
"
6,6,Cartman,"Next please.
"
6,6,Token,"Well, what am I supposed to do?
"
6,6,Kyle,"Anything that'll impress us, Token.
"
6,6,Cartman,"If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?
"
6,6,Token,"Aaaah. Oh, I know. 
"
6,6,Cartman,"Very nice. 
"
6,6,Stan,"I like it. 
"
6,6,Kyle,"Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.
"
6,6,Announcer,"There goes a hit to left field, and Foley's going to score.
"
6,6,All,"Woohoo!
"
6,6,Kyle,"Yeah! Isn't this great?!
"
6,6,Vendor,"Kids, get your drinks here.
"
6,6,Pip,"Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?
"
6,6,Cartman,"You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!
"
6,6,Pip,"Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then.
"
6,6,Cartman,"All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! 
"
6,6,Stan,"Okay, let's try this. 
"
6,6,Cartman,"Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
"
6,6,Butters,"People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!
"
6,6,Man 3,"Flood the world?
"
6,6,Man 4,"My God!
"
6,6,Woman,"I don't wanna die,  I DON'T WANNA DIE!
"
6,6,Butters,"Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 
"
6,6,Man 5,"Jesus Christ, who will save us?
"
6,6,Man 6,"We have very little time to live. How, how shall we spend our last hours on earth? 
"
6,6,Fans,"Yeah! All right! 
"
6,6,Butters,"Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 
"
6,6,Dougie,"It's on all the way.
"
6,6,Butters,"Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.
"
6,6,Stan,"Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 
"
6,6,Cartman,"I think Towelie is awesome.
"
6,6,Kyle,"Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
"
6,6,Stan,"Oh, this is giving me a headache.
"
6,6,Kyle,"Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.
"
6,6,Stan,"You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.
"
6,6,Stan,"How about Token? 
"
6,6,Cartman,"Token's a smartass.
"
6,6,Kyle,"So? You're a smartass!
"
6,6,Cartman,"Yeah. Do we really need another one?
"
6,6,Kyle,"Good point. 
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Oh, thanks Jimmy
"
6,6,Jimmy,"There's some chocolates and lih-licorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside.
"
6,6,Stan,"That's great.
"
6,6,Kyle,"Cool.
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later. 
"
6,6,Cartman,"Alright Jimmy, see ya. 
"
6,6,Stan,"Suckup.
"
6,6,Butters,"Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
"
6,6,Dougie,"Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?
"
6,6,Butters,"Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 
"
6,6,Worker 1,"Is this it?
"
6,6,Worker 2,"Yeah, two thirteen, that's the one. 
"
6,6,Butters,"Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
"
6,6,Dougie,"What do we do now?
"
6,6,Butters,"Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!
"
6,6,Cartman,"Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. 
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please. 
"
6,6,Cartman,"Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? 
"
6,6,Butters,"This is, General Disarray. My final solution. 
"
6,6,Dougie,"What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?
"
6,6,Butters,"Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 
"
6,6,Announcer,"Will Professor Chaos's latest plot succeed and be the final undoing of Earth?  And which boy has been chosen to be the replacement for Kenny?  And which of these six South Park residents was killed, and will never be seen again?  The answer to those questions will be answered... right now.  No.  Tweek.  Ms. Choksondik.
"
6,7,Stan,"Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. 
"
6,7,Tweek,"I can't.  You do it.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Just stick it on.
"
6,7,Tweek,"But what if I put it in the wrong place?
"
6,7,Stan,"Just put it between his eyes.
"
6,7,Tweek,"GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?
"
6,7,Stan,"Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
"
6,7,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
6,7,Butters,"Hey, fellas.
"
6,7,Stan,"Oh, hey Butters.
"
6,7,Butters,"How are things... oing with your new best friend?
"
6,7,Kyle,"Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! 
"
6,7,Tweek,"Arrrr!
"
6,7,Butters,"Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
6,7,Butters,"Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 
"
6,7,Tweek,"Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! 
"
6,7,Cartman,"You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! 
"
6,7,Stan,"Uh oh.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
"
6,7,Tweek,"It's not?
"
6,7,Cartman,"No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
"
6,7,Kyle,"No way.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Nuh uh.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
"
6,7,Kyle,"No way.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
"
6,7,Kyle,"Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
"
6,7,Stan,"Alright, I'll chip in.
"
6,7,Tweek,"Gah! Me too.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Ah, alright.
"
6,7,Linda,"Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!
"
6,7,Butters,"Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! 
"
6,7,Dougie,"Professor Chaos!
"
6,7,Butters,"Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
"
6,7,Dougie,"I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.
"
6,7,Butters,"Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 
"
6,7,Dougie,"What dastardly deed are we doing now?
"
6,7,Butters,"Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!
"
6,7,Dougie,"Oh. 
"
6,7,Butters,"Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
"
6,7,Dougie,"Oh, awesome!
"
6,7,Butters,"Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! 
"
6,7,Dougie,"Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. 
"
6,7,Butters,"Huh?
"
6,7,Dougie,"They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.
"
6,7,Butters,"He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
"
6,7,Dougie,"So how do we build it?
"
6,7,Butters,"Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...
"
6,7,Cartman,"Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
''We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  ""Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly.""  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?
"
6,7,Stan,"Ready. Let's see 'em.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go. 
"
6,7,Stan,"Are they playing basketball? 
"
6,7,Cartman,"What the fuck is this?! 
"
6,7,Stan,"Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
"
6,7,Cartman,"I got RIPPED OFF! 
"
6,7,Kyle,"I told you, Cartman.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep
"
6,7,Tweek,"They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!
"
6,7,Stan,"What are we gonna do with them?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!
"
6,7,Kyle,"Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
"
6,7,Stan,"Yeah, that'd be funny.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Heheh, okay, okay.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!
"
6,7,Tweek,"Jesus Christ, we killed her!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!
"
6,7,Butters,"General Disarray, are your parents home?
"
6,7,Dougie,"No.
"
6,7,Butters,"Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
"
6,7,Dougie,"What?
"
6,7,Butters,"You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!
"
6,7,Dougie,"Oh, uh...
"
6,7,Butters,"Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 
"
6,7,News Anchor,"... but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger.  Also in the news tonight, a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the Powell statue in the South Park Town Square.
"
6,7,Butters,"Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
"
6,7,News Anchor,"The head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads.
"
6,7,Butters,"I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
"
6,7,News Anchor,"This act, of course, reminded us all of the time that Bart Simpson  took the head of the Springfield statue in one of their classic episodes. Here's what some people had to say:
"
6,7,Man 1,"Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons.  Heh, I think it's great.
"
6,7,Woman,"Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh.
"
6,7,Man 2,"Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching.
"
6,7,Butters,"Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.
"
6,7,News Anchor,"The police say that instead of looking for the missing head, they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the Simpsons every day.
"
6,7,Butters,"Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
"
6,7,Dougie,"You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out.
"
6,7,Butters,"Stupid Simpsons...
"
6,7,Terrance,"Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something
"
6,7,Phillip,"Oh, what is it? 
"
6,7,Kyle,"See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
"
6,7,Tweek,"Jesus Christ, she's dead!!
"
6,7,Stan,"Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
"
6,7,Terrance,"Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.
"
6,7,Phillip,"Killing is never an accident, you dickface! 
"
6,7,Stan,"Oh jeez, change the channel.
"
6,7,News Anchor,"And in other news, still no known cause of death found for elementary school teacher Diane Choksondik. However, doctors say that during the autopsy they did find semen in her stomach. 
"
6,7,Stan,"They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!
"
6,7,News Anchor,"The autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Oh God!
"
6,7,Stan,"We're dead!
"
6,7,Tweek,"Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Tweek! Where are you going?
"
6,7,Tweek,"They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!
"
6,7,Stan,"Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
"
6,7,Tweek,"What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
"
6,7,Kyle,"Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
"
6,7,Cartman,"In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.
"
6,7,Tweek,"Rrrr-hr-hrrr!!!
"
6,7,Chef,"Oh, welll, hello there, children.
"
6,7,Stan,"Chef, we did something kind of bad.
"
6,7,Kyle,"We don't know who else to talk to.
"
6,7,Chef,"Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in.  Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on.
"
6,7,Stan,"We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
"
6,7,Chef,"Nowww, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?
"
6,7,Stan,"We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
"
6,7,Chef,"...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?!
"
6,7,Stan,"So what should we do? 
"
6,7,Kyle,"Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
"
6,7,Cartman,"We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
"
6,7,Tweek,"Gnaaahahahah!  I pulled out my hair!
"
6,7,Butters,"Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?
"
6,7,Dougie,"...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode 204.
"
6,7,Butters,"Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
"
6,7,Dougie,"Simpsons did it!
"
6,7,Butters,"I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
"
6,7,Dougie,"Simpsons did it!
"
6,7,Stan,"This is it.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
"
6,7,Tweek,"Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... ""lookout""? I won't remember ""Hammertime""!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Ugh.  Just remember the song ""Can't Touch This"" and you'll remember the code word!
"
6,7,Stan,"Yeah, stupid.
"
6,7,Tweek,"Oh, God. 
"
6,7,Kyle,"There's nothing here! 
"
6,7,Stan,"Dude, it's probably in her stomach. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Is it her?
"
6,7,Kyle,"Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.
"
6,7,Stan,"What do we do now?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm...
"
6,7,Tweek,"Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme-  I can't remember uh-the code word!
"
6,7,Stan,"Do you see the sea people.
"
6,7,Cartman,"No, just a bunch of goo.
"
6,7,Tweek,"You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. 
"
6,7,Stan,"Yeah.
"
6,7,Tweek,"...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!
"
6,7,Stan,"Aaah!
"
6,7,Kyle,"Quick. Hide. 
"
6,7,Voice,"Yeah, well, at least we got Shannon Sharp back. 
"
6,7,Doctor 1,"Alright, let's just leave the semen sample next to the corpse; I wanna run a hair fiber test next. 
"
6,7,Doctor 2,"Hey, do you smell children?
"
6,7,Doctor 1,"No, that's not... 
"
6,7,Kyle,"Got it!
"
6,7,Stan,"Let's go! 
"
6,7,Butters,"Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
"
6,7,Dougie,"Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
"
6,7,Butters,"Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
"
6,7,Dougie,"Episode 9F17 entitled ""So It's Come To This!""
"
6,7,Butters,"Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 
"
6,7,Dougie,"...Simpsons did it.
"
6,7,Butters,"Dwaah!!
"
6,7,Cartman,"There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands. 
"
6,7,Chef,"Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand  and three hundred dollars cash . It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.
"
6,7,Cartman,"It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!
"
6,7,Chef,"...Wait, what? Sea people?
"
6,7,Stan,"The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
"
6,7,Chef,"Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.
"
6,7,Stan,"...and then we put them back in the tank.
"
6,7,Chef,"Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men.
"
6,7,Kyle,"It is?
"
6,7,Chef,"Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.
"
6,7,Chef,"Relax, children, junk that's in brine can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Oh, really?? 
"
6,7,Tweek,"Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah!
"
6,7,Chef,"Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people.  Come on, children. I'll walk you all home. 
"
6,7,Stan,"Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"G'night, guys.
"
6,7,Kyle,"I'm so glad we're not murderers. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it!
"
6,7,Stan,"Oh no, what now? 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! 
"
6,7,Kyle,"Whoa. 
"
6,7,Stan,"Wow. How did that happen?
"
6,7,Cartman,"I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Whoa.
"
6,7,Stan,"They've already accomplished so much.
"
6,7,Tweek,"They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.
"
6,7,Cartman,"That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!
"
6,7,Tweek,"Hr!
"
6,7,Cartman,"You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Well what are you gonna do?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
"
6,7,Butters,"I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
"
6,7,Dougie,"No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that.
"
6,7,Butters,"Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
"
6,7,Announcer,"Tonight on the Simpsons: It's a laughorama when Bart builds a machine that takes cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace them instead, with mayonnaise.
"
6,7,Butters,"Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.
"
6,7,Dougie,"Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! 
"
6,7,Butters,"No! No! 
"
6,7,Dougie,"Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
"
6,7,Butters,"Aaaaah!
"
6,7,Dougie,"Don't have a cow, man.
"
6,7,Butters,"Oh sweet Jesus!
"
6,7,Woman,"Can I help you?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?
"
6,7,Woman,"Your... mom told you?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Do you have them or not?
"
6,7,Woman,"We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.
"
6,7,Cartman,"What's your name?
"
6,7,Woman,"Frances Velman.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? 
"
6,7,Woman,"Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce.  One donor, certified, on record.
"
6,7,Cartman,"I see, very interesting. 
"
6,7,Frances,"What are you doing?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
"
6,7,Frances,"Five? Vials?
"
6,7,Cartman,"No, gallons.
"
6,7,Frances,"Www-we don't have that much here.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Damint! Give me all you've got, then! 
"
6,7,Butters,"Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!
"
6,7,Dougie,"Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!! 
"
6,7,Butters,"Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 
"
6,7,Ms. Crabtree,"SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!
"
6,7,Butters,"Haaah! 
"
6,7,Mr. Garrison,"Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat?
"
6,7,Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
6,7,Butters,"Aaah! Nooo! 
"
6,7,Mr. Garrison,"...What the hell's wrong with him?
"
6,7,Stan,"Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
"
6,7,Tweek,"Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.
"
6,7,Cartman,"That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?
"
6,7,Tweek,"Uh-uh huh.
"
6,7,Stan,"Well, drop them in! 
"
6,7,Cartman,"And I've got the sea men. 
"
6,7,Kyle,"Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
"
6,7,Stan,"That's cool.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go. 
"
6,7,Stan,"Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Nothin' to do now but wait.
"
6,7,Stan,"...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
"
6,7,Stan,"Hm.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Huh.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!
"
6,7,Liane,"That's nice, poopie. 
"
6,7,News Anchor,"And in other South Park News, elementary school teacher Ms. Choksondik's  autopsy has shown that the semen in her stomach belongs to school counselor, Mr. Mackey.  However, the semen apparently did NOT contribute to the death, and so Mr. Mackey's identity is to remain anonymous. 
"
6,7,"Stan, Kyle","Hey Butters.
"
6,7,Butters,"Haaa!
"
6,7,Stan,"Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
"
6,7,Butters,"Cartman?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Ha ha! 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
"
6,7,Mr. Garrison,"That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?
"
6,7,Cartman,"I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
"
6,7,Butters,"Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!
"
6,7,Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
"
6,7,Butters,"They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
"
6,7,Cartman,"...So?
"
6,7,Kyle,"...Yeah. So?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
"
6,7,Stan,"Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
"
6,7,Mr. Garrison,"Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.
"
6,7,Chef,"Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode.
"
6,7,Butters,"Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
"
6,7,Chef,"Good for you!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
"
6,7,Butters,"I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 
"
6,7,Stan,"Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! 
"
6,7,Kyle,"Hey! It's Tweek.
"
6,7,Tweek,"Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.
"
6,7,Cartman,"That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! 
"
6,7,Mr. Garrison,"What's going on now?
"
6,7,Kyle,"The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
"
6,7,Tweek,"Gaaa-hah!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Yeah! Go! 
"
6,7,Tweek,"NOW what's happening?
"
6,7,Stan,"The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Oh God-damnit! 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Oh no! Oh the humanity!
"
6,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Why can't societies just live in peace?
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Parents, it's that time of year again when the bishops and priests from around the country are organizing the Young Men's Catholic Retreat. This year, we're taking the boys on a weekend boat trip to discuss Jesus's role as the Navigator of our lives.
"
6,8,Stan,"That sounds pretty fun.
"
6,8,Randy,"A Catholic boat trip? 
"
6,8,Singer,"The Catholic Boat's gonna be headin' on out today.
The Catholic Boat. Time to throw all of your cares away.
Get some hot Christian action; it'll make you-
"
6,8,Randy,"Waaah! Waaah!  Uyah  ahem. 'Scuse me.
"
6,8,Randy,"Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.
"
6,8,Richard,"We can let them go, can we?
"
6,8,Linda,"There's no way my son's going.
"
6,8,Stan,"What are they talking about?
"
6,8,Cartman,"I don't know.
"
6,8,Tweek,"Maybe they wanna kill us.
"
6,8,Randy,"With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.
"
6,8,Stuart,"Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters.
"
6,8,Richard,"Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; your son's dead. But those of us with alive children need to be sure that Father Maxi's on the up-and-up.
"
6,8,Sharon,"I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.
"
6,8,Randy,"It couldn't hurt.
"
6,8,Richard,"Uh, Sh-sh. Here he comes, here he comes. 
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Uh... Good-bye, everyone.
"
6,8,All,"Good-bye, Father. 
"
6,8,Stephen,"Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth.
"
6,8,Counselor,"Hi boys. My name is Ms. Gorache and I need to ask you a few questions about your priest, okaaay?
"
6,8,Boys,"Okay.
"
6,8,Counselor,"Okay. Would you say that Father Maxi is... nice? Or mean?
"
6,8,Boys,"Nice.
"
6,8,Stan,"Um, cool.
"
6,8,Counselor,"Okaaay, what words would you use to describe your priest? 
"
6,8,Butters,"Compassionate.
"
6,8,Counselor,"Okay. And did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt? 
"
6,8,Cartman,"Ih... in our... butt?
"
6,8,Counselor,"You don't need to be ashamed or embarrassed. Just, did he ever try to put anything in your butt?
"
6,8,Stan,"...Like ...money? What?
"
6,8,Butters,"You mean, like a goldfish?
"
6,8,Counselor,"No, no. Did he ever try to put anything that belonged to him in your butt?
"
6,8,Boys,"No.
"
6,8,Thomas,"This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids.
"
6,8,Man,"Yeah, what has Catholicism come to anyway?
"
6,8,Randy,"You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!
"
6,8,Richard,"That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too.
"
6,8,Linda,"Let's all be atheists!
"
6,8,All,"Yeah, yeah, alright.
"
6,8,Man,"If there was a god, why would he let our kids be molested in the first place?
"
6,8,Stephen,"Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!
"
6,8,Randy,"Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists.
"
6,8,Stephen,"...Same thing.
"
6,8,Randy,"Yeah! 
"
6,8,Stan,"What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 
"
6,8,Cartman,"Maybe... No.
"
6,8,Kyle,"Hey dudes.
"
6,8,"Stan, Cartman","Hey.
"
6,8,Tweek,"Arr!
"
6,8,Kyle,"What are you guys doin'?
"
6,8,Stan,"We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts.
"
6,8,Kyle,"In your butts?
"
6,8,Cartman,"Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
"
6,8,Kyle,"Why would he put anything in your butts?
"
6,8,Stan,"We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
"
6,8,Cartman,"Hm.
"
6,8,Kyle,"Hm. 
"
6,8,Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
6,8,Stan,"Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
"
6,8,Chef,"Good-bah! 
"
6,8,Tweek,"Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!
"
6,8,Kyle,"Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
"
6,8,Cartman,"Aw, dude, I think I might have it.
"
6,8,Stan,"What?
"
6,8,Cartman,"It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?
"
6,8,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
6,8,Cartman,"Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?
"
6,8,Kyle,"Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
"
6,8,Cartman,"What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
"
6,8,Kyle,"It wouldn't work!
"
6,8,Cartman,"Have you ever tried it?
"
6,8,Kyle,"I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
"
6,8,Cartman,"I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
"
6,8,Kyle,"You're on, fat boy!
"
6,8,Cartman,"Okay, let's go, Jew! 
"
6,8,Parents,"Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!
"
6,8,Randy,"Stan, you're an atheist now!
"
6,8,Richard,"You too, Tweek!
"
6,8,Parents,"Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!
"
6,8,Tweek,"I'm a what??
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Fathers, I want to thank you all for coming.
"
6,8,Priest 1,"No, thank you for finally organizing an all-priests meeting, Father Maxi. I think we all agree something has to be done, quickly. 
"
6,8,Elderly Priest,"Well, I don't know how it's been for all of you, but attendance at my church in Fort Rawlins is down sixty-three percent! 
"
6,8,Priest 2,"I'm down almost seventy in Greenleaf.
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Uh-yes, uh, I'm afraid if things keep going the way they are, we could lose our entire religion.
"
6,8,Elderly Priest,"Yes, we've gotta stop these boys from goin' to the public!
"
6,8,Fat Priest,"They've gotta know to keep their mouths shut!
"
6,8,Other priests,"That right, yeah.
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Right, and so... wa- wait a minute. What?
"
6,8,Priest 1,"Yes, but we've got to find out why these children are suddenly finding it necessary to report that they're being molested. Stop the problem at its source.
"
6,8,Priest 2,"Yes, but how?
"
6,8,Priest 3,"Something has to be done.
"
6,8,Priest 4,"We've got to stop this-
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Whoa, whoa, hold on a second! The problem is that children are being molested, not that they're reporting it! 
"
6,8,Elderly Priest,"How do you mean?
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Well, I mean, obviously, what we need to put a stop to is all the sexual misconduct that is allowed to take place in our churches, and not just tell the children not to tell anybody about it. I mean, right?
"
6,8,Priest 1,"Well did any of the children you've molested come forward?
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"No.
"
6,8,Priest 1,"Well, that's good.
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"No, I mean! I've never molested any of the children in my church!
"
6,8,Elderly Priest,"Hih-it's okay, Father Maxi. We're all priests here; the doors are closed.
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Oh for the love of God! Are you all saying that you've engaged in inappropriate relations with your altar boys? We are here to bring the light of God, not harm the innocent!  I'm serious!
"
6,8,Priest 2,"Father, uh, having sex with boys is part of the Catholic priest's way of life.
"
6,8,Other priests,"Yeah. 
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Dear God. This problem is much more severe than I could have possibly imagined. I have to go to the Vatican and get help.
"
6,8,Kyle,"Well, Cartman?
"
6,8,Cartman,"Hold on!  God, let a man crap!
"
6,8,Craig,"What's going on?
"
6,8,Stan,"Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
"
6,8,Craig,"Oh. 
"
6,8,Kyle,"Well, go on, smartass, and do it!
"
6,8,Cartman,"I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!
"
6,8,Stan,"You've had five, dude!
"
6,8,Cartman,"I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.
"
6,8,Kyle,"No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
"
6,8,Cartman,"Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. 
"
6,8,Kyle,"Get the fuck out of here!
"
6,8,Cartman,"Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!  You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Well, there you go. Um, grazie.  Wow, I'm actually here. Vatican City! 
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Your Holiness, this is Father Maxi from America. He has brought this all to our attention.
"
6,8,Father Maxi,"Your Holiness. 
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Adoramus te, Christe.
"
6,8,Other Cardinals,"Et dominus...
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Cardinals, bishops, and priests, an American priest by the name of-a Maxi has brought to our attention the most troubling of news. All over his-a country there are reports of children being molested by men of the Church. If things continue this way, we'll never be able to have sex with young boys again! 
"
6,8,Father Maxi,"That's right-wait. What?
"
6,8,French Cardinal,"In France as well we are finding it harder and harder to... make love to our boys.
"
6,8,Moroccan Cardinal,"In Morocco they have arrested five of my priests. It's only a matter of time before they get the rest of us.
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Father Maxi, what do you suggest we do to not get caught.
"
6,8,Father Maxi,"Not get caught? NO!! I, I think what we should do is not have sex with boys! 
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"It is not written anywhere in the Holy Document of Vatican Law that sex with-a boys is wrong..
"
6,8,Father Maxi,"Well, maybe we need to change the Holy Document of Vatican Law. 
"
6,8,British Cardinal,"Speaking on behalf of the British Catholics, it is obvious that the priest doesn't realize that the Holy Document of Vatican Law can not be changed!
"
6,8,The Clergy,"Yeah! It cannot be changed! Yeah!
"
6,8,Gelgamek Cardinal,"Yes, and speaking on behalf of the Gelgamek Catholics, I believe we should move on to other solutions to this problem.  
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Gelgameks?
"
6,8,Cartman,"Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. 
"
6,8,Kyle,"What?
"
6,8,Cartman,"It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- 
"
6,8,Randy,"Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.
"
6,8,Sharon,"That's right, everyone just dig in.  So, kids,anything happen with your whole Sunday off?
"
6,8,Stan,"Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
"
6,8,Sharon,"Stanley! 
"
6,8,Stan,"What? He did.
"
6,8,Randy,"Noho, it doesn't work that way, son.
"
6,8,Stan,"Yeah it does.
"
6,8,Randy,"No it doesn't.
"
6,8,Stan,"Yeah. It does. 
"
6,8,Randy,"Honey! Honey, come quick!
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Look, people! I'm just trying to say that if we don't change the Holy Document of Vatican Law, then we might lose everyone to atheism!
"
6,8,French Cardinal,"What exactly do you suggest we change, Father Maxi.
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Well, for one, no sex with boys. 
"
6,8,Another Cardinal,"The Holy Document of Vatican Law states that a priest, bishop, or cardinal cannot get married, so where are we to get our sex?
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Uh well then, perhaps we could change the Holy Document of Vatican Law to say that... it's okay for a priest or bishop or cardinal to have sex... with women. 
"
6,8,French Cardinal,"Women?
"
6,8,Gelgamek Cardinal,"The Gelgamek vagina is three feet wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth. Do you really expect us to have sex with them?!
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Wuh- okay, m-maybe we just need to forget about the Gelgameks for a second and focus-
"
6,8,Gelgamek Cardinal,"What's that about the Gelgameks?! 
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"I'm just saying, what works on planet Gelgamek isn't necessarily goin' ta work for the rest of us here, on Earth. You see? That's the problem we're having here.
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"But-a the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed!
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Why not?!
"
6,8,Another Cardinal,"Because we don't know where it is.
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"You see, Father, the Holy Document of Vatican Law has been hidden away deep in the Catacombs of-a St. Peter's below us. Hidden away so that it can never be changed.
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"But if we locate it we can make changes to it?
"
6,8,A bishop,"HA! Good luck, father! The document is guarded by water lizards, rattlesnakes and sand traps! The fools who have tried before to recover it met their deaths!
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Well we have to try. Our religion is dying!
"
6,8,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! Look! 
"
6,8,Tweek,"Harrr!
"
6,8,Cartman,"I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
"
6,8,Stan,"So?
"
6,8,Cartman,"So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!
"
6,8,Kyle,"Go fuck yourself, Cartman!
"
6,8,Cartman,"Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.
"
6,8,Kyle,"Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
"
6,8,Cartman,"Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.
"
6,8,Kyle,"So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! 
"
6,8,Stan,"Dude, look.
"
6,8,News Anchor,"Our top story tonight, the age-old question has been answered: if I put food up my ass, will I crap out my mouth? All over the country, people are discovering that, yes, in fact, you will.  The surgeon-general had this to say:
"
6,8,Surgeon-General,"And the uh immediate research shows that the act is not only amusing, but in fact much healthier for out bodies than the old way of eating.  You see, food entering through the anus has the benefit of being broken down on its way to the stomach rather than afterward. And therefore I believe that interorectogestion would actually put a stop to high cholesterol and most kinds of stomach cancers. And I base that on absolutely nothing.
"
6,8,News Anchor,"The Surgeon-General's response has made Americans change their eating habits almost instantly.
"
6,8,Cartman,"That's stupid and immature, Cartman!
"
6,8,Kyle,"It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!
"
6,8,News Anchor,"The Mayor of South Park has announced that for first discovering this healthy way of eating, young citizen   Eric Cartman will be given... a freaking medal.
"
6,8,Kyle,"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
6,8,Announcer,"Now, with more on ""Martha Stewart's Living"" .
"
6,8,Martha Stewart,"In the past few days we've all heard of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion, and so making food that can be inserted into the ass is essential.  Now, everyone knows that some foods are simple to shove up the ass - puddings, soups, raisins... this is a nice raisin pudding right here - but we can also still eat our favorite foods. What we're gonna do today is prepare a Thanksgiving turkey for interorecto.  Now, the key to shoving a turkey up your ass is first wrapping it in string, keeping the pointy wings neatly at the side. 
"
6,8,FBI agent,"Ms. Stewart, we have some questions.
"
6,8,Martha Stewart,"Not right now, I just wanna focus on my turkey,  right now.  Now, we're going to baste the turkey with lubricating gel rather than with juice - this'll help smooth the insertion later on. We still bake at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes a pound.  When it's done we'll get something like this.  So now we're ready to go. Looks delicious. Let's try it out.  Aaaaa-... Yeah, get it up there. Yeah. AAAA. Yeeaahhhh.  Phew. And that is how you eat a turkey.  We'll be right back with more. 
"
6,8,Old Monk,"Beoo!
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Ahh, hello. Uh- My name is Father Maxi, from the United States.
"
6,8,Old Monk,"What do you seek, Father?
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make revisions to it.
"
6,8,Old Monk,"That Gospel...  lies somewhere beyond this door.  But... many troubles await thee inside! Only he whose heart truly belongs to the Lord shalla make it through.
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"I have to try. Our religion is in trouble, and... and that scroll may be our only hope!
"
6,8,Old Monk,"Then, prepare yourself. The time of trials begins.  Adoramus te, Christe!  I wish you luck, Father. Use all the strength, agility, and faith that you have.
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Very well. Here we go.  Hmmm, there's a ladder up here.  Oh my God, a rattlesnake!  A way back up!  I've made it! Praise be to God! He hath shown me the way!  This must be it. The Holy Document of Vatican Law. 
"
6,8,Randy,"Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. 
"
6,8,Linda,"Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?
"
6,8,Richard,"Atheism has definitely made our lives better.
"
6,8,Sharon,"I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some.
"
6,8,All,"Ooohh.
"
6,8,Sharon,"And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here. 
"
6,8,Richard,"Oh thanks, Sharon.
"
6,8,Man,"You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're worried we might have a hard time raising our son atheist. I mean-  whoa, thank you -I mean,  it could end up being very difficult raising an atheist child in such a Christian society.  I feel that everywhere my poor son goes he's being persecuted for his beliefs. 
"
6,8,Richard,"That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don't want him saying ""under God"" every day at school. That could really damage him. ""Under God"" should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse me.  Moowwaaagh.  ""Under God"" should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance.
"
6,8,Randy,"That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.
"
6,8,All,"That's right, that's right.
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Cardinals, bishops and priests! Father Maxi has returned! And he has the Holy Document of-a Vatican Law! 
"
6,8,British Cardinal,"How did he make it past the water lizards?
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Yes, I have returned with the Holy Document of Vatican Law, so can we PLEASE, change  it now to say, ""It's NOT okay to have sex with boys""? 
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Wait wait-a, the pope-a wants-a to say something.  The pope-a says we shall ask the highest source. 
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Oh my. 
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"The holy one!  Behold the great Queen Spider! 
"
6,8,The Clergy,"Hail Queen Spider!
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Queen spider?
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"O great Queen Spider, we seek a-your guidance.
"
6,8,Queen Spider,"What do you ask of me?
"
6,8,British Cardinal,"Great Queen Spider, we seek to change one of the Vatican rules.
"
6,8,Queen Spider,"The Vatican rules cannot be changed. So saith the Spider
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Go on, Priest Maxi. See if you can convince her.
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Alright, that does it!!! I've had enough!!! You people have completely lost touch with the outside world! You sit in this big room with your Gelgameks and your Queen Spider, and none of it applies to what being a Catholic is all about!!
"
6,8,A bishop,"But the Holy Document of Vatican Law states that-
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"To hell with the Holy Document of Vatican Law!! 
"
6,8,Cartman,"You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!
"
6,8,Kyle,"So?
"
6,8,Cartman,"So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. 
"
6,8,Kyle,"Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
"
6,8,Cartman,"O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
"
6,8,Kyle,"You were totally, one hundred percent right.
"
6,8,Cartman,"Heh...  what?
"
6,8,Kyle,"You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
"
6,8,Cartman,"You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! 
"
6,8,A man,"Yeah, the pope is gone!
"
6,8,Randy,"Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!
"
6,8,Linda,"Score one for us atheists
"
6,8,Richard,"Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it on TV! 
"
6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Gone! It's all gone!
"
6,8,British Cardinal,"Well, thanks a lot, Father Maxi. You've killed our religion.
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"No I didn't! All that's dead are your stupid laws and rules!  You've forgotten what being a Catholic is all about.  This... book. You see, these are just stories.  Stories that are meant to help people in the right direction. Love your neighbor. Be a good person.  That's it! And when you start turning the stories into literal translations of hierarchies and power, well... Well, you end up with this.  People are losing faith because they don't see how what you've turned the religion into applies to them! They've lost touch with any idea of any kind of religion, and when they have no mythology to try and live their lives by, well, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths! 
"
6,8,Richard,"...What was that last bit?
"
6,8,Priest Maxi,"Look, I, I'm proud to be a Catholic. But I'm a Catholic in the real world. In today's world! It's time for you all to do that, too. It is time... for change.
"
6,8,Randy,"He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.
"
6,8,Sharon,"O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.
"
6,8,Randy,"Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.
"
6,8,Stan,"Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
"
6,8,Randy,"No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. 
"
6,9,Stan,"Oh, cool. A preview. 
"
6,9,Announcer,"Coming this summer , it's the classic film that changed America. E.T.: The Extraterrestrial, the new, redone version for 2002.  All the E.T. effects have been digitally upgraded.  All the guns have been digitally changed to walkie-talkies. And the word ""TERRORIST"" has been changed to ""HIPPIE.""
"
6,9,Stan,"Aw, dude, why would they do that?
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
"
6,9,Kyle,"No, dude. They only changed ""terrorist"" to ""hippie"" to make E.T. more P.C.
"
6,9,Stan,"That's gay. 
"
6,9,Announcer,"Coming this summer, it's the motion picture that changed America. Saving Private Ryan, the RE-RE-RELEASE, where the word ""NAZI"" has been changed to ""PERSONS WITH POLITICAL DIFFERENCES,"" and all their guns have been replaced by walkie-talkies. 
"
6,9,Stan,"Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
"
6,9,Announcer,"And now, for your feature presentation: the classic RE-RE-RE-RELEASE of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back
"
6,9,The Boys,"Woohoo!
"
6,9,Announcer,"In the version, the word ""WOOKIE"" has been changed to ""HAIR CHALLENGED ANIMAL"" and the entire cast has been digitally replaced by Ewoks.
"
6,9,The Boys,"AWWWW!!! 
"
6,9,Stan,"Goddamnit, that pissed me off!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah, we want our money back!
"
6,9,Shlomo,"Sorry, suckers! 
"
6,9,Cartman,"You asshole! 
"
6,9,Kyle,"Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
"
6,9,Tweek,"Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.
"
6,9,Stan,"Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.
"
6,9,Stan,"We have to do something. Let's form a club.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
"
6,9,Stan,"No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Yeah. We'll be the ""Save Films From Their Own Directors"" club
"
6,9,"Cartman, Stan","Yeah
"
6,9,Tweek,"NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!
"
6,9,Tweek,"I'm not! I'm not a team player!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!
"
6,9,Tweek,"D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!
"
6,9,Stan,"Well what's wrong with it?
"
6,9,Cartman,"Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. 
"
6,9,Kyle,"""Free hat?""
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
"
6,9,Tweek,"But we don't have hats!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Well we can just make them out of paper.
"
6,9,Tweek,"Aahh!
"
6,9,Cartman,"It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
"
6,9,Tweek,"You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??
"
6,9,Stan,"Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 
"
6,9,Tweek,"Fifty hats? Oh Jesus! 
"
6,9,Tweek,"Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it! 
"
6,9,Richard,"Tweek!
"
6,9,Tweek,"Hrrr!
"
6,9,Richard,"Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center.
"
6,9,Tweek,"My center. My... center.  Calm  Cup? 
"
6,9,Cartman,"Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!
"
6,9,Tweek,"Gaaaaah!
"
6,9,Cartman,"How many hats have you made?
"
6,9,Tweek,"Oh God!
"
6,9,Cartman,"We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!
"
6,9,Tweek,"Aaaah! Oh God! 
"
6,9,Tweek,"You guys, we have a big problem!
"
6,9,Stan,"What?
"
6,9,Tweek,"I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.
"
6,9,Stan,"Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
"
6,9,Tweek,"A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!
"
6,9,Tweek,"Goohoo!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.
"
6,9,Crowd,"Free hat!  Free hat! Free hat!
"
6,9,Tweek,"Oh God!
"
6,9,Cartman,"I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.
"
6,9,Crowd,"Free hat! Free hat!
"
6,9,Tweek,"I gotta move away, you guys!
"
6,9,Stan,"Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
"
6,9,Stan,"Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
"
6,9,Crowd,"Yeah! Yeah!
"
6,9,Stan,"Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 
"
6,9,Skeeter,"Eh- Excuse me?
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.
"
6,9,Tweek,"Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!
"
6,9,Woman,"We don't care about that.
"
6,9,Tweek,"You don't?
"
6,9,Stan,"You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
"
6,9,Skeeter,"Yeah. Free Hat.
"
6,9,Tweek,"What?
"
6,9,Man,"Hat McCollough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released!
"
6,9,Man 2,"Yeah!
"
6,9,Crowd,"Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
"
6,9,Stan,"Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 
"
6,9,Man,"To do what?
"
6,9,Kyle,"We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
"
6,9,Skeeter,"Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place. 
"
6,9,Crowd,"Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
"
6,9,Stan,"Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
"
6,9,Skeeter,"Can't we also work towards freeing Hat?
"
6,9,Stan,"Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
"
6,9,Some people,"Oh yeeaahhh!! Raaaaah!! Woohoo!!
"
6,9,Crowd,"Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
"
6,9,Stan,"...212, 213, 214 members!
"
6,9,Tweek,"You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!
"
6,9,Kyle,"What?
"
6,9,Tweek,"Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.
"
6,9,Stan,"Really? That's great.
"
6,9,Kyle,"Yah.
"
6,9,Tweek,"No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!
"
6,9,Stan,"If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
"
6,9,Cartman,"But just remember that I do all the talking.
"
6,9,Kyle,"You?? Why?
"
6,9,Cartman,"Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
"
6,9,Stan,"When did we do dibs for it?
"
6,9,Cartman,"Just now -  1 2 3 dibs! 
"
6,9,Kyle,"Me.
"
6,9,Tweek,"Ga-ahah!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
"
6,9,Cartman,"What could possibly go wrong?
"
6,9,Ted Koppel,"A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCollough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCollough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?
"
6,9,Cartman,"...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. 
"
6,9,Tweek,"Gaaarh!
"
6,9,Ted Koppel,"Well, Hat McCollough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free?
"
6,9,Tweek,"Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah!
"
6,9,Ted Koppel,"Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as ""positive"" about toddler murder?
"
6,9,Tweek,"Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?
"
6,9,Ted Koppel,"Yes... It is easy.  Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status?
"
6,9,Kyle,"We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
"
6,9,Ted Koppel,"Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because joining us now are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. 
"
6,9,Tweek,"Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Hello, Ted.
"
6,9,George Lucas,"Oh hi, Ted.
"
6,9,Ted Koppel,"Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response?
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers.
"
6,9,George Lucas,"You're here.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. 
"
6,9,Tweek,"Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children.
"
6,9,Kyle,"Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah, we're children.
"
6,9,Stan,"Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
"
6,9,Ted Koppel,"How so?
"
6,9,Cartman,"Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
"
6,9,George Lucas,"I'm not a Jew! 
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ewver did.
"
6,9,Kyle,"Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Wait a minute. What'd you say?
"
6,9,George Lucas,"Eh, that's brilliant!
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Yes. Change Raiders of the Lost Ark! Why didn't we think of it before?!
"
6,9,Kyle,"No. NOO!!
"
6,9,Stan,"Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 
"
6,9,Cartman,"Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.
"
6,9,Man 3,"And if we get a hold ot the negative they can't change the movie?
"
6,9,Stan,"That is our understanding.
"
6,9,Woman,"Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
"
6,9,Crowd,"YEAH!
"
6,9,Skeeter,"Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free!
"
6,9,Crowd,"YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Nonono! We need to do this first.
"
6,9,Woman,"But we have to free Hat.
"
6,9,Stan,"It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
"
6,9,Man 4,"Well yeah, but it was in self-defense!
"
6,9,Crowd,"YEAH!
"
6,9,Cartman,"He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
"
6,9,Skeeter,"Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha.
"
6,9,Man 5,"Three eyewitnesses testified that if Hat hadn't killed those babies, they'd have killed him!
"
6,9,Crowd,"YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
"
6,9,Stan,"Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
"
6,9,Skeeter,"He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat.
"
6,9,Crowd,"YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
"
6,9,Stan,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
"
6,9,Tweek,"No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! 
"
6,9,Kyle,"We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
"
6,9,Tweek,"Hwaaah!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.
"
6,9,Tweek,"Haaah!
"
6,9,Cartman,"People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
"
6,9,Stan,"Okay, go. 
"
6,9,Tweek,"I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! 
"
6,9,Kyle,"This looks like the right room.
"
6,9,Tweek,"I'm in a field... surrounded by deer.
"
6,9,Stan,"Over here! 
"
6,9,Kyle,"That's it!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!
"
6,9,Tweek,"Huh uh.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!
"
6,9,Tweek,"Guh huh huh! 
"
6,9,George Lucas,"What are you doing?! 
"
6,9,Tweek,"Oh God! Oh Jesus!
"
6,9,George Lucas,"You're the boys from that ...stupid club. Give me that! 
"
6,9,Tweek,"Aaaaaah!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
"
6,9,George Lucas,"We're gonna make it better. The movie's gonna be changed, and that's that!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
"
6,9,Stan,"Aw, really?
"
6,9,Tweek,"Oh God, no! Not Plan B! 
"
6,9,Cartman,"You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? 
"
6,9,George Lucas,"...What??
"
6,9,Cartman,"Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-
"
6,9,Stan,"Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
"
6,9,Cartman,"...No, he has an icy heart.
"
6,9,Kyle,"...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.
"
6,9,Stan,"So we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song
"
6,9,Cartman,"It's a cool island song.
"
6,9,Kyle,"Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Oh, do we wanna do that?
"
6,9,George Lucas,"ALRIGHT, that does it!
"
6,9,George Lucas,"Yes, thank you, officer.  The police are on their way, boys.  Soon you'll be in jail getting RAMMED!
"
6,9,Tweek,"Aaaahh!
"
6,9,Stan,"Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 
"
6,9,Kyle,"It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. 
"
6,9,George Lucas,"It is... too late for me, boys.
"
6,9,Kyle,"You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
"
6,9,George Lucas,"M-that's different. These are my movies. I made them, and I have the right to do whatever I want with them
"
6,9,Stan,"You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
"
6,9,Kyle,"When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society
"
6,9,George Lucas,"Have I... become so old that I've forgetten what being an artist is about?
"
6,9,Stan,"Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
"
6,9,George Lucas,"Perhaps... you are right. 
"
6,9,A Voice,"STOP!  What are you doing, George?!
"
6,9,George Lucas,"Steven, Uh, I-
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Give me that print, George! We need to make the alterations!
"
6,9,George Lucas,"Steven, these boys had a point. I don't remember what it was, but it was good.
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"You haven't let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment, have you, George?!  Don't forget: you belong to me.
"
6,9,Kyle,"Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 
"
6,9,George Lucas,"I'm... ah I'm sorry, boys. 
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Now take the children prisoner! 
"
6,9,Kyle,"What??
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"You troublemakers shall be my guests of honor at the premiere of the NEW Raiders of the Lost Ark! Your gay little club is over!
"
6,9,Stan,"Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! 
"
6,9,Tweek,"Oh my God they're gonna kill us. 
"
6,9,Guard 1,"Don't even think about it, kid! I'm not afraid to use this walkie-talkie!
"
6,9,Guard 2,"The one with the cocaine-problem escaped, mein Direktor.
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Leave him!! Let him run back to his mommy!  We must get the film ready for the premiere.  Lucas! Come! 
"
6,9,Announcer,"Coming, this summer!  It's the digitally-enhanced re-release of the very first pilot episode of South Park!  Yes, the classic, rough, hand-made first episode is getting a make-over for 2002!  The simple, funny aliens are now super-badass and kewl!  Flying saucer? No longer cheap construction paper, but a 4.0 megapixel constructed through a masterpiece of technology! Everything's new! New is better!
"
6,9,Trey Parker,"When we first made South Park, we didn't wanna use construction paper. We just had to because it was cheap.
"
6,9,Matt Stone,"And now with new technology we can finally remaster South Park, make it look sharp, clean and focused.
"
6,9,Trey Parker,"Expensive. 
"
6,9,Announcer,"Yes, all the charm of a simple little cartoon  will melt before your eyes as it is replaced by newer and more standardized animation!
"
6,9,Trey Parker,"For instance, in the scene at the bus stop, we always meant to have Imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background, but simply couldn't afford it.
"
6,9,Announcer,"Get this special enhanced version quick, because another enhanced version will likely be coming out for 2003!
"
6,9,Tweek,"Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president , treasurer , and secretary  have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!
"
6,9,Man 3,"Prisoner? You mean, like Hat?
"
6,9,Tweek,"Yes, just like hat!!
"
6,9,Skeeter,"But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison? 
"
6,9,Tweek,"No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!
"
6,9,Woman,"Hey, he's got a point there.
"
6,9,Man 6,"Yeah... Maybe we could melt the governor's icy heart with a cool island song!
"
6,9,Members,"Yeah.
"
6,9,Tweek,"No!
"
6,9,Skeeter,"No?
"
6,9,Man 7,"No! He's right. We have to freeze his hot heart with a cool island song.
"
6,9,Woman,"Or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?
"
6,9,Man 8,"Let's cool his hot temper with a fresh island song.
"
6,9,Man 9,"That's it!
"
6,9,Man 10,"Let's go! Come on! 
"
6,9,Tweek,"Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!
"
6,9,Pat O'Brien,"Well, the print is finished and the day has come. Tonight, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas  will be at the premiere of the new special edition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Lots of celebrity guests and other rich people will be on hand to witness all the updated effects and modernized technology.
"
6,9,Tweek,"Hello!
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"The kid? The tweaked out kid?!
"
6,9,Tweek,"I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg! 
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Your pesistence surprises even me. 
"
6,9,Francis Ford Coppola,"Surely you don't think you can escape from this premiere.
"
6,9,Tweek,"That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Wow.
"
6,9,Tweek,"Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
"
6,9,Cartman,"AY!
"
6,9,Francis Ford Coppola,"And if we refuse?
"
6,9,Tweek,"Then your premiere has no movie!
"
6,9,Stan,"He's definitely lost it
"
6,9,Kyle,"Yup.
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Okay, okay. Stan- stand back, stand ba- stand back! Back!  Okay kid, you win.  Blow it up.  Zuroch!  Zuroch!  Blow it back to God.  All your life has been the pursuit of seeing a great film! This new version of Raiders has digital effects beyond your wildest dreams! You want to see it screened just as much as I. 
"
6,9,Kyle,"Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Son, we are simply passing through history. This... is imPROVED history.  Do as you will. 
"
6,9,Members,"In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, the air is fresh and the people are free.
"
6,9,Man 5,"But here in the mountain there's no freedom like that.
"
6,9,Skeeter,"There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. 
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Hafaa malifi! Thanks for coming, everyone.  This is the birth of the NEW version of Raiders of the Lost Ark! We shall screen it here, and then destroy all the old prints in celebration!
"
6,9,Audience,"Hooray! All right!
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Begin the film! 
"
6,9,Audience,"Whoa.
"
6,9,Stan,"You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
"
6,9,Tweek,"Ah, what?!
"
6,9,Stan,"Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! 
"
6,9,Audience,"Whoa. Ahhh.
"
6,9,Steven Spielberg,"It's beyooootiful. 
"
6,9,Viewer 1,"Wait a minute. This version is awful!
"
6,9,Viewer 2,"Yeah! They ruined it!
"
6,9,Viewer 3,"Oh my God, it's terrible! 
"
6,9,George Lucas,"AaaaAAAAA!!
"
6,9,Stan,"Yuh, you guys okay. 
"
6,9,Kyle,"Yeah. I I think so.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
"
6,9,Aide,"Today is a day of celebration, and we owe it all to these four brave young boys. 
"
6,9,Townsman,"Yeah! Alright!
"
6,9,Aide,"And thanks to the bravery of this young man in particular,  ...Hat McCollough is finally free from prison! 
"
6,9,Townsfolk,"Yeah! Woohoohoo!
"
6,9,Kyle,"...What? 
"
6,9,Townsfolk,"Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat!
"
6,9,Hat McCollough,"Thank you everyone-KILL! KILL THE INNOCENT!! Uh, I'm so thankful for all your support-RAPE THE VIRGINS!! And uh, I just wonder if i could get a baby real quick? 
"
6,9,Skeeter,"Sure. Give that man a baby!
"
6,9,Townsfolk,"Yeah! Woohoohoo! 
"
6,9,Stan,"Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. 
"
6,9,Tweek,"Oh my God!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
"
6,9,Stan,"Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
"
6,9,Cartman,"That and youth. Those guys are old.
"
6,9,Tweek,"But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?
"
6,9,Stan,"Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
"
6,10,Liane,"Oh, hello boys.
"
6,10,Stan,"Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
"
6,10,Liane,"Oh, but I thought your teacher died.
"
6,10,Kyle,"She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
"
6,10,Liane,"Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. 
"
6,10,Tweek,"Cartman likes to play with dolls?
"
6,10,Cartman,"Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from the basket.
"
6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"Oh please, mister. Please let me out of here.
"
6,10,Cartman,"It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
"
6,10,Poodle,"Bark bark bark bark!
"
6,10,Cartman,"Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
"
6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"Please, mister, let me out.
"
6,10,Cartman,"It puts the lotion back in the basket!
"
6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"I miss my Mom, mister. I wanna see my Mommy-
"
6,10,Cartman,"Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!
"
6,10,Liane,"Sweetie.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Yes Mom?
"
6,10,Liane,"You have to get ready for school
"
6,10,Cartman,"...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?
"
6,10,Liane,"Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
"
6,10,Liane,"You'll get over it, honey.
"
6,10,Cartman,"But I wanna plaaayyy.
"
6,10,Wendy,"I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? 
"
6,10,Bebe,"Hey guys.
"
6,10,Wendy,"Hey Bebe.
"
6,10,Bebe,"You guys uh,  notice anything different? 
"
6,10,Wendy,"Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs.
"
6,10,Bebe,"Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away.
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay kids, let's take our seats, m'kay?  I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?
"
6,10,Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to hide our emotions with math problems.  M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do uh, four time four, m'kay?
"
6,10,Kyle,"Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.
"
6,10,Stan,"Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
"
6,10,Kyle,"I don't know. 
"
6,10,Clyde,"Hey Token. You know, I never noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.
"
6,10,Token,"I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with.
"
6,10,Butters,"Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? 
"
6,10,Cartman,"Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
"
6,10,Craig,"I don't know. Why?
"
6,10,Cartman,"It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.
"
6,10,Craig,"Yeah. It kinda does. 
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, and so uh,  so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, six times eight? Uh, Bebe?
"
6,10,Bebe,"Oh, uh, forty-eight?
"
6,10,All the boys,"Whoa.
"
6,10,Clyde,"That is an awesome answer!
"
6,10,All the boys,"Yeah!
"
6,10,Kyle,"Dude! Bebe is really smart!
"
6,10,Stan,"Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Yeah, may be.
"
6,10,Wendy,"...And I was like, ""I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars."" 
"
6,10,Stan,"Ah, hey, Bebe.
"
6,10,Bebe,"Yeah?
"
6,10,Stan,"Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
"
6,10,Bebe,"Really?  I've never done that before.
"
6,10,Butters,"Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
"
6,10,Kyle,"Yeah, it's cool.
"
6,10,Bebe,"Why sure, that sounds hellafun.
"
6,10,The boys,"Hahahahahaha...
"
6,10,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
6,10,Stan,"Hellafun
"
6,10,Cartman,"Right, heh.
"
6,10,Clyde,"Wow, hellafun. That's awesome.
"
6,10,Token,"I'm gonna start saying that now.
"
6,10,Stan,"Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe.
"
6,10,Wendy,"Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys.
"
6,10,Stan,"That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 
"
6,10,Kyle,"Yeah. She's really cool. 
"
6,10,Clyde,"It's weird how we never noticed before. 
"
6,10,Stan,"So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. 
"
6,10,Driver,"You damn kids!
"
6,10,Bebe,"Cool.
"
6,10,Clyde,"You try it, Bebe.
"
6,10,Bebe,"Okay.
"
6,10,Token,"Here comes a sedan. 
"
6,10,Driver,"You damn kids!
"
6,10,The boys,"Awesome!
"
6,10,Butters,"Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
"
6,10,Kyle,"That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-
"
6,10,Clyde,"Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-
"
6,10,Kyle,"I'm showing her.
"
6,10,Clyde,"Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-
"
6,10,Kyle,"Hoh!
"
6,10,Clyde,"Hoh hoh hoh! 
"
6,10,Kyle,"Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-
"
6,10,Stan,"Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
"
6,10,Kyle,"Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! 
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh hoh hoh!
"
6,10,Kyle,"Hah hah hah!
"
6,10,Craig,"Urh urh urh! 
"
6,10,Bebe,"Uh. Listen guys, uh, It's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. 
"
6,10,Stan,"...Wait, what were we doing again?
"
6,10,Kyle,"We were throwing rocks at cars.
"
6,10,The boys,"Oh yeah.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Woohoo.
"
6,10,Butters,"Uh here comes an SUV. 
"
6,10,Jimbo,"You damn kids!
"
6,10,The boys,"Hi, Bebe.
"
6,10,Bebe,"Hey everybody.
"
6,10,Wendy,"Oh, for Christ's sake!
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. Kids, I asked you to write a paper to read aloud for the class. Now, who want to start?  M'kay, class.
"
6,10,Clyde,"My paper is called, ""Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever.""
"
6,10,Stan,"Hey, that's what I wrote about!
"
6,10,Butters,"Me too!
"
6,10,Clyde,"Hoh!
"
6,10,Stan,"Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.
"
6,10,Clyde,"""My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end."" 
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Token, why don't you read your paper?
"
6,10,Token,"""If I could be Bebe.""  ""If I was Bebe I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went.""
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, interesting, Token, Uh... Who would like to go next?  Uh how about someone who didn't write about how cool Bebe is?
"
6,10,The boys,"Oh. 
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, Bebe?
"
6,10,Bebe,"""My cat Thumper.""
"
6,10,The boys,"Wwooww.
"
6,10,Bebe,"""Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail. 
"
6,10,Clyde,"Chase his tail? That must be so funny?
"
6,10,Bebe,"""Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end.""
"
6,10,The boys,"Wwooww!
"
6,10,Cartman,"God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
"
6,10,Craig,"That's true, huh? Man, that makes me really reflect on my pet.
"
6,10,Stan,"That's such a great paper! 
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper?
"
6,10,Wendy,"""The new Cold War""
"
6,10,Cartman,"Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! 
"
6,10,Wendy,"But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-
"
6,10,Clyde,"Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?
"
6,10,Wendy,"No!
"
6,10,Kyle,"Maybe she's in the lunch line.
"
6,10,The boys,"Yeah.
"
6,10,Wendy,"Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.
"
6,10,Millie,"I can't stand her anymore! She's such a slut!
"
6,10,Esther,"She's a total slut!
"
6,10,Red,"You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.
"
6,10,Millie,"I heard that she lifted her shirt to the boys at the bus stop.
"
6,10,Wendy,"I heard that her asshole is this big around. 
"
6,10,Bebe,"Hey guys.
"
6,10,Wendy,"Oh, hey Bebe.  Slut.  Slut.
"
6,10,Millie,"Slut.
"
6,10,Esther,"Slut.
"
6,10,Millie,"Slut.
"
6,10,Bebe,"...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?
"
6,10,Wendy,"Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner.  Slut.  Slut.
"
6,10,Millie,"Slut.
"
6,10,Esther,"Slut.
"
6,10,Red,"Slut.
"
6,10,Wendy,"Slut.
"
6,10,Millie,"Slut. 
"
6,10,Girls,"Whore. Slut. Slut.
"
6,10,Bebe's Mom,"Bebe, is something the matter?
"
6,10,Bebe,"Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today.  They called me a slut, with a huge gaping vagina.
"
6,10,Bebe's Mom,"Oh, sweetie. You're all just growing up.  Part of being a woman is having a friend one day and calling her a slut the next.
"
6,10,Bebe,"But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool.
"
6,10,Bebe,"I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family.
"
6,10,Bebe,"Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, anyways.
"
6,10,Tweek,"You... guys wanted me to meet you here?
"
6,10,Cartman,"Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk
"
6,10,Tweek,"Oh God.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.
"
6,10,"Stan, Kyle","True.
"
6,10,Stan,"Yeah.
"
6,10,Kyle,"Yep.
"
6,10,Cartman,"And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
"
6,10,Kyle,"Right.
"
6,10,Stan,"Uh huh.
"
6,10,Cartman,"And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
"
6,10,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
6,10,Stan,"That would be best.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
"
6,10,Kyle,"Huh??
"
6,10,Stan,"Kyle??
"
6,10,Cartman,"And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. 
"
6,10,Kyle,"Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
"
6,10,Cartman,"And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
"
6,10,Stan,"Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!
"
6,10,Cartman,"Pleeeeease???
"
6,10,Stan,"No!
"
6,10,Cartman,"Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts. 
"
6,10,Kyle,"No way! Tweek's cool!
"
6,10,Stan,"Yeah!
"
6,10,Cartman,"Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?
"
6,10,Bebe,"Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.
"
6,10,Stan,"Sure thing, Bebe.
"
6,10,Cartman,"That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool. 
"
6,10,Wendy,"What are you doing?!
"
6,10,Clyde,"We're tryin' to get Bebe to run for class president.
"
6,10,Wendy,"I'm class president! The vote was last fall!
"
6,10,Craig,"Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you.
"
6,10,Token,"Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.
"
6,10,The Other Boys,"Uh huh.
"
6,10,Wendy,"She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else! 
"
6,10,Clyde,"What?
"
6,10,Wendy,"Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid! 
"
6,10,Butters,"Stupider than Bebe!
"
6,10,Clyde,"Yeah!
"
6,10,Craig,"Yeah!
"
6,10,Butters,"Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?
"
6,10,Clyde,"Yeah!
"
6,10,Butters,"Yeah!
"
6,10,Craig,"Sure is!
"
6,10,Butters,"Uhyep.
"
6,10,Kyle,"I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
"
6,10,Stan,"Yeah.  Where are you guys going?
"
6,10,Bradley,"We're going to see our friend Bebe.
"
6,10,Stan,"Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
"
6,10,Francis,"Bebe is everybody's friend.
"
6,10,Kevin,"Yeah. God put Bebe on earth to enrich everyone's lives.
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh!
"
6,10,Kyle,"Hoh hoh hoh!
"
6,10,Kevin,"Arf arf!
"
6,10,Francis,"Arf! 
"
6,10,Timmy,"Arf! Ah Timmah! Timmah-ar-argh!
"
6,10,Stan,"Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. 
"
6,10,Bebe's Mom,"Oh, hello, boys.
"
6,10,Stan,"Is Bebe home?
"
6,10,Bebe's Mom,"No, she's with one of her little friends. But she should be back shortly if you boys wanna wait.
"
6,10,Bradley,"Who is she with?
"
6,10,Bebe's Mom,"I believe she is playing ""Lambs"" over at Eric Cartman's house.
"
6,10,Stan,"Cartman's?
"
6,10,Cartman,"And this is Precious.
"
6,10,Bebe,"Precious?
"
6,10,Cartman,"Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. 
"
6,10,Bebe,"Uh huh. 
"
6,10,Cartman,"Now you say, ""It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.""
"
6,10,Bebe,"It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Heheh, yeah.
"
6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"Mister, please let me out of here.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Now say it again, louder.
"
6,10,Bebe,"It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!
"
6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"My parents have money, Mister. They'll give you whatever you want. Please!
"
6,10,Cartman,"Now, just yell ""Put the lotion in the fucking basket!""
"
6,10,Bebe,"Put the lotion in the basket!
"
6,10,Cartman,"Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, ""Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!""
"
6,10,Bebe,"Don't you hurt my fucking dog!
"
6,10,Cartman,"You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- 
"
6,10,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing?
"
6,10,Cartman,"We're playing ""Lambs.""
"
6,10,Kyle,"Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
"
6,10,Butters,"Then we gotta work on your campaign.
"
6,10,Francis,"Right, but first we gotta go to the-
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh! 
"
6,10,Bebe,"You guys, calm down!
"
6,10,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
6,10,Bebe,"This is insane!
"
6,10,Bebe,"Stop it you guys, please!
"
6,10,Bebe,"Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble.
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! 
"
6,10,Bebe's Mom,"Bebe, those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if you'll come out.
"
6,10,Bebe,"I know. They've been there all day. 
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!
"
6,10,Craig,"Hah hah hahah hah! 
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh!
"
6,10,Bebe's Mom,"Looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers.
"
6,10,Bebe,"Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?
"
6,10,Bebe's Mom,"Sweetie, you're just blossoming into a woman.
"
6,10,Bebe,"But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters.
"
6,10,Bebe's Mom,"Sweetie, you're a Stevens. And Stevens women are always told they're really, really smart. 
"
6,10,Bebe,"Mom?  What's six times eight?
"
6,10,Mrs. Stevens,"Oho, sweetie, those are two completely different numbers.  Alright boys, time to be getting home. Bebe's not feeling well and she can't come out today. Go one, shoo. 
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh. Hoh?
"
6,10,Astronaut 1,"Aah. We made it.
"
6,10,Astronaut 2,"Boys, can you call 9-1-1 for us? 
"
6,10,Astronaut 1,"Oh my God. We've landed on Earth thousands of years in the future and apes have taken over!
"
6,10,Astronaut 2,"I knew it! You blew it up, didn't you?!
"
6,10,Astronaut 1,"I don't want to live in this futuristic madness! 
"
6,10,Astronaut 2,"Take your ape rule and go to hell! 
"
6,10,Bebe,"Having boobs sucks.
"
6,10,A Doctor,"Well hello there, little girl. My name is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you today? 
"
6,10,Bebe,"I wanna have breast-reduction surgery. 
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"You?
"
6,10,Bebe,"Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age.
"
6,10,Bebe,"Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane.
"
6,10,Bebe,"I think it's insane to want them bigger.
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Why do you... hate your breasts so?
"
6,10,Bebe,"Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Oh, come on now, that's just silly.
"
6,10,Blonde Nurse,"Here's the Anderson file, Doctor.
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Oh, awesome. Thank you so much, Jillian. That's great. Oh, God-damn. Thanks you so much. 
"
6,10,Brunette Nurse,"And here's the coffee you wanted, doctor.
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Yeah, whatever. Get out of here.  Now, I was saying?
"
6,10,Bebe,"Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want.
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it?
"
6,10,Bebe,"No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"That may be true, but I'm afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl.
"
6,10,Bebe,"Damnit!
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"If, on the other hand, you'd like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm?
"
6,10,Bebe,"Oh, fuck off! 
"
6,10,Sharon,"Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?
"
6,10,Randy,"Why? What's the matter with him?
"
6,10,Sharon,"It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately. 
"
6,10,Stan,"Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta.
"
6,10,Sharon,"He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.
"
6,10,Stan,"Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
"
6,10,Randy,"Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
"
6,10,Sharon,"Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. 
"
6,10,Stan,"Ahta. Ah, ahta!
"
6,10,Randy,"Hey there, son.
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta.
"
6,10,Randy,"Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan.
"
6,10,Stan,"Ahah
"
6,10,Randy,"Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these ""ahta"" will start becoming a major part of your life.
"
6,10,Stan,"Ahta? 
"
6,10,Randy,"But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.
"
6,10,Stan,"Friend. Ahta.
"
6,10,Randy,"I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.
"
6,10,Sharon,"I love you.
"
6,10,Randy,"If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all.
"
6,10,Right Breast,"The boys are at war. All is going as planned.
"
6,10,Left Breast,"Yes. Soon all the boys will be brought to their knees.
"
6,10,Right Breast,"We grow larger every day.
"
6,10,Left Breast,"And stronger.
"
6,10,Right Breast,"Soon the entire tow- 
"
6,10,Left Breast,"Sh! Sh! She's awake!
"
6,10,Right Breast,"Ah, quiet.
"
6,10,Bebe,"MOM!! MOM!!
"
6,10,Mrs. Stevens,"What is it, Bebe?
"
6,10,Bebe,"My breasts!
"
6,10,Mrs. Stevens,"Oh, sweetheart, you're just becoming a young lady.
"
6,10,Bebe,"No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!
"
6,10,Mrs. Stevens,"Yes, darling, your breasts have a power that will unleash itself as you get older. They feed off the misery of boys and grow to bring woe wherever they can. You're blossoming into a woman. 
"
6,10,Bebe,"That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts?
"
6,10,Wendy,"Yes! I want to get breast implants!
"
6,10,Mrs. Testaburger,"I tried to tell her she was too young.
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant.
"
6,10,Mrs. Testaburger,"But she's eight!
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty.
"
6,10,Wendy,"That's what I said.
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"However, young lady, I'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone.  I'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go.
"
6,10,Wendy,"I have three thousand dollars, cash. 
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"You pass. Let's do this thing.
"
6,10,Mrs. Testaburger,"Oh, wait. You're gonna do it right now?
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure.  What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water.
"
6,10,Mrs. Testaburger,"I still don't know about this.
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars?
"
6,10,Dr. Hallis,"Cha!  Gotta!  Jam it!  Up there!  Get!  In!  There!  You!  Bitch!  Get!  In!  There!  You!  Bitch!  Hah!  Okay, there's one, Wendy. Doing great.
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades.
"
6,10,Clyde,"Bebe! Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe! 
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m'kay? 
"
6,10,Bradley,"Bebe! 
"
6,10,Stan,"Ahta! 
"
6,10,Bebe,"Hey guys. 
"
6,10,Craig,"Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be? 
"
6,10,Token,"Yeah. What the hell happened to us?
"
6,10,Stan,"Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Bebe's boobs?
"
6,10,Bebe,"Oh cool! It worked!
"
6,10,Stan,"Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
"
6,10,Kyle,"Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
"
6,10,Bebe,"Yes!
"
6,10,Cartman,"So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
"
6,10,Bebe,"Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.
"
6,10,Kyle,"But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
"
6,10,Stan,"I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
"
6,10,Clyde,"Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid!
"
6,10,Craig,"I'm sorry for fighting, you guys. 
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay?
"
6,10,Clyde,"Let's never let boobs come between us again!
"
6,10,The Boys,"Hear Hear!
"
6,10,Kyle,"Boobs are stupid!
"
6,10,Wendy,"Hi, everybody. 
"
6,10,Clyde,"Look at those ridiculous things!
"
6,10,Butters,"Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!
"
6,10,Cartman,"What a stupid bitch! 
"
6,11,News Anchor,"And in other news, another school shooting has taken place, this time in Idaho. As these kinds of shooting increase, one thing becomes clear: Your children are not safe at school.
"
6,11,Tweek,"Oh God!  Change it! Change it! 
"
6,11,News Anchor,"This was the second time a terrorist threat has been made on a theme park, leaving everyone to realize that children are not safe outside.
"
6,11,Tweek,"Agh! God, change it!! 
"
6,11,News Anchor,"And it seems there's a new danger to look out for: children who are taken by strangers. The bottom line: children are not safe... in their own homes!
"
6,11,Tweek,"Aaaah!!
"
6,11,Tweek's Mom,"Tweek.
"
6,11,Tweek,"Gahahghah
"
6,11,Tweek's Mom,"Tweak? Come to the kitchen, sweetie. We need to see you real quick. 
"
6,11,Tweek,"Oh God. They're gonna get me.
"
6,11,Richard,"Sit down and have some coffee, son.  Tweek, there's starting to be a lot of reports in the news about kids being abducted, and we thought we should talk.
"
6,11,Tweek,"I s-I saw! Uuuh!
"
6,11,Tweek's Mom,"You know never to talk to strangers, right Tweek? You can't trust anybody.
"
6,11,Tweek,"Oh God! Huh!
"
6,11,Richard,"Now, we don't want to alarm you, son, but we've installed new locks on your bedroom windows and door. Important for you to know never to unlock them at night for anyone except your mother and I.
"
6,11,Tweek,"Oh Jesus! Huh!
"
6,11,Tweek's Mom,"It's just a precaution, sweetie. Probably nothing will ever happen.
"
6,11,Tweek,"No, ...NO! They're gonna get me!  GAAAH! Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God.  Uh, just a dream.  OH MY GOD!!  GAAAH!! 
"
6,11,Voice,"Tweek! This is Officer Daniels! Now, try and stay calm, but we believe an abductor is in your room!
"
6,11,Tweek,"...Inside my room? Oh God!
"
6,11,Voice,"Give it up, buddy! We've got ya surrounded! Okay, Tweek, I want you to very calmly but quickly walk to the door and come out to us!
"
6,11,Tweek,"Oh my God!  Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this.  AAAHH!
"
6,11,Voice,"Bang!  You're dead, Tweek. 
"
6,11,Tweek,"What?
"
6,11,Richard,"You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and I?
"
6,11,Tweek,"Oh God! Oh Jesus!
"
6,11,Tweek's Mom,"What if that had been a child abductor pretending to be a police officer, Tweek?
"
6,11,Richard,"He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods.  You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest.
"
6,11,Tweek's Mom,"'Night, pumpkin. 
"
6,11,Stan,"I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.
"
6,11,Kyle,"It will.
"
6,11,Cartman,"One please.
"
6,11,Tweek,"Wait, that's not the usual ticket-taker guy!
"
6,11,Kyle,"So?
"
6,11,Tweek,"So? I don't know him!
"
6,11,Cartman,"Dude, relax.
"
6,11,Tweek,"You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!! 
"
6,11,Cartman,"Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?
"
6,11,Driver,"'Scuse me, is this the right road to Breckenridge.
"
6,11,Tweek,"AAH! Uh...
"
6,11,Driver,"Please, I just need to know if this is ""South Park""?
"
6,11,Tweek,"Get away from meee! 
"
6,11,Elderly Lady,"Could you help me across the street?
"
6,11,Tweek,"I don't know you!  Ah, AAAH!
"
6,11,Man in Wheelchair,"Oh, hey, kid!  Oh, thank God you happened by. My- my chair ran out of juice right on these train tracks. If you hadn't had shown up, well... Well, anyway, could you give me a push?
"
6,11,Tweek,"Huh uh!
"
6,11,Man in Wheelchair,"No, no, you don't understand. I'm, I'm paralyzed from the neck down. I push the chair with this device in front of my mouth, but it's it's not working, so you see-
"
6,11,Tweek,"I'm not supposed to talk to you!
"
6,11,Man in Wheelchair,"Please, this, this isn't funny, kid. You have to help me.
"
6,11,Tweek,"But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick.
"
6,11,Tweek,"AaaaAAAHH! 
"
6,11,Man,"Relax, Tweek. I am not here to hurt you. I am the Ghost of Human Kindness.
"
6,11,Tweek,"The Ghost of Human Kindness?
"
6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness,"You have never seen the likes of me before.
"
6,11,Tweek,"What do you want?
"
6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness,"You have lost faith in humanity, lad. Something I cannot bear to see happen.
"
6,11,Tweek,"Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.
"
6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness,"That is the world of the news reports. It is the world that adults preoccupy themselves with, but it is not the world as it is.
"
6,11,Tweek,"It isn't?
"
6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness,"Look here, Tweek. This woman is on her way to the retirement home.  She doesn't get paid; she volunteers her time to talk with lonely elderly people who want nothing more than a friend.  But do you hear about her on the news? No.
"
6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness,"Now gaze upon this humble house, Tweek. Inside there are two people who have adopted needy children.  They were strangers to those kids once. Now they are loving parents
"
6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness,"Now, look here, boy.  A car has broken down with a flat tire, and two complete strangers have stopped to help.  Will their kindness be reported on the news tomorrow? I think not.
"
6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness,"Are you starting to understand, boy?
"
6,11,Tweek,"I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.
"
6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness,"That's right, lad. So do you think you can learn to trust people now?
"
6,11,Tweek,"I'll... try.
"
6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness,"Good. Then why don't you get into the back of my van, and I'll drive you home. 
"
6,11,Tweek,"Your van? 
"
6,11,Officer 1,"Alright Johnson, give it up!
"
6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness,"Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!  Oh, I was so close!
"
6,11,Tweek,"What the hell is going on?
"
6,11,Tweek's Mom,"Tweek, Tweek, are you okay?
"
6,11,Richard,"Did he hurt you, son?
"
6,11,Tweek,"No
"
6,11,Detective,"Then we aren't too late. His name is Frederick Johnson. He's been abducting children by dressing up like the Ghost of Human Kindness for over a year now.
"
6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness,"And I would have gotten away with it again if it weren't for you meddling policemen! 
"
6,11,Liane,"What's going on?
"
6,11,Sharon,"A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy.
"
6,11,Sheila,"An abductor in our town?
"
6,11,Tom,"Oh my God, what are we gonna do?
"
6,11,Townsfolk,"Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
"
6,11,Mayor McDaniels,"People, people, calm down.
"
6,11,Randy,"Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!
"
6,11,Townsfolk,"Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
"
6,11,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes, but standing out here yelling ""Rabble rabble rabble"" isn't going to help anything.
"
6,11,Jimbo,"Well we don't know what else to do, Mayor!
"
6,11,Townsfolk,"Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble.
"
6,11,Mayor McDaniels,"People, what do you think we need to do?
"
6,11,Gerald,"Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers!
"
6,11,Sheila,"Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids.
"
6,11,Townsfolk,"Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
"
6,11,Randy,"Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.
"
6,11,Richard,"That's... not a bad idea, a city wall.
"
6,11,Sheila,"But who can we get to build it?
"
6,11,Mayor McDaniels,"...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city.
"
6,11,City Wok Owner,"I don' build wall. I just own un' operate City Wok.
"
6,11,Gerald,"We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.
"
6,11,City Wok Owner,"Oh, I get it. Just because I Chinese, you think I build wall. That i' bullshit! I'm not stereotype, okay?! Just because I'm Chinese doesn't mean I go around building wall! I'm just a normal person like all o'you! I eat ahrice and drive ahreally slow, just like the rest o'you! I'm not stereotype!
"
6,11,Sharon,"Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim.
"
6,11,Randy,"Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.
"
6,11,Tuong,"Hey. Hey hey!  Hey, what the hell you doing?!  Mongorians? What the hell Mongorians doing here?  Ey, fuck you, Mongorians! Tryin' break down my wall!  Get out of here, fuckin' Mongorians!  God-damnit, how come every time us Chinese put up a wall, stupid Mongorians have to come and knock it down?
"
6,11,Randy,"Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.
"
6,11,Stan,"Child Tracker?
"
6,11,Sharon,"It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.
"
6,11,Randy,"If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.
"
6,11,Randy,"There, I think that's got it. 
"
6,11,Stan,"...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
"
6,11,Randy,"You can barely even tell you have one on.
"
6,11,Stan,"I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
"
6,11,Sharon,"I wouldn't worry about that.
"
6,11,Cartman,"So weak. So weak, dude. Man.
"
6,11,Kyle,"Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
"
6,11,Tweek,"I didn't mean to.
"
6,11,Tuong,"Okay. Finary.  Oh no.  It's those God-damned Mongorians again! Stop! Stop right there, Mongorians!  God-damnit, stop!  Stop breaking down my city wall you stupid Mongoriaaans!  Ay, you sons of bitches, you-  What the hell?  Oh, shit!  OH, GOD-DAMNED MONGORIANS!!  I'm gonna get you, fuckin' Mongorians! Don't break down my city wall!  Oh, God-damnit!  That's the last time you're gonna break down my city wall! You hear me, Mongorians?!  God-damned Mongorians.
"
6,11,Richard,"Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there and we're gonna give 'em hell! 
"
6,11,Kyle,"But, wait. Where's the other team? 
"
6,11,Randy,"There is no other team.
"
6,11,Stan,"Huh?
"
6,11,Richard,"Well, we've... put a wall around the city to keep outsiders out. You don't think we want a bunch of strangers coming in to play ball, do you?
"
6,11,Stan,"But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
"
6,11,Randy,"Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. 
"
6,11,Townsfolk,"Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows!
"
6,11,Jimbo,"Play ball!  Steeeeee-riiike
"
6,11,Townsfolk,"Yeah! Woohoo! Yeah!
"
6,11,Jimbo,"South Park Cows do it again!
"
6,11,Sharon,"Congratulations on your victory, boys. 
"
6,11,Kyle,"Dude, we weren't playing anybody.
"
6,11,Randy,"Yeah, and you kicked ass!
"
6,11,Mr. Donovan,"Isn't it awesome havin' a great wall around our city? Nobody in town except for our good friends.
"
6,11,Townsfolk,"Yeahah! Alright! Yeah. Right on! Right on!
"
6,11,Richard,"Guys! Sh, quiet everyone. 
"
6,11,News Anchor,"And this newest study reveals more about child abductions than we apparently knew before, Tom. 
"
6,11,Sharon,"Turn it up.
"
6,11,Tom,"That's right, Chris. This newest study shows that the majority of child abductions are NOT committed by strangers, but by somebody the child knows in their own town.  The report further states that it is because the child trusts the individual that problems occur in the first place.
"
6,11,Chris,"Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak.
"
6,11,Tom,"Sure does, Tom.
"
6,11,Chris,"Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su- 
"
6,11,Richard,"Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now. 
"
6,11,Gerald,"Yeah. Come along, Kyle 
"
6,11,Sharon,"Stanley, time for us to get back to the house.
"
6,11,Stan,"I'm not done with my pizza.
"
6,11,Sharon,"NOW, Stanley! 
"
6,11,Tuong,"Eh. Eh, eh, there we go.  All finished. My Mongolian Missile Defense system.  Those Mongolians try to break down my city wall again, they gonna get a big heat-seeking missile surprise!  Oh! Hello Mongolians. Yeah. You come to break down my city wall?  Oh, you gonna throw that baseball at my wall?  Oh no! Not a baseball! I'm pretty scared.  Well, you know what? I might have something here that's a little bigger than a baseball.  Say hello to my little friend!  Aw, crap.  Ooohhhh  God-damned Mongolians!! You break down my city wall foda last time!!
"
6,11,Stan,"Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.
"
6,11,Richard,"'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here.
"
6,11,Sharon,"Right. Do what you normally would do.
"
6,11,Kyle,"You're such a fatass, Cartman.
"
6,11,Cartman,"At least I'm not a stupid Jew.
"
6,11,Sheila,"What what whaaat?
"
6,11,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids, so, now, who can tell me what year the first moon landing took place?  Uh, how about you, Clyde?
"
6,11,Mr. Donovan,"Nineteen six-
"
6,11,Mr. Mackey,"No helping!  M'kay, I'm not really sure havin' all the parents here is a good idea, m'kay?
"
6,11,Richard,"Well, maybe things could be better if we could trust people like the Stotches!
"
6,11,Chris,"Us? Your family's all be the shifty-eyed ones!
"
6,11,Richard,"Oh yeah?! 
"
6,11,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, this is too much to take.  Mom, Dad, could you please leave me alone?
"
6,11,Mr. Mackey's Father,"We just wanna make sure nobody hurts you, Junior, m'kay?
"
6,11,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay.
"
6,11,Tuong,"Hahahaha! My masterpiece!  When those Mongolians come next time, I pour this sweet and sour pork on their heads. Haha, sweet and sour pork so hot and sticky, Mongolians'll stick ahright up to the wall! And scream ""UhwOoOoOoOoo!"" Oh I can't wait.  Oh, I get it. A Trojan Mongolian horse. Mongolians a-hiding inside thinking that I'll bring it in city wall, then Mongolians pop out and destroy wall from the inside out without gettin' any sweet and sour pork on their heads! Okay. I'll pray around.  Oh! Oh rook! Rook, my very own Mongorian Trojan horse! Gee, what a surprise! I guess Mongorians aren't such crappy, smelly people after all!  Yeah. Great! Rwow!  Yeah, what a great present! I'm just gonna push it inside the gate and soon tell all my friends.  Oh, it's sweet and sour pork!  Oh! I'm going to get you Nogodians, if it's the last thing I do!
"
6,11,News Anchor,"And so all the residents of Manhattan are prepared to evacuate if Ms. Clinton's ass gets any bigger. And in other news, new findings on the increase in child abductions.
"
6,11,Richard,"Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey!
"
6,11,News Anchor,"The study shows that the most likely abductors of children... are the parents themselves!  The study reveals that nine out of every ten abduction cases are committed by the child's mother or father. The bottom line being that your children aren't safe, even from you! 
"
6,11,Richard,"Where are you going?
"
6,11,Mrs. Tweek,"Uh. I'm just going to go upstairs and see if Tweek is still in his bed.
"
6,11,Richard,"Oh?  I think I'll go with you.
"
6,11,Mrs. Tweek,"It's okay. I can do it.
"
6,11,Richard,"I just want to make sure that you-
"
6,11,Mrs. Tweek,"That I don't abduct him? How do I know that you haven't done it already?
"
6,11,Richard,"Me? I would never abduct our son!
"
6,11,Mrs. Tweek,"That's not what the new study says!
"
6,11,Richard,"Well what are we supposed to do, eh-? How can we protect Tweek from ourselves? 
"
6,11,Randy,"Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years.
"
6,11,Stan,"But why do I have to leave?
"
6,11,Randy,"The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.
"
6,11,Sharon,"Good-bye, son.  Remember to eat right.
"
6,11,Gerald,"Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now.
"
6,11,Sheila,"Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you! 
"
6,11,Linda Stotch,"Be careful out there!
"
6,11,Stan,"Where are we supposed to go?
"
6,11,Randy,"We can't tell you because we can't know where you are! 
"
6,11,Sheila,"Oh, this is terrible! 
"
6,11,Mr. Donovan,"Go on, kids! Go! Go and don't look back! 
"
6,11,Randy,"Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you. 
"
6,11,Stan,"Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
"
6,11,A woman,"Oh my God.
"
6,11,Tuong,"Ah. Hey daw. O'er 'ere. O'er 'ere, dog. Got som'in sweet and souh foh ya.  Good dog! That's it! Keep licking, dog!
"
6,11,Tuong,"Hahahahahaaa! I'm free, Mongolians! And now I'm gonna make you PAY!
"
6,11,News Anchor,"Finally, some good news tonight. It's been several days since any child abductions have taken place. The main reason: parents don't know where their children are. 
"
6,11,Randy,"What's the matter? 
"
6,11,Sharon,"Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay.
"
6,11,Randy,"Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. 
"
6,11,Sharon,"Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town to live on their own?
"
6,11,Randy,"Sweetheart, you saw the news...
"
6,11,Sharon,"I know. 
"
6,11,Randy,"Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.
"
6,11,Leader,"Tah tane da ke ab kahleh kalabush.
"
6,11,Stan,"Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. 
"
6,11,Mongolian,"De bandig baeakhalah?
"
6,11,Cartman,"Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.
"
6,11,Tweek,"Triben fak burushban.
"
6,11,All,"Shain balag!
"
6,11,Tuong,"Awright, Mongolians! Your only way through this wall is through me. This is my rast stand! I'm gonna do my war dance now.  Does my war dance ascare you, Mongolians? Yeah, you think you want a piece of this?  This is ancient Chinese dance of a- Oh, herro kids. Uh be careful, there's a-Mongolians up there.  Oh, crap! 
"
6,11,Randy,"What's going on?
"
6,11,Liane,"I heard an explosion.
"
6,11,Tuong,"God-damned Mongolians attacked city wall again! 
"
6,11,Man in Back,"Mongolians?
"
6,11,Randy,"What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!
"
6,11,Adults,"Rabble rabble rabble rabble!
"
6,11,Richard,"Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are... our children. 
"
6,11,Sheila,"Ike? Kyle?
"
6,11,Sharon,"My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!! 
"
6,11,Richard,"Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are.
"
6,11,Mr. Donovan,"Kids? Don't you remember us?
"
6,11,Randy,"Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro.
"
6,11,Stan,"Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 
"
6,11,Randy,"Bi kute.
"
6,11,Mr. Donovan,"We are your parents. You used to live here, with us.
"
6,11,Kyle,"Yeah, it was like four days ago!
"
6,11,Richard,"They're starting to remember.
"
6,11,Randy,"Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!
"
6,11,Stan,"Uh huh, Stan Marsh.
"
6,11,Randy,"That's it! Remember, son! Rememmmber! 
"
6,11,Richard,"We're sorry, Tweek!
"
6,11,Mr. Donovan,"Are you okay, Clyde?
"
6,11,Chris,"Oh, son, can you ever forgive us?
"
6,11,Butters,"Huh, I'm over here, Dad.
"
6,11,Chris,"Oh. 
"
6,11,Sheila,"We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.
"
6,11,Richard,"Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along.
"
6,11,Mr. Donovan,"You mean how he said we should trust each other, or how he abducted children?
"
6,11,Richard,"The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did.
"
6,11,Adults,"Wow, yeah. Oh yeah.
"
6,11,Randy,"No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.
"
6,11,Adults,"Whoa! Wow. Right!
"
6,11,Chris,"Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah.
"
6,11,Tuong,"Aw, you'd better not say what I think you're gonna say.
"
6,11,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Lu Kim, tear down this wall!
"
6,11,Tuong,"Oh, God! I hate this whole shitty!
"
6,11,Sharon,"Randy, can we just take our son home now?
"
6,11,Randy,"Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home. Hoomme. 
"
6,11,Stan,"Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. 
"
6,12,Lolly,"Oh, hello there, kids! Welcome to Lolly's Candy Shop.
"
6,12,Stan,"We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
"
6,12,Lolly,"Oh that's great!
"
6,12,Cartman,"You bet your fat clown ass it is!
"
6,12,Lolly,"Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket stub.
"
6,12,Cartman,"...ticket stub?
"
6,12,Lolly,"You know. When you entered the contest you got the other half of this ticket. 
"
6,12,Stan,"Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
"
6,12,Kyle,"It was such a long time ago!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Wu-we don't really ""need"" the ticket stub, do we?
"
6,12,Lolly,"Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you high?? How else do I know you're the winners?
"
6,12,Stan,"Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
"
6,12,Lolly,"Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy shopping spree. If you find it, you can come back, but you only have one week to claim the prize. That's called ""The Ticking Clock."" Works great in the movies. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"GODDAMMIT!!!
"
6,12,Stan,"We've gotta find that ticket!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
"
6,12,Cartman,"You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. 
"
6,12,Lolly,"All right. There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. You'll need it to claim your prize.  Sign up for the five-minute shopping spree!! 
"
6,12,Stan,"You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
"
6,12,Kenny,"(Okay.) 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Kenny!!!
"
6,12,"Stan, Kyle","AAAHHH!! 
"
6,12,Stuart,"Yes?
"
6,12,Stan,"Where's Kenny??
"
6,12,Stuart,"Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?
"
6,12,Kyle,"We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??
"
6,12,Kenny's Mom,"His body? Well, why??
"
6,12,Cartman,"Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
"
6,12,Stan,"Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Yeah. Closure.
"
6,12,Cartman,"What the fuck is closure?!
"
6,12,Kenny's Mom,"Oh all right boys. Come on in. 
"
6,12,Stuart,"We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him.
"
6,12,Kenny's Mom,"Here he is, boys. Our dear little Kenny. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"You turned him into a teapot?
"
6,12,Stuart,"No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it.
"
6,12,Kenny's Mom,"Your friends are here to see you, Kenny.  They miss you an awful lot, like we all do. 
"
6,12,Stuart,"Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us.  Aw now, honey. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Wewewewewewe...
"
6,12,Stan,"Did you get it? 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...
"
6,12,Kyle,"There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 
"
6,12,Robot Guard,"Wewewewewewe...
"
6,12,Kyle,"Alright, we made it!
"
6,12,Stan,"Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Let him out, Cartman! 
"
6,12,Cartman,"...Kenny?  Kenny?!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Is he in there?
"
6,12,Stan,"I can't see. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
"
6,12,Kyle,"I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! 
"
6,12,Stan,"It wa a trick!
"
6,12,Cartman,"God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
"
6,12,Stan,"Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
"
6,12,Cartman,"Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
"
6,12,Stan,"We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Goddamnit! There has to be a way! 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad. 
"
6,12,Kenny's Mom,"Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school! 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. 
"
6,12,Stan,"Cartman, come on!
"
6,12,Cartman,"What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!
"
6,12,Stan,"Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
"
6,12,Cartman,"How?
"
6,12,Kyle,"A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
"
6,12,Randy,"Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.
"
6,12,Stan,"We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
"
6,12,Randy,"A ladder to heaven? Why, son?
"
6,12,Stan,"Because we wanna see Kenny again. 
"
6,12,Sharon,"Oh... oh, that's so sweet.
"
6,12,Randy,"That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard.
"
6,12,Jimbo,"Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh...  What the hell are they doing?
"
6,12,Randy,"The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven.
"
6,12,Jimbo,"Awwww.
"
6,12,Sheila,"Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough.
"
6,12,Randy,"No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny.
"
6,12,Jimbo,"A ladder tuh... Oh... oh God. 
"
6,12,Sheila,"Oh, that's so touching. 
"
6,12,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where last December, eight-year-old Kenny McCormick died of a terminal illness. But now, that little boy's three closest friends miss their friend so much that they are building a ladder to heaven, in order to-  a ladder to heaven in order to try to see him again.  It's so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's what some people had to say.
"
6,12,Randy,"Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.
"
6,12,Sheila,"They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!
"
6,12,Jimbo,"It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is. 
"
6,12,Mr. Garrison,"A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid.
"
6,12,Mayor McDaniels,"These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible?
"
6,12,Field Reporter,"Tom, people from all over the-  Sorry.  People from all over the country are coming to see the ladder, feeling a connection to its symbolism, and beauty. Even country singer Alan Jackson has shown up with a song he has written about the ladder.  Alan Jackson is, of course, the man who wrote the song, ""Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning,"" about the tragedies on September 11. And now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions. Let's listen in. 
"
6,12,Alan Jackson,"Where were you when they built the ladder to heaven? 
Did it make you feel like cryin', or did you think it was kind of gay?
"
6,12,Townsman,"What a beautiful song. 
"
6,12,Alan Jackson,"Well I, for one, believe in the ladder to heaven.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. 9-11
I said 9-11, 9-11, 9-11, Ni-hi, hi-hine___
Eleven.
Thank you! I have a new CD out with all my 9-11 songs for sale right here! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
"
6,12,Cartman,"I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. 
"
6,12,Stan,"Mr. Garrison threw away his car?
"
6,12,Cartman,"...No.  Ey! Euuugh.
"
6,12,Kenny's Mom,"Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school! 
"
6,12,Stuart,"Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys?  Kenny?! Answer me!! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Cartman? Cartman?!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Wha-uh, what?? What?
"
6,12,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!
"
6,12,Cartman,"I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Maybe you got brain cancer.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Do you think?
"
6,12,Stan,"Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!
"
6,12,SNN Reporter,"The nation is rallying behind three sweet boys in Colorado who are building a ladder to heaven to be with their dead friend.  It's making Americans start to believe in heaven, again. 
"
6,12,Woman 1,"Well when I see how this ladder has brought people together, how... how it has changed America, I mean, how can I not believe?
"
6,12,SNN Reporter,"Ha do YOU actually believe in the ladder to heaven?
"
6,12,Fat Man,"If... heaven is an eight-year-old boy, and the ladder is my penis...  and the pearly gates are the- 
"
6,12,SNN Reporter,"Uh, meanwhile, the American economy cont-  wait. Wait. Wait a minute. We are getting reports now that Japan is building their own ladder to heaven to compete with the US's. Let's go live to SNN correspondent Nobuhiro Sabasurisurijuwa.
"
6,12,SNN Correspondent,"This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from Tokyo, where Japan has started buirding its own radder to hayben.  Ahready, the Japanese radder extend faaar into space  and it's growing by a-one thousand miles every day.  As the endeavor continues it is becoming clear that Japan will reach a-hayben before the United States. 
"
6,12,Neighbors,"Nahurabo Nahurabo
"
6,12,Stan,"Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
"
6,12,Man 1,"Oh no!
"
6,12,Woman 2,"Oh Jesus, no!
"
6,12,Alan Jackson,"Where were you when they ran out of stuff to build the ladder to heaven?
"
6,12,Stan,"We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
"
6,12,Randy,"No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough.
"
6,12,Gerald,"Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven. 
"
6,12,Man 2,"Wait! Look! 
"
6,12,General,"We've come to help you beat those Japs, boys!  There won't be anyone stopping this great ladder from being built today!  Alpha Team! Get that support structure up! Ciranom's Team! Get us photos and recon! 
"
6,12,Soldiers,"Yes sir!
"
6,12,Alan Jackson,"Where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven?
"
6,12,Kyle,"Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Do you see anything?
"
6,12,Stan,"No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??
"
6,12,Kyle,"Grandma??
"
6,12,Cartman,"Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!
"
6,12,Stan,"No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Huh?
"
6,12,Cartman,"Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.
"
6,12,Stan,"What??
"
6,12,Cartman,"You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.
"
6,12,Kyle,"What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
"
6,12,Kyle,"HAAHH!!! 
"
6,12,Cartman,"AH! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Hey Kenny.
"
6,12,Stan,"Hey Kenny.
"
6,12,Kenny,"(We can watch it at my house.)
"
6,12,Cartman,"In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto
"
6,12,Kenny,"(Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
"
6,12,Cartman,"What did you say?!
"
6,12,Kenny,"(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
"
6,12,Cartman,"What did you say?!
"
6,12,Cartman,"I said ""Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!""  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?
"
6,12,Stan,"Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
"
6,12,Cartman,"I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.
"
6,12,Kyle,"You're too fat to be Kenny.
"
6,12,Cartman,"You're a- stupid Jew.
"
6,12,Stan,"Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
"
6,12,Bush,"Alright, how's the ladder going, General? Are we beating the Japanese.
"
6,12,General,"Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein.
"
6,12,Bush,"Saddam Hussein? But... we killed him! We secretly took him out months ago!
"
6,12,General,"Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.
"
6,12,Bush,"Dear Christ, that sonofabitch just doesn't stop!
"
6,12,General,"These surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven.  Here we see what we believe to be a missile silo. And here  we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons.
"
6,12,Dick Cheney,"That... kinda looks like a seagull.
"
6,12,General,"Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull.
"
6,12,Bush,"That tricky bastard!
"
6,12,General,"Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must...  bomb heaven!
"
6,12,SNN Reporter,"SNN Question of the Day: Now that Americans believe in heaven, should we bomb it? The polls right now show that 51% of Americans think Saddam has to be dealt with, while 49% are wimpy tree-hugging pussies.
"
6,12,War Protester,"War is not my voice! This country is just run by rednecks and bumpkins with their guns!
"
6,12,Redneck,"We have to take Saddam out to protect ourselves.
"
6,12,Fat Man,"I, for one, believe that if Saddam Hussein were an eight-year-old boy, and my penis were the United States...  then there would-  hard nipples!
"
6,12,SNN Reporter,"God-damnit! 
"
6,12,Field Reporter,"Tom, it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and caption the nation's hearts. They've made a nation believe heaven might be up there. And it could prove to be a threat to our country. President Bush will seek UN approval for military action.
"
6,12,Randy,"Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...
"
6,12,Gerald,"But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.
"
6,12,Stan,"No, we have to see Kenny!
"
6,12,Sharon,"You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.
"
6,12,Stan,"Cremated? What's that?
"
6,12,Randy,"When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. 
"
6,12,Kyle,"What?? For God's sake, why??
"
6,12,Sheila,"Kyle, it's just what some people do.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Are you gonna burn me?
"
6,12,Gerald,"Kyle, that's not the issue right now.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Jesus Christ!
"
6,12,Randy,"The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.
"
6,12,Kenny's Mom,"You see boys, Kenny is in here.  What the???  Wait a minute! This is kitty litter!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.
"
6,12,Stuart,"You WHAT??
"
6,12,Stan,"Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Shut up!
"
6,12,Kyle,"You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Shut up!
"
6,12,Kenny's Mom,"Oh my God! This is awful!  And disgusting!
"
6,12,Liane,"Bad, Eric, bad! 
"
6,12,Cartman,"That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.
"
6,12,Stan,"Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Yeah. Good job, fatass! 
"
6,12,Cartman,"I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Looks like I've come to the right place.
"
6,12,Nurse,"Can I help you?
"
6,12,Cartman,"Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.
"
6,12,Nurse,"You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! 
"
6,12,Boyfriend,"It's gonna be okay, babe.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!
"
6,12,Woman,"Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it! 
"
6,12,Steven,"Damnit! Damnit!  Thanks a lot, kid! 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Eh! 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Kenny! Kenny! kenny...
"
6,12,Stan,Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!
6,12,Kyle,We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!
6,12,Lolly,"Alright! There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. 
"
6,12,Stan,"Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...
"
6,12,Kyle,"Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
"
6,12,Kenny,(Okay!) 
6,12,Cartman,"You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!"
6,12,Cartman,"The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere!  Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!
"
6,12,Bush,"Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction.  We have tried to communicate with Saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven. But he has not ""re-spond-ed"".
"
6,12,Indian Ambassador,"Of course he has not responded, because he's DEAD!
"
6,12,Bush,"Right. Dead, and in heaven.
"
6,12,Another Ambassador,"This is preposterous! Even if there was a heaven, what makes you think Saddam Hussein's soul would be sent there?
"
6,12,Bush,"Our intelligence tells us that when Saddam was originally killed, his soul actually went to hell. But while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Satan, however, decided he didn't want to be with Hussein anymore and broke up with him about August.  When Saddam became jealous and tried to kill Satan's new lover, Chris, Satan had Saddam sent to heaven to live with Mormons as a punishment.  Question?  Yes?
"
6,12,Another Ambassador,"Are you high, or just incredibly stupid?
"
6,12,Bush,"I assure you, I am not high.
"
6,12,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"What do you mean, fatass?
"
6,12,Cartman,"I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.
"
6,12,Stan,"Where??
"
6,12,Cartman,"I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Do you see anything?
"
6,12,Cartman,"Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! 
"
6,12,Stan,"Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Not by giving me brain damage!
"
6,12,Stan,"Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...
"
6,12,Sharon,"Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!
"
6,12,Randy,"What? 
"
6,12,Sharon,"See for yourself!
"
6,12,SNN Correspondent,"This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from hayben.  The great a-nation of Japan reached a-hayben today about eight o'crock Pacific Standard Time-eh.  Therefore, hayben is now a-decrared an official part of Japan, because we got a-here first. And now for the weather in heaben, let's go to Natsako Semu.
"
6,12,Natsako Semu,"Todeh weather in hebon, partry croudy.
"
6,12,Nobunaga,"That's the news from heben.  Dame! Dame da! Bakayarou da!! 
"
6,12,Randy,"Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.
"
6,12,Gerald,"Kids!
"
6,12,Bush,"Good. As soon as the boys finish their ladder we'll be ready to take Saddam out.
"
6,12,Sharon,"Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?
"
6,12,Randy,"If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. 
"
6,12,Stan,"Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. 
"
6,12,Some Guy,"Dude.
"
6,12,George Bush,"Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese won't let us use theirs.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
"
6,12,Randy,"Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??
"
6,12,Cartman,"...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before.
"
6,12,Field Reporter,"But... what about your lost friend? What about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven?
"
6,12,Stan,"Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
"
6,12,Kyle,"Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.
"
6,12,General,"So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!
"
6,12,Johnson,"Sir!
"
6,12,Randy,"No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.
"
6,12,Crowd,"Awwww. 
"
6,12,Bush,"And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam could actually be up there buildin' bombs.
"
6,12,Alan Jackson,"Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, you couldn't really get there?  You little bastards ruined my latest song! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
"
6,12,Stan,"Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
"
6,12,Cartman,"No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?
"
6,12,Cartman,"Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! 
"
6,12,Stan,"Dude, come back here! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Stop him, Kenny! 
"
6,12,Saddam Hussein,"Keep those nitrogen capsules over there by the warheads! Right. Chop-chop. Come on!
"
6,12,God,"Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that you're secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here.
"
6,12,Saddam Hussein,"Weapons of mass destruction? Nooo! This is a chocolate chip factory. See? 
"
6,12,God,"It looks like a chemical weapons plant.
"
6,12,Saddam Hussein,"Look, God, if I was gonna secretly build a chemical weapons plant, I wouldn't make it look like a chemical weapons plant, would I? I'd make it look like a chocolate chip factory or something.
"
6,12,God,"...Alright, just checking. 
"
6,12,Saddam Hussein,"Stupid asshole! 
"
6,13,Stan,"O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
"
6,13,Cartman,"Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
"
6,13,Kyle,"That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
"
6,13,Randy,"Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?
"
6,13,Stan,"You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
"
6,13,Randy,"Yeah, whatever.
"
6,13,Cartman,"It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
"
6,13,Kyle,"But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
"
6,13,Stan,"Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
"
6,13,Stan/Kyle/ Cartman,"Ho! 
"
6,13,Randy,"Hmmm, that gets rid of them.
"
6,13,Sharon,"Oooh, you're a little frisky, aren't you?
"
6,13,Randy,"Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.
"
6,13,Sharon,"Oho, you little devil.
"
6,13,Randy,"You wanna go watch?
"
6,13,Stan,"How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
"
6,13,Kyle,"Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
"
6,13,Cartman,"Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. 
"
6,13,Stan,"Good job, wizard.
"
6,13,Cartman,"And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.
"
6,13,Kyle,"I'm a Paladin, Cartman!
"
6,13,Cartman,"Jews can't be Paladins.
"
6,13,Sharon,"Hey there, cowboy.
"
6,13,Randy,"You ready for some hot, steamy fun?
"
6,13,Sharon,"You bet I am.
"
6,13,Randy,"The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, ""this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made."" 
"
6,13,Sharon,"Mmm, sounds good.
"
6,13,Randy,"I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that?
"
6,13,Sharon,"Mm, yeah baby.
"
6,13,Randy,"Yeeaahhh.  Alright, you ready?
"
6,13,Sharon,"Ready.
"
6,13,Randy,"Oh, yeah. 
"
6,13,Narrator,"The story begins in ages past, in the deep regions of Middle-earth, where Scorn first thrived in the kingdom of Gelgelar.
"
6,13,Randy,"Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.
"
6,13,Narrator,"Seven rings were cast and given to the races of Men.
"
6,13,Randy,"Oh yeah. 
"
6,13,Narrator,"Seven, to the races of Elves, five to the gloondock villagers of Gelgendor. 
"
6,13,Sharon,"Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. 
"
6,13,Randy,"Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!
"
6,13,Sharon,"But then that mean..?
"
6,13,Randy,"The boys have the hottest porno ever made.
"
6,13,Chris,"Oh, hello boys.
"
6,13,Stan,"My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
"
6,13,Chris,"Well, thank you very much, kind heroes.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
"
6,13,Chris,"Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough. 
"
6,13,Cartman,"Man, that's crap.
"
6,13,Chris,"Butters,  look what we have for you to watch: The Lord of the Rings.
"
6,13,Butters,"Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!
"
6,13,Linda,"Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?
"
6,13,Butters,"Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!
"
6,13,Chris,"That's our man. Here you go. 
"
6,13,Butters,"Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. 
"
6,13,Evan Stone,"Spank that ass. 
"
6,13,Butters,"Whoa.  Neat-o.  Well, this is good.
"
6,13,Sharon,"Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. ""Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back."" 
"
6,13,Randy,"Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
"
6,13,Cartman,"And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
"
6,13,Stan,"The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 
"
6,13,Kyle,"Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
"
6,13,Cartman,"Prepare for battle! 
"
6,13,Sharon,"The boys! 
"
6,13,Randy,"Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape?
"
6,13,Stan,"We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
"
6,13,Sharon,"Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now.
"
6,13,Randy,"Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? 
"
6,13,Cartman,"This sounds like a really important quest.
"
6,13,Randy,"Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.
"
6,13,Stan,"Woww.
"
6,13,Cartman,"This... is so cool.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Gentlemen, we are off! 
"
6,13,Randy,"Okay, problem solved.
"
6,13,Woman,"...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm...
"
6,13,Butters,"Oh golly.  Hey, what's happening down there? 
"
6,13,Stan,"We have come to reclaim the one tape! 
"
6,13,Butters,"Wha-wha, what are you doing?! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
"
6,13,Butters,"But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. 
"
6,13,Butters,"Bwaagghh! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
"
6,13,Butters,"Well, then... then let me go with you.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 
"
6,13,Butters,"Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
"
6,13,Butters,"Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
"
6,13,Butters,"Let me have the tape!
"
6,13,Stan,"No, we have to return it! 
"
6,13,Butters,"My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
"
6,13,Cartman,"And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
"
6,13,Kyle,"This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
"
6,13,Stan,"Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. 
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Well, well, well! If it isn't Robin Hood and his Merry Men!
"
6,13,Kyle,"Oh, crap, the sixth graders!
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Whatcha got there?
"
6,13,Stan,"Nothing.  Hey, kid!
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Lord of the Rings? Ha! That movie's gay!
"
6,13,Cartman,"You're gay!
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"What the--?  Whoa!  Check it out, you guys!
"
6,13,Sixth Graders 2/3,"Whoa!
"
6,13,Stan,"Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"No way! We're keepin' this and watchin' it ourselves!
"
6,13,Kyle,"You can't keep it.
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"And what are three little fourth graders gonna do about it, huh?!
"
6,13,Stan,"There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
"
6,13,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Oh man, I can't wait to see this!
"
6,13,Kyle,"Dude, that video is making people act strange.
"
6,13,Cartman,"The one tape must be returned!  Run! 
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Get 'em! 
"
6,13,Chris,"Oh, hello, Randy, Sharon.
"
6,13,Randy,"Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?
"
6,13,Linda,"No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs.
"
6,13,Sharon,"Oh, dear!
"
6,13,Chris,"What's the matter?
"
6,13,Randy,"We...  Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. 
"
6,13,Linda,"Ohh Godd!! 
"
6,13,Chris,"Butters?
"
6,13,Linda,"Butters?  Butters!
"
6,13,Butters,"The precious?  Could you bring back my precious?
"
6,13,Chris,"Butters, where is the movie you were watching?
"
6,13,Butters,"They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
"
6,13,Randy,"The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.
"
6,13,Sharon,"Oh, no. 
"
6,13,Kyle,"We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
"
6,13,Cartman,"I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"I smell fourth graders!
"
6,13,Stan,"Oh crap, dude!
"
6,13,Kyle,"Hide! 
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 2,"Hey.  I think I see something down the hill. 
"
6,13,Stan,"Ogh. 
"
6,13,Kyle,"Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
"
6,13,Stan,"Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 
"
6,13,Randy,"And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.
"
6,13,Sheila,"Oh God, this, this is horrible!
"
6,13,Gerald,"All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?
"
6,13,Randy,"I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9. 
"
6,13,Gerald/Chris,"Backdoor Sluts 9?!?
"
6,13,Linda,"Is that bad?
"
6,13,Chris,"Backdoor Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!
"
6,13,Gerald,"I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made. 
"
6,13,Sheila,"How the hell do you know?!
"
6,13,Gerald,"I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People.
"
6,13,Sheila,"Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?!
"
6,13,Sharon,"We're sorry.
"
6,13,Liane,"Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film.
"
6,13,Sheila,"Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!
"
6,13,Randy,"It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?
"
6,13,Butters,"Precious.  Let me see my precious.  Plee-ee-ee-ease! 
"
6,13,Cartman,"Open.  Bellog. 
"
6,13,Clyde,"What do you guys want?
"
6,13,Stan,"We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
"
6,13,Clyde,"Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you?
"
6,13,Kyle,"We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.
"
6,13,Clyde,"So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.
"
6,13,Stan,"Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 
"
6,13,Cartman,"We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
"
6,13,Clyde,"Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.
"
6,13,Clyde,"Faragon, asshole! 
"
6,13,Cartman,"Clyde's a dick.
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Alright, everybody listen up! There's three snot-nosed little fourth graders out there who have a porno called Backdoor Sluts 9.
"
6,13,Other Sixth Graders,"Ooooooh!
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"I checked it out on the Internet, and it said that Backdoor Sluts 9 is the most hard-core porno ever made.
"
6,13,Other Sixth Graders,"Ahhhhh!
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"I have amassed this army of sixth graders to get the tape by any means necessary. Now, let's go get that porno! 
"
6,13,Clyde,"And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please? 
"
6,13,Other boys,"Ahhh.
"
6,13,Jimmy,"That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f-...forces.
"
6,13,Craig,"It could hold a mental spell of some kind.
"
6,13,Kevin,"Perhaps we could use it to strengthen our star cruisers. 
"
6,13,Cartman,"Kevin, god-damnit..! 
"
6,13,Clyde,"Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody.
"
6,13,Stan,"But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
"
6,13,Clyde,"That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black.
"
6,13,Token,"I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape,  just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me.  The fate of Middle-earth... is in my hands. 
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Fourth graders! Give us that porn-o! 
"
6,13,Sharon,"Boys? 
"
6,13,Sheila,"Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. 
"
6,13,Cartman,"Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. 
"
6,13,Clyde,"What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? 
"
6,13,Token,"I'm not playing anymore. 
"
6,13,Stan,"Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see?
"
6,13,Token,"I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. 
"
6,13,Cartman,"My God, this thing must really be powerful. 
"
6,13,Kyle,"This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
"
6,13,Stan,"What do we do with it?
"
6,13,Clyde,"One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. This must be returned to the video store from whence it came.
"
6,13,Jimmy,"Well, where is the videotape rented from?
"
6,13,Kyle,"Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.
"
6,13,Tweek,"Conifer? Walking there would take hours!
"
6,13,Clyde,"There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!
"
6,13,Kindergartner,"I'll go.
"
6,13,Clyde,"Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. 
"
6,13,Craig,"You're too young.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Quiet!
"
6,13,Jimmy,"You guys, this is stupid.
"
6,13,Cartman,"You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
"
6,13,Stan,"I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.
"
6,13,Clyde,"It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard , the dwarf , the warrior , the cleric , and the Jew .
"
6,13,Kyle,"Paladin!
"
6,13,Clyde,"Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.
"
6,13,Tweek,"Me too.
"
6,13,Other boys,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"
6,13,Craig,"Only the six of us are to go?
"
6,13,Stan,"No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
"
6,13,Cartman,"Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us.  Shut up, Kenny.
"
6,13,Narrator,"So it was that the heroes traveled many miles to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
"
6,13,Kyle,"We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
"
6,13,Craig,"Look out! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"We were almost killed.
"
6,13,Cartman,"A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
"
6,13,Stan,"True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
"
6,13,Token's Father,"Oh. Hello everybody.
"
6,13,Gerald,"Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago.
"
6,13,Token's Mother,"Well yes, I believe they were, but they've gone. What's the matter?
"
6,13,Randy,"We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape.
"
6,13,Steve,"What? But Token's never seen a porno before. He wouldn't know what to—Oh God! 
"
6,13,Token's Mother,"Token! 
"
6,13,Token's Mother,"Token? Did the boys come over and... show you a movie? 
"
6,13,Steve,"Token?  Alright, Token. We know you must be very confused about what you saw. 
"
6,13,Randy,"Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse.  Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.
"
6,13,Token,"...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too?  Five midgets, spanking a man... covered in Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love?
"
6,13,Steve,"Jesus, what kind of porno is that?
"
6,13,Gerald,"It was Backdoor Sluts 9.
"
6,13,Steve,"Oh, Jesus, not that one! 
"
6,13,Sheila,"Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid.
"
6,13,Gerald,"Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?
"
6,13,Craig,"We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close.
"
6,13,Stan,"Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
"
6,13,Kindergartner,"Ringworms are no match for a dwarf.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the--
"
6,13,Boy 1,"I shall put the magic spell on you!
"
6,13,Boy 2,"I have blocked your spell, wizard!
"
6,13,Kyle,"Hey, what are you guys doing? 
"
6,13,Boy 3,"We're playing Harry Potter.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Ha!! Fags! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"You guys. Somebody is following us.
"
6,13,Cartman,"It's Butters.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Butters?
"
6,13,Cartman,"Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. 
"
6,13,Butters,"The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
"
6,13,Jimmy,"Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?
"
6,13,Cartman,"There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! 
"
6,13,Jimmy,"They are coming.  You guys go on ahead.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Jimmy, are you sure?
"
6,13,Jimmy,"Go!  You shall not...pah..? You shall not..puh...  You shall not paah...  You shall not pa--!  You shall not paah--!  You shall not puh-uh-uh--  You shall not pass. 
"
6,13,Stan,"Jimmy didn't stop them!
"
6,13,Kyle,"They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
"
6,13,Craig,"What? That's stupid.
"
6,13,Cartman,"I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!
"
6,13,Craig,"Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids. 
"
6,13,Kindergartner,"Me too. 
"
6,13,Cartman,"Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
"
6,13,Stan,"Just get across the river! They're coming! 
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"What the hell is wrong with you guys?! Get the tape!
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 4,"Dude, I don't wanna get wet.
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 5,"Yeah, I don't really like the water.
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 2,"Besides, if our bikes get wet, their chains'll rust.
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Oh, god-damnit. Alright, come on. We'll find a bridge. 
"
6,13,Narrator,"The quest continued to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
"
6,13,Stan,"Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
"
6,13,Cartman,"We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are!  That's what ""lost"" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!
"
6,13,Stan,"This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
"
6,13,Butters,"The Butters knowses.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Oh brother!
"
6,13,Butters,"The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
"
6,13,Stan,"Where?!
"
6,13,Butters,"First, just let Butters sseee the precious.
"
6,13,Kyle,"No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
"
6,13,Cartman,"If that was possible.
"
6,13,Stan,"Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
"
6,13,Butters,"Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. 
"
6,13,Sheila,"This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!
"
6,13,Gerald,"Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context.
"
6,13,Sharon,"Look! There's one of the boys now!  Jimmy!
"
6,13,Randy,"Jimmy! Jimmy!  Where did the boys go with the porno tape?
"
6,13,Jimmy,"They're taking it to the vi... the vi... the vii...
"
6,13,Chris,"Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time.
"
6,13,Jimmy,"They took it back to the video s... the video s...
"
6,13,Randy,"The video sandwich?
"
6,13,Chris,"The video stockyard.
"
6,13,Randy,"What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?
"
6,13,Jimmy,"No, the video suh... the video s...tih...
"
6,13,Gerald,"Stinger?
"
6,13,Chris,"Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?
"
6,13,Jimmy,"N-n-no, you retards! The video s...tore!
"
6,13,Adults,"The video store! 
"
6,13,Sheila,"Hurry! Hurry!
"
6,13,Randy,"I know where it is! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"Oh no! They're closed!
"
6,13,Stan,"Closed?
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"There they are!
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 6,"Don't let them turn it back into the video store!
"
6,13,Cartman,"We're screwed.
"
6,13,Stan,"Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
"
6,13,Kyle,"Finally.  It's over.
"
6,13,Butters,"Precious. Must have our precious. Waagh! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"Butters! No!
"
6,13,Butters,"Now wees hases it! 
"
6,13,Stan,"They're coming!
"
6,13,Kyle,"It has to go back!
"
6,13,Butters,"It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"There it is! Give me that tape! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"Let go of the tape, Butters!
"
6,13,Butters,"I'll never let go! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"Fine! 
"
6,13,Butters,"Precious! 
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Nooo!  No, nooo!  Damnit! 
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 2,"Aw man, now we'll never see the hot action.
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"You stupid little fourth graders!
"
6,13,Cartman,"The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Middle-earth is again safe.
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Yeah? Well, that's not gonna stop us from kicking your asses!
"
6,13,Stan,"Uh-oh.
"
6,13,Randy,"Boys! Boys!
"
6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Crap! Parents!  Come on, guys.  We'll see you next time, fourthies!
"
6,13,Cartman,"And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
"
6,13,Randy,"There you are!
"
6,13,Sheila,"Oh, Kyle! You're safe!
"
6,13,Stan,"Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
"
6,13,Randy,"A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called ""69ing"" and it's normal.
"
6,13,Sharon,"See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it.
"
6,13,Sheila,"That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle.
"
6,13,Gerald,"Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.
"
6,13,Randy,"That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
"
6,13,Sheila,"It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.
"
6,13,Randy,"Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.
"
6,13,Gerald,"Okay, boys. Do you have any questions? 
"
6,13,Stan,"...Wow. 
"
6,13,Randy,"Well, let's all get going.
"
6,13,Sheila,"Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home. 
"
6,13,Chris,"Wait a minute. Where's Butters?
"
6,13,Butters,"Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"I'm aware of that.
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Wow, that's... really great to hear.
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, for real? You're not kidding?
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, this is all just... this is a dream come true!  Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"I know you will. 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow.
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"It's for real, Mr. Garrison.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh-ho, great!
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Right uh-  Wha- ...what was that?
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly?
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Yeh-you don't say.  Well thanks, uh, Principal Victoria.  Holy Moly! I've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay!
"
6,14,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik. 
"
6,14,Kyle,"Funny.
"
6,14,Mr. Mackey,"BUT... the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place. So I want you all to give your best behavior to your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison. 
"
6,14,Kids,"AWWWW!!!
"
6,14,Kyle,"Not him!
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey.
"
6,14,Mr. Mackey,"Good luck, m'kay.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is  Mr. Garrison.
"
6,14,Butters,"Where is Mr. Hat, sir?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.
"
6,14,Kyle,"Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to...  Mr. Slave. 
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Hi kids. Hm.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"So that's  Mr. Slave.  The teacher's assistant.  Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass.
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Oh Jesus Christ.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you. 
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Ugh.
"
6,14,Cartman,"Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"I'm not saying the rest of the school year will be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard.  Really long and really hard. 
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Oh Jesus Christ.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. 
"
6,14,Cartman,"No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...
"
6,14,Cartman,"Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!
"
6,14,Cartman,"No, it was Kenny!
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead!
"
6,14,Stan,"Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
"
6,14,The Other Kids,"Yeah.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishment!  Take it Mr. Slave! 
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Oh-oh. Oh it hurts.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"I will  NOT put up with  TOM foolery in my  CLASS room, children.  Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth.  Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll get me fired for sure. 
"
6,14,Gerald,"I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.
"
6,14,Linda,"Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.
"
6,14,Randy,"Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. 
"
6,14,Gerald,"So full of metaphor.
"
6,14,Kyle,"Hey guys, can we talk to you? 
"
6,14,Sheila,"Oh, hi boys.
"
6,14,Sharon,"How was school?
"
6,14,Kyle,"Uhh, not cool.
"
6,14,Sheila,"That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?
"
6,14,Linda,"Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? 
"
6,14,Stan,"No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
"
6,14,Chris,"Uh huh.
"
6,14,Kyle,"Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
"
6,14,Sheila,"Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!
"
6,14,Stan,"Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.
"
6,14,Randy,"Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were.
"
6,14,Sharon,"Yeah, but Dad-
"
6,14,Randy,"No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!
"
6,14,Sheila,"That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! 
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"Welcome to the Museum of Tolerance. Here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in America. 
"
6,14,Cartman,"Ey!
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"Now, did you know that words we use can show intolerance?  Let's begin our tour with a walk through our Tunnel of Prejudice, to show you what it can feel like to be discriminated against. 
"
6,14,Voice,"QUEER. BEANER. CHINK. NIGGER. HEEB. FAGGOT. CRACKER. SLOPE. 
"
6,14,Cartman,"Aw man, this is awesome! 
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"Now you know how it feels.
"
6,14,Cartman,"I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes. These wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labeled minorities.  Here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts the African-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here? 
"
6,14,Randy,"Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist. 
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"That's right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don't we, kids?
"
6,14,Butters,"W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. 
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like ""All Asians are good at math"" is harmful to society.
"
6,14,Cartman,"Look, a covetous Jew!
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed.
"
6,14,Randy,"Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical ""sleepy Mexican."" 
"
6,14,Janitor,"Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it? 
"
6,14,Randy,"Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.
"
6,14,Janitor,"Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tired. Ongh, so sleepy. 
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays , because you see, being tolerant you must also respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight,  like this young man here.
"
6,14,Cartman,"Ey!
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"You other boys have probably called this young man names like ""tubby,"" or ""lardbutt,"" or ""fat tits,""...
"
6,14,Kyle,"""Fat tits."" That's a good one.
"
6,14,Stan,"Yeah, I have to remember that.
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"But you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice.
"
6,14,Cartman,"I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.
"
6,14,Cartman,"Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! 
"
6,14,Randy,"That's our Cartman. 
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"Well, that's the end of our tour.
"
6,14,Randy,"Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?
"
6,14,Stan,"I guess.
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"We have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do.  Hey! What the hell are you doing? 
"
6,14,Smoker,"Oh I was just uh-
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"There's no smoking in the museum!
"
6,14,Smoker,"But I'm not in the museum.
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"Get out of here, you filthy smoker! 
"
6,14,Gerald,"Yeah, dirty lungs!
"
6,14,Sharon,"Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath!
"
6,14,Chris,"Dumbass!
"
6,14,Richard,"Get out of here! 
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"Well, have a great day, everybody.
"
6,14,Chris,"Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?
"
6,14,The Boys,"Yeah.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today.  Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?
"
6,14,Butters,"It evaporates.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react.  Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please.  Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass.  The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"AAH.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?
"
6,14,Butters,"Sure. 
"
6,14,Stan,"Oh, no, no, no no no no.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass?  Well let's see. 
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"AAH.  AAH.  Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!
"
6,14,Butters,"Lemmiwinks? NO!
"
6,14,Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
6,14,The Boys,"Hey Chef.
"
6,14,Chef,"How's it goin'?
"
6,14,Kyle,"Bad.
"
6,14,Chef,"Why bad?
"
6,14,Stan,"Chef, we're intolerant. 
"
6,14,Chef,"...Intolerant of who?
"
6,14,Kyle,"Gays, I guess.
"
6,14,Chef,"Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children?  I thought you knew better.
"
6,14,Stan,"Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.
"
6,14,Chef,"Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, ""What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?""
"
6,14,Kyle,"Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
"
6,14,Chef,"Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!
"
6,14,Stan,"Are we homophobes now?
"
6,14,Kyle,"We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.
"
6,14,Chef,"Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??
"
6,14,Stan,"N-no?
"
6,14,Chef,"You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.
"
6,14,Cartman,"I'll take three lunches today, please.
"
6,14,Chef,"You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!
"
6,14,Cartman,"It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave.  Now we'll get fired for sure!
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass.
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Garrison to the principal's office, please?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! Twenty-five million here we cooome. 
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh!  Oooooh, Jesus Christ. 
"
6,14,Frog King,"Lemmiwinks, you must find a way out of this place, or you will surely die.  This way has been closed off by the Great Sphincter. To escape you must journey upward to the dark reaches of the intestine and past the stomach.  Who am I? Just a friend. Heed my words, Lemmiwinks. Your time is running out. Make for the large intestine. All will be made clear then. 
"
6,14,Singer,"A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.
Hurry onward, Lemmiwinks, or you will soon be dead.
The journey before you may be long and filled with woe
But you must escape the gay man's ass so your tale can be told.
Lemmiwinks. Lehehemiwinks Lemmiwinks Lemmiwinks-
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired. 
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go.
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"No no no we're not firing you.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"...You're not?
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar.
"
6,14,Chef,"Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words ""sick queer"" to describe his conduct in class?
"
6,14,Chef,"He IS a sick queer!!
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah!
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef.
"
6,14,Chef,"Kiss my black ass!! 
"
6,14,Mr. Mackey,"Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay?
"
6,14,Stan,"We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
"
6,14,Randy,"Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!
"
6,14,Butters,"But they killed Lemmiwinks!
"
6,14,Chris,"Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!
"
6,14,Butters,"Yes sir.
"
6,14,Chris,"Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn.
"
6,14,Mr. Mackey,"Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay?
"
6,14,Sharon,"That sounds good to me.
"
6,14,Liane,"Mee too.
"
6,14,Sheila,"Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp.
"
6,14,Stan,"Tolerance camp?
"
6,14,Camp Warden,"Welcome to tolerance camp. You are here because you would not accept people's differences.  Because you refuse to accept the life choices of your fellow man. Well those days are now over. Here you vill verk, every hour of every day until you submit to being tolerant of everybody. Here, intolerance... will not be tolerated.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"God-damnit!
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"How'd it go?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"The principal didn't fire you?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Oh, Jesus Christ.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody. What you need to do is let the parents see what kind of demented faggot you are.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh well-  Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave.  The parents have to see for themselves.  The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget!
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Oohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ. 
"
6,14,Singers,"Lemmiwinks journeyed a distance far and fast.
To find his way out of a gay man's ass.
The road ahead is filled with danger and fright
But push onward, Lemmiwinks, with all of your might.
"
6,14,Frog King,"Lemmiwinks, you are coming to the entrance of the small intestine. Now you must seek out the Sparrow Prince. 
"
6,14,Singers,"The Sparrow Prince lies somewhere way up ahead.
Don't look back, Lemmiwinks, or you'll soon be dead.
Lemmiwinks, Lemmiwinks, the time is growing late
Slow down now and seal your fate.
"
6,14,Sparrow Prince,"I am the Sparrow Prince. Long has my spirit been trapped within this place. Before you lies the maze of the small intestine. One path leads to the stomach, the other to certain doom. Take with you this helmet and torch.  Let them be your guide. 
"
6,14,Singers,"Take the magic helmet torch to help you light the way.
There's still a lot of ground to cross inside the man so gay.
Ahead of you lies adventure, and your strength still lies within.
Freedom from the Ass of Doom is the treasure you will win.
"
6,14,Camp Warden,"Today we will be using the fingerpaint! You vill make a painting that shows people of different races and sexual orientations getting along. Fingerpaint. Fingerpaint!  You vill not make any distinction between people of different colors! People with different sexual preferences! You vill accept everyone!  What are you fingerpainting?!
"
6,14,Kyle,"Uh, a bear?
"
6,14,Camp Warden,"Ein bear?! Und bear has nothing to do with accepting people of different races!
"
6,14,Kyle,"Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.
"
6,14,Camp Warden,"Start over!  You will fingerpaint what we tell you!  GO!  Faster.  Faster!  Faasterr.
"
6,14,Kyle,"Aaaa! 
"
6,14,Camp Warden,"Faster! Are you done?! What is it?! What have you done?! 
"
6,14,Kyle,"People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
"
6,14,Camp Warden,"GOOD!  That wasn't so hard, was it?  NOW DO IT AGAIN!  Faster!  Faasterr!
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet?
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Almost. I just have to get through a su-  Uh-huc, Jesus Christ.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"What's the matter?
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather. 
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Eugh, Jesus Christ. 
"
6,14,Singers,"Lemmiwinks came to the stomach far.
'Neath the depths of the lungs and heart.
"
6,14,A Catfish,"You chose your path wisely, Lemmiwinks. I am the Catatafish.
"
6,14,Singers,"Catatafish of the stomach's cove.
"
6,14,Catatafish,"If you answer this riddle, the esophagus will let you pass.
"
6,14,Singers,"Catatafish riddle will soom be told.
"
6,14,Camp Warden,"Everything in order?
"
6,14,Camp Soldier,"Yes, mein Führer. Ve are making the prisoners make macaroni pictures that illustrate diversity in the verkplace.
"
6,14,Camp Warden,"Eh-xcellent! 
"
6,14,Kyle,"Oh.
"
6,14,Stan,"Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
"
6,14,Kyle,"Can't... glue... any... more. 
"
6,14,Stan,"The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
"
6,14,Camp Warden,"Take this one away. He is done for. 
"
6,14,Stan,"Butters!
"
6,14,Butters,"No more... arts and crafts...
"
6,14,Stan,"Jesus... we have to get out of here. 
"
6,14,Girl 1,"Please don't tell them that we're hiding here.
"
6,14,Girl 2,"We can't work anymore. We'll die.
"
6,14,Camp Soldier,"Vhat?  Waht?!
"
6,14,Cartman,"Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.
"
6,14,Camp Soldier,"Vhat is in there?
"
6,14,Cartman,"Nothing.
"
6,14,Camp Soldier,"Get back to verk.
"
6,14,Cartman,"Yes sir!  Phew. 
"
6,14,The Girls,"Eww! Eww! Eww! 
"
6,14,Cartman,"Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! 
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"Tonight we are here to honor an amazing fourth grade teacher with the Courageous Teacher award.  Herbert Garrison came out about two years ago. Since then he has faced adversity. He has even faced ridicule by some of the students.
"
6,14,Sharon,"Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.
"
6,14,Tour Guide,"It is my honor to present the Courageous Teacher award to... Herbert Garrison. 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Get along, little Slave.
"
6,14,Randy,"Oh my God.
"
6,14,Gerald,"That's what our boys were talking about?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Ding-ding, ding-ding.
"
6,14,Man 1,"He is so courageous.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Say, Mr. Slave.
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Yes, Mr. Garrison?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"I had a dream last night that you were a real dick.
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Really? Why would you dream that I was being an asshole?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"No no, I was the asshole. 
"
6,14,Man 2,"Ogh, that is so courageous.
"
6,14,Man 3,"What an amazing human being! 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this award. Uh but you know what makes me even happier? Sucking balls.
"
6,14,Audience,"Ahh 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr. Slave.
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"I've got a little- Oof.  Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there?
"
6,14,Frog King,"Hang on, Lemmiwinks! You solved the Catatafish's riddle. Now your trials are nearly through!
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Oh! I should have never shoved all those poor animals up my ass! 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Uh...
"
6,14,Man 4,"Courageous.
"
6,14,Man 5,"So courageous.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"God-damnit, don't you people get it?! I'm trying to get fired here! 
"
6,14,Man 3,"Oh, that's courageous.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Yeah, Jesus Christ.
"
6,14,Man 6,"But the mu-se-um tells us to be to-le-rant
"
6,14,Man 3,"Yes. The mu-se-um.
"
6,14,Man 7,"The mu-se-um tells us.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance!  ""Tolerate"" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!
"
6,14,Randy,"He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.
"
6,14,Gerald,"We'ge gotta get our boys back! 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Ogh! Okay, so now can I PLEASE get fired and get my 25 million dollars?!
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"No, no, I think I have a better idea.
"
6,14,Randy,"We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?
"
6,14,Sheila,"Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered. 
"
6,14,Chris,"Come on, let's go. 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"But this is insane!
"
6,14,Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.
"
6,14,Camp Warden,"Vhat do we have here? Noo recruits? I assure you, the next veek will be nothing but pain and suffering! 
"
6,14,Mr. Slave,"Oooo, this could be kind of fun. 
"
6,14,Singers,"Lemmiwinks has made it out and his tale is nearly through
"
6,14,Catatafish,"Great job, Lemmiwinks.
"
6,14,Sparrow Prince,"Thanks to you we are all free.
"
6,14,Frog King,"But your adventures are just beginning, for you are no ordinary gerbil, Lemmiwinks. You are the Gerbil King. 
"
6,14,The Three Spirits,"All hail the Gerbil King. 
"
6,15,Liane,"Be careful with my baby.
"
6,15,Blonde Nurse,"What have we got?
"
6,15,Paramedic 1,"Not sure. It looks like a possible code five six!
"
6,15,Cartman,"Kenny. Can't have Kenny.
"
6,15,Liane,"You're going to be okay, baby.
"
6,15,Dr. Doctor,"Five me 50 cc's of ketamine, STAT. And get something for the kid, too.
"
6,15,Liane,"Is he going to be okay?
"
6,15,Liane,"Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?
"
6,15,Dr. Doctor,"I'm afraid he's... running out of time.
"
6,15,Liane,"Why?? What's wrong with him??
"
6,15,Dr. Doctor,"It's his time. It's ...running out.
"
6,15,Liane,"Well, what does he need?
"
6,15,Dr. Doctor,"He needs to have more time.
"
6,15,Liane,"What can we do?
"
6,15,Dr. Doctor,"Well, I suppose we could try a time transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist. 
"
6,15,Liane,"It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time.
"
6,15,Cartman,"Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!
"
6,15,Chef,"Hello there, children.
"
6,15,Stan,"Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
"
6,15,Kyle,"Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
"
6,15,Chef,"Well what's wrong with him?
"
6,15,Stan,"Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
"
6,15,Kyle,"Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
"
6,15,Chef,"Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
"
6,15,Kyle,"Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?
"
6,15,Chef,"Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!
"
6,15,Liane,"He's looking a little better today.
"
6,15,Dr. Doctor,"Yes, but his time is still getting weaker. It will give out soon unless we do something. 
"
6,15,Cartman,"Hey you guys! How's it goin'?
"
6,15,Chef,"Cartman?
"
6,15,Stan,"No, that's Kenny.
"
6,15,Cartman,"What the hell are you assholes doing here?!
"
6,15,Stan,"That's Cartman.
"
6,15,Chef,"Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?
"
6,15,Cartman,"Oh, about a month.
"
6,15,Dr. Doctor,"Let's not validate his delusions.
"
6,15,Chef,"Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?
"
6,15,Cartman,"He's gone again.
"
6,15,Chef,"Ms. Cartman, we need to get Cartman to a meeting room to speak with people who have crossed over.
"
6,15,Dr. Doctor,"What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant!
"
6,15,Chef,"This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.
"
6,15,Stan,"Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
"
6,15,Chef,"That's right. We have to go see him in New York.
"
6,15,Dr. Doctor,"I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's time could give out at any minute. He needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored.
"
6,15,Liane,"Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there.
"
6,15,Chef,"Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.
"
6,15,Kyle,"We're gong to New York?
"
6,15,Flight Attendant,"Welcome aboard Flight 673 to New York. We are happy to show you a feature film during the flight. In a moment we'll be showing a preview.
"
6,15,Kyle,"Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
"
6,15,Stan,"Awesome!
"
6,15,Announcer,"Rob Shneider was an animal.  Then he was a woman.  And now Rob Schneider is...  a stapler.  And he's about to find out...  that being a stapler  is harder than it looks. Rob Schneider is... The Stapler.  Rated PG-13
"
6,15,"Stan, Kyle","Weak!
"
6,15,Cartman,"Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me.
"
6,15,Chef,"This must be the place.
"
6,15,Page,"Okay audience members, hi, welcome to the taping of the show.  It's all general seating in there, and just remember, Mr. Edward might not hear from the particular dead person you wanna talk to, so just... keep an open mind.
"
6,15,Chef,"Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you.
"
6,15,Announcer,"Ladies and Gentlemen, John Edward.

"
6,15,Man 1,"Yes. Yeh-yes she did.
"
6,15,John Edward,"Okay, and she's telling me there's something about... the money. That the, the money is safe? Is that making sense? 
"
6,15,Man 1,"M-mm-m. Not really.
"
6,15,John Edward,"Must be from somewhere else in the audience, then. Uh, d'uh, money? Is someone el-
"
6,15,Stan,"Uh, over here please?
"
6,15,Kyle,"We have a dead friend.

6,15,Stan,"We told you that.
"
6,15,John Edward,"And, and this wasn't, this wasn't a good death. It was like a, it was a sad death. It was like a, it was like a death that made people sad. Does that make sense?
"
6,15,Kyle,"Yee-yeah.

6,15,Audience members,"Oh, wow, that's incredible! Wow!
"
6,15,Chef,"Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?
"
6,15,John Edward,"Doesn't work that way.  Now, Kenny is telling me that... you're his best friends, and he's in a ss-safe place.
"
6,15,Stan,"No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.
"
6,15,John Edward,"Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle?
"
6,15,Kyle,"I'm Kyle.
"
6,15,John Edward,"Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma?
"
6,15,Kyle,"Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here?
"
6,15,John Edward,"She says there was something she asked you to do, and you're not doing it? She wants you to look for four white doves.
"
6,15,Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
6,15,John Edward,"Oh now she's sending me a P word. Maybe it's a puh-? Or a huh-?
"
6,15,Woman 1,"My Harry died last year!
"
6,15,John Edward,"Oh, it's comin' from over here.  I'm getting all kinds of voices today.  Woo! 
"
6,15,Stan,"Heh hey wait a minute dude.
"
6,15,John Edward,"Okay now Harry. He's telling me... oh well, he's saying that you two used to... do things.
"
6,15,Woman 1,"Mmm-hmm.
"
6,15,John Edward,"And that those things involved... stuff?
"
6,15,Woman 1,"The things did involve stuff, yes. 
"
6,15,Chef,"Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!
"
6,15,Stan,"He seemed better on TV?
"
6,15,Chef,"Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.
"
6,15,Kyle,"Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.
"
6,15,Stan,"Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 
"
6,15,Liane,"Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out!
"
6,15,Chef,"We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.
"
6,15,Chef,"Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver.
"
6,15,Stan,"We don't get to go to Scotland?
"
6,15,Liane,"It's too far and your parents want you back home.
"
6,15,Stan,"Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
"
6,15,Cartman,"Thanks, asshole.
"
6,15,Chef,"Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now.
"
6,15,Announcer,"This is the final boarding announcement for Flight 342 to Denver.

6,15,Stan,"That's us. Come on.
"
6,15,Kyle,"Four white birds!
"
6,15,Stan,"Huh?
"
6,15,Kyle,"There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
"
6,15,Stan,"Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
"
6,15,Kyle,"So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
"
6,15,Stan,"Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 
"
6,15,Kyle,"I'm not going back.
"
6,15,Stan,"What??
"
6,15,Kyle,"I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 
"
6,15,Stan,"Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! 
"
6,15,Stan,"Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
"
6,15,Butler,"He doesn't do private readings.
"
6,15,Stan,"I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
"
6,15,Butler,"Alright, come on in. 
"
6,15,Butler,"Just wait here. I'll go fetch him. 
"
6,15,Stan,"Jesus Christ.

"
6,15,Prerecorded Voice,"Ladies and Gentlemen, John Edward. 
"
6,15,John Edward,"Thank you, thank you.
"
6,15,Stan,"Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
"
6,15,John Edward,"Oh.  The John Edward show is not liable for opinions and materials given for entertainment purposes only. 
"
6,15,Stan,"Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
"
6,15,John Edward,"Maybe it is for real.
"
6,15,Stan,"Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.
"
6,15,John Edward,"Look, people have the right to be skeptical. I really hear voices in my head.
"
6,15,Stan,"Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called ""intuition."" Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
"
6,15,John Edward,"Look, what I do doesn't hurt anybody. I give people closure and help them cope with life.
"
6,15,Stan,"No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
"
6,15,John Edward,"But I'm a psychic.
"
6,15,Stan,"No dude, you're a douche.
"
6,15,John Edward,"I'm not a douche! What if I really believe that dead people talk to me?
"
6,15,Stan,"Then you're a stupid douche
"
6,15,John Edward,"I think I've had of your bullying me! Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs, lock myself in my panic room and call the police!
"
6,15,Stan,"I'm nine years old.
"
6,15,John Edward,"I'm not talking to your friend and I'm not a douche!  You'd better get out of my house, 'cause I'm gonna call the police! 
"
6,15,Stan,"You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 
"
6,15,Cartman,"Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
"
6,15,Liane,"Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon.
"
6,15,Pilot,"Welcome aboard Scotland Air. Our trip to Edinburgh should take about twelve hours.
"
6,15,Cartman,"Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!

6,15,Stan,"Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
"
6,15,Kyle,"He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
"
6,15,Stan,"Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called ""cold reading."" They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
"
6,15,Man 2,"Hey, whoa now. John Edward is for real.
"
6,15,Stan,"No, he's not.
"
6,15,Woman 2,"Yeah. My sister told me he knew our mother's name and when she died. 
"
6,15,Construction Worker,"John Edward? Oh yeah, I heard he walked up to a guy on the street, and said his dead father wanted to say ""Happy Birthday,"" and it WAS his birthday.
"
6,15,Woman 3,"Yeah kid, how do you explain that?
"
6,15,Stan,"Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
"
6,15,Woman 4,"Oh-ho. Me? 
"
6,15,Stan,"Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
"
6,15,Woman 4,"Okay.
"
6,15,Stan,"Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
"
6,15,Woman 4,"My father?
"
6,15,Stan,"Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
"
6,15,Woman 4,"My birthday's in November!
"
6,15,Stan,"Right, because he's saying, ""Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'""
"
6,15,Woman 4,"Oh my God.
"
6,15,Stan,"See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
"
6,15,Man 2,"Well then how'd you know her birthday was in November?
"
6,15,Stan,"I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday.""
"
6,15,Woman 4,"What else does he say?
"
6,15,Stan,"Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money.""
"
6,15,Woman 4,"Oh my God! My sister and I have been fighting over his inheritance.
"
6,15,Woman 3,"That's amazing.
"
6,15,Stan,"No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
"
6,15,Man 3,"That sounds a little too coincidental.
"
6,15,Man 4,"Yes. There's only one explanation. This kid can communicate with the dead!
"
6,15,Adults,"Wow!
"
6,15,Stan,"What?! 
"
6,15,Man 2,"Do me next. I wanna talk to my mother.
"
6,15,Woman 3,"Can you try to reach my grandfather.
"
6,15,Stan,"No wait.
"
6,15,Construction Worker,"You have to tell me if my sister's in a good place. 
"
6,15,Man 5,"Yeah, help me out too, 'k?
"
6,15,Man 6,"I'm next. I'm next.
"
6,15,Man 7,"Hey, get out of my way!
"
6,15,Man 8,"Do me!
"
6,15,Scout,"Kid, how would you like your own talking to the dead show?
"
6,15,Chef,"Hi Pop.
"
6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Junior! Aw, son, it's good to see you now.
"
6,15,Chef,"These are my friends, the Cartmans. 
"
6,15,Thomas,"Well come on in out of the cold now.  There's heavy fog on the moors tonight.  Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nelly.
"
6,15,Nelly,"Oh, my baby come home!
"
6,15,Chef,"Hi, Momma! 
"
6,15,Nelly,"Lord, I thought you wasn't comin' till nine.
"
6,15,Chef,"Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman.
"
6,15,Liane,"Please, call me Liane.
"
6,15,Nelly,"So nice to have you here, Liane.
"
6,15,Thomas,"And is this the children you told us about?
"
6,15,Chef,"Yeah, Pop. This is Eric.
"
6,15,Thomas,"Well, let's see here now.  Mhm, mhm, mhm.  Yeup! There's definitely more than one children in there.
"
6,15,Liane,"Oh dear.
"
6,15,Thomas,"Nelly, you best have at it now.
"
6,15,Nelly,"Oh Lord, and I just put the roast in the oven, too.  Ain't gonna have no time now to baste it. Don't nobody blame me, a woman can't bake no roast and do everything else at the same time.  Can't say that the roast is gonna be terrible, maybe just a little dry.  But I suppose we can make some extra gravy to take the dryness out later. 
"
6,15,Thomas,"Alright, children, stand up on this chair now.
"
6,15,Cartman,"Right now?
"
6,15,Thomas,"Yes, right now. 
"
6,15,Nelly,"Na kamaa karash meh nah- 
"
6,15,Cartman,"Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.
"
6,15,Nelly,"Come out now. Come out now.
"
6,15,Thomas,"Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing.
"
6,15,Nelly,"You all come out of there now.
"
6,15,Announcer,"At a vary young age one young boy learned he had a special gift. This is ""The Other Side."" 
"
6,15,Stan,"Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
"
6,15,Woman 5,"Yes! Yes, my Peter! 
"
6,15,Audience,"Wow!! 
"
6,15,Stan,"No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, ""Peter was your husband?""
"
6,15,Woman 5,"Yes, yes! Yes, my husband Peter!
"
6,15,Audience,"Wow!! 
"
6,15,Woman 6,"Oh wow!
"
6,15,Stan,"Stop it! I didn't do anything!
"
6,15,Man 9,"You knew Peter was dead!
"
6,15,Stan,"I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, ""They want me to acknowledge Peter."" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, ""I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely""
"
6,15,Woman 6,"Yes, it was.
"
6,15,Audience,"Wow!! 
"
6,15,Man 10,"Amazing!
"
6,15,Woman 7,"Ask Peter if he knows my little Billy.
"
6,15,Stan,"Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally!
"
6,15,Thomas,"In the name of all that is holy we command this spirit be set free!
"
6,15,Cartman,"Ahh, Aahhhh! 
"
6,15,Thomas,"There we go! We're gettin' somethin' now!
"
6,15,Nelly,"Come on out, spirit. Go!
"
6,15,Thomas,"Come on out hyow! It's safe!  Here it comes! The spirit is comin' out hyuh! 
"
6,15,Nelly,"Oooo, that's the potatoes. 
"
6,15,Thomas,"Well hold on the potatoes two seconds, woman!  The soul's comin' out hyuh!  It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child!
"
6,15,Chef,"The victim child?
"
6,15,Thomas,"Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we could Kenny's soul into its body. 
"
6,15,Nelly,"Oh Lord, they didn't bring a victim child.
"
6,15,Chef,"Where were we gonna find a child to secrifice?
"
6,15,Nelly,"We weren't gonna ask you where you got it from. 
"
6,15,Thomas,"God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go!
"
6,15,Nelly,"Lord, Thomas, don't let it get on the curtains.

"
6,15,Stan,"Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
"
6,15,Kyle,"You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
"
6,15,Stan,"Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! 
"
6,15,John Edward,"So, you think you can talk to dead people better than me, huh?!
"
6,15,Stan,"No, I don't think either of us can. 
"
6,15,John Edward,"They told me your show is getting better ratings than mine, that you're saying I'm a fraud on your show! You'd better not ever call me a liar, or a fake, or a douche again, or else I'll sue you for slander!
"
6,15,Stan,"I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
"
6,15,John Edward,"Everything I tell people is positive and gives them hope! How does that make me a douche?!
"
6,15,Stan,"Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
"
6,15,John Edward,"I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to the world that I'm psychic and you're not!
"
6,15,Stan,"Fine, douche! 
"
6,15,John Edward,"I'm not a douche 
"
6,15,Thomas,"Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now.  It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light.
"
6,15,Nelly,"I'll open a window, you try to chase it out, Thomas.
"
6,15,Thomas,"Go on now, soul now!
"
6,15,Nelly,"Here, spirit, come out the window.  I'll give you tree-fiddy. 
"
6,15,Thomas,"Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!
"
6,15,Nelly,"I'm just tryin' to persuade it.
"
6,15,Thomas,"Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin'  Aw Christmas, there it goes again!
"
6,15,Nelly,"It's headin' for the kitchen! Aw, Thomas, the pot roast! 
"
6,15,Thomas,"Over here!
"
6,15,Liane,"Get it down.
"
6,15,Nelly,"Don't let it get in the roast! 
"
6,15,Thomas,"Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.
"
6,15,Chef,"What do we do with it now?
"
6,15,Nelly,"Well I'll wrap it up with some plastic wrap so you can take it home with ya. Should last a few months in the freezer. 
"
6,15,Cartman,"Hey, ah I feel a lot better.
"
6,15,Chef,"Eric, you're okay! 
"
6,15,Liane,"Oh, baby, your time is back!
"
6,15,Nelly,"This child is clean.
"
6,15,Announcer,"Ladies and Gentlemen, it's ""Psychic Showdown."" Here are John Edward, and Stan Marsh. 
"
6,15,John Edward,"Thank you.  Alright, asshole! I know you're here to try to throw me off, so go ahead. Give my your best shot!
"
6,15,Stan,"No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
"
6,15,John Edward,"Wah-why?
"
6,15,Stan,"You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. 
"
6,15,Audience Members,"Yes. Right. Yeah. 
"
6,15,Kyle,"You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
"
6,15,Stan,"Yeah.
"
6,15,John Edward,"But I do have a special power! I know I do!
"
6,15,Stan,"There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
"
6,15,John Edward,"God-damnit, I'm special!!

6,15,Liane,"Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie.

6,15,Liane,"I thought you got it.

6,16,Kyle,"Throw it away, Clyde!
"
6,16,Clyde,"I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.
"
6,16,Stan,"What's going on?
"
6,16,Kyle,"Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
"
6,16,Stan,"So throw it away.
"
6,16,Clyde,"Nobody wants to touch it.
"
6,16,Kyle,"What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
"
6,16,Craig,"Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?
"
6,16,Clyde,"And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?
"
6,16,Stan,"You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.
"
6,16,Token,"How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before.
"
6,16,Jimmy,"Well, I did Ecstasy once.  Me and my girlfriend took it and we stayed up all night having... sex. 
"
6,16,Kyle,"...Where did you have sex with her?
"
6,16,Jimmy,"In her... va-vagina.  Thank you, thank you. What a terrific audience.
"
6,16,Stan,"It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Then you throw it away, smartass. 
"
6,16,Stan,"Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.
"
6,16,Ozzy,"You kids  don't  around with your  mom!

6,16,Jack,"Dad, we ing can't! It's a big ick a 
"
6,16,Sharon,"Stan, what did I tell you about watching The Osbournes?
"
6,16,Stan,"Aw, come on, Mom.
"
6,16,Sharon,"It's going to make you retarded! 
"
6,16,Stan,"It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
"
6,16,Grandpa Marvin,"Oh goody. Now we can watch the news.
"
6,16,Tom,"In other news, South Park police are still looking for a craaazy man who terrorized the town one hour ago.  The man claimed to be from the future and ran naked through the city streets screaming ""The past! The past! Oh my God, it's the past!"" Which is what one would expect someone in the future to yell. 
"
6,16,Naked Man,"Oh my God, it's the past!  Oh, whoa man, it's you!
"
6,16,Sharon,"Who are you?
"
6,16,Naked Man,"It's me, Mom, your son Stan. 
"
6,16,Randy,"Who is it, Sharon?
"
6,16,Naked Man,"Dad!
"
6,16,Randy,"Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
"
6,16,Stan,"Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?
"
6,16,Naked Man,"No way, it's me from the past! 
"
6,16,Stan,"I'm me from the past?
"
6,16,Future Stan,"No, I'm you from the future!  Oh man, this is so messed up.
"
6,16,Randy,"Okay, we've had enough!
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Your name's Randy Marsh, you're a geologist, and you don't like chicken. Mom, your maiden name is Kimble and you have a scar on your left knee from when you slipped in the swimming pool.
"
6,16,Sharon,"Randy, what's going on?
"
6,16,Randy,"I don't know.
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Dude, just let me talk to you for like, five minutes. After that I'll bail.
"
6,16,Future Stan,"I can still remember when I was five and you both found that squirrel I'd been keeping in the closet and, you let me keep it for another week and then it ran away but... I know that's just what you told me. I know that Mom had actually let it out.
"
6,16,Randy,"How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
"
6,16,Sharon,"But why are you back in this time with us, son?
"
6,16,Future Stan,"I have no idea, man. I was just about to go asleep in an alley behind the crackhouse,  and I shot up a little heroin, and then this electrical storm started. Next thing I knew I was running around in my own past, man. I thought... I was just tripping, but then I came down and I was still here. Oh, dude, it's so bizarre!
"
6,16,Stan,"Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
"
6,16,Randy,"Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.
"
6,16,Sharon,"That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift.
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Thanks. Can I get another beer?
"
6,16,Sharon,"You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?
"
6,16,Future Stan,"That'd be killer. Where can I crash?
"
6,16,Sharon,"Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind his room, would you, Stan?
"
6,16,Stan,"What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! 
"
6,16,Singer,"Here we are, face to face, ""My Future Self -n- Me"" 
"
6,16,Stan,"Stop it.
"
6,16,Singer,"So much alike, and yet so different
"
6,16,Stan,"No.
"
6,16,Singer,"One of them's messy, the other one's clean!
Gettin' along isn't always easy, sometimes we disagree
"
6,16,Stan,"Quit it.
"
6,16,Singer,"But in the end we know we're good for each other

"
6,16,Stan,"Hey guys.
"
6,16,"Kyle, Cartman","Hey.
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Whoa, Kyle and Cartman! It's so cool to see you guys.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Who's this asshole?
"
6,16,Stan,"This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
"
6,16,Kyle,"Wow. That's pretty cool.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Then how does he know our names?
"
6,16,Kyle,"'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Yeah, I spent a lot of my teenage years on a slow downward spiral experimenting with drugs and alcohol. 
"
6,16,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
6,16,Cartman,"That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!
"
6,16,Kyle,"Hey, what happens to me in the future?
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Oh, I don't know. You guys stayed away from drugs, so you're okay. I just lost touch with you after I was sent to Juvi Hall in 2006.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! 
"
6,16,Stan,"God-damnit!
"
6,16,Stan,"Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
"
6,16,Butters,"Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?
"
6,16,Stan,"I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
"
6,16,Butters,"Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
"
6,16,Stan,"I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
"
6,16,Butters,"I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
"
6,16,Stan,"Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?
"
6,16,Butters,"I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 
"
6,16,Stan,"Dude, how long has your future self been around?
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
"
6,16,Stan,"Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
"
6,16,Butters,"Nobody asked.
"
6,16,Stan,"Where is he now?
"
6,16,Butters,"Probably watching Becker.
"
6,16,Becker,"My name is T. Becker. The T stand for Terrific. 
"
6,16,Butters,"See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
"
6,16,Future Butters,"Stan! Sure I remember you. Yep. Wearing that puff-ball hat like always.
"
6,16,Linda,"Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine.
"
6,16,Stan,"Liver medicine?
"
6,16,Butters,"Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan? 
"
6,16,Stan,"Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!
"
6,16,Butters,"Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?
"
6,16,Stan,"Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 
"
6,16,Butters,"Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.
"
6,16,Stan,"Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?
"
6,16,Butters,"I don't follow.
"
6,16,Stan,"Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh! Are we out for an adventure? 
"
6,16,Stan,"Here it is. Motivation Corp. 
"
6,16,Butters,"I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
"
6,16,Stan,"Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? 
"
6,16,Stan,"What the hell is going on here?
"
6,16,A voice,"It should take about a month to achieve the results you want.  Well, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks, I think you're going to be very pleased with the results.
"
6,16,Mr. Brooks,"We sure hope so. We just don't know how to talk to our son about drugs.
"
6,16,Director,"Well now you won't have to! Ah, here he is. This is Josh Casher. He'll be playing the role of your future son.
"
6,16,Josh,"Nice to meet you, ""Mom and Dad."" 
"
6,16,Mrs. Brooks,"My goodness, he does look a little like Kevin.
"
6,16,Director,"Yes, and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house. And he's worked up quite a future for your son.
"
6,16,Mr. Casher,"I'm going to tell him that I dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years, where I was sodomized. In the ass.
"
6,16,Mrs. Brooks,"Woohoo, that should get Kevin to stay clear of drugs.
"
6,16,Mr. Brooks,"Heh it sure should, heh.
"
6,16,Director,"Alright, then we'll put the fake news report out on Tuesday night. Make sure your son is watching the Channel 4 News.
"
6,16,Mr. Brooks,"Oh, and that's when uh you'll fake the electrical storm as well?
"
6,16,Director,"Motivation Corp. takes care of everything.  Just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives.
"
6,16,Mrs. Brooks,"""Listen to me, you crazy person, there's no way you can be from the future."" Oh this is going to be fun.
"
6,16,Stan,"I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
"
6,16,Butters,"Yeah, I can't believe it!
"
6,16,Stan,"They've all been lying to us this whole time!
"
6,16,Butters,"This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
"
6,16,Stan,"Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
"
6,16,Butters,"Eh, but then why did they come back to the past
"
6,16,Stan,"They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'
"
6,16,Stan,"It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
"
6,16,Butters,"Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!
"
6,16,Stan,"Who's that?
"
6,16,Butters,"You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
"
6,16,Stan,"What?
"
6,16,Butters,"Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 
"
6,16,Butters,"Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. 
"
6,16,Stan,"We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
"
6,16,Butters,"Now you know my terrible secret!
"
6,16,Stan,"...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
"
6,16,Butters,"Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.
"
6,16,Stan,"But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 
"
6,16,Butters,"Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.
"
6,16,Butters,"How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
"
6,16,Stan,"No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.
"
6,16,Butters,"Wow, look at this, Stan.  ""Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed.""
"
6,16,Stan,"Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 
"
6,16,Butters,"Hey look, somebody lost their pet.
"
6,16,Stan,"Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
"
6,16,Butters,"Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.
"
6,16,Stan,"Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
"
6,16,Butters,"This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
"
6,16,Stan,"Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
"
6,16,Butters,"Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.
"
6,16,Stan,"Fine, then you can come with me. 
"
6,16,Butters,"Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.
"
6,16,Stan,"I guess this is it.
"
6,16,Stan,"Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
"
6,16,Cartman,"Yes, come in, please. 
"
6,16,Stan,"Cartman??
"
6,16,Cartman,"Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.
"
6,16,Stan,"What the hell are you doing here?!
"
6,16,Cartman,"I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?
"
6,16,Butters,"You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
"
6,16,Stan,"God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 
"
6,16,Cartman,"Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?
"
6,16,Stan,"Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
"
6,16,Cartman,"That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.
"
6,16,Stan,"How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. 
"
6,16,Stan,"Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
"
6,16,Cartman,"God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?
"
6,16,Butters,"Yeah!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.
"
6,16,Stan,"How much is this going to cost us?
"
6,16,Cartman,"Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?
"
6,16,Director,"So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding.
"
6,16,Randy,"I think he's pretty scared alright.
"
6,16,Sharon,"It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.
"
6,16,Director,"Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking.
"
6,16,Sharon,"Well that makes sense.
"
6,16,Director,"So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism.  Or that... one pill of Ecstasy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means.
"
6,16,Randy,"Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.
"
6,16,Butters,"Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. 
"
6,16,Butters,"Poop- poop swatches?
"
6,16,Cartman,"Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.
"
6,16,Butters,"Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?
"
6,16,Cartman,"Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.
"
6,16,Butters,"Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.
"
6,16,Butters,"Well that sounds good.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.
"
6,16,Butters,"Hooray!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.
"
6,16,Stan,"Yeah.
"
6,16,Cartman,"The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.
"
6,16,Stan,"Yeah.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.
"
6,16,Stan,"Yeah!
"
6,16,Cartman,"And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. 
"
6,16,Butters,"Wow! Neato!
"
6,16,Stan,"That's not neato, that sucks.
"
6,16,Cartman,"What?
"
6,16,Stan,"You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.
"
6,16,Stan,"Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog
"
6,16,Stan,"Dude!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?
"
6,16,Stan,"No, that's too extreme!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?
"
6,16,Stan,"Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! 
"
6,16,Cartman,"I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.
"
6,16,Stan,"Hey future self.
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Yes, former self?
"
6,16,Stan,"You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Oh, uh...
"
6,16,Stan,"You must know what I'm talking about.
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Sure uh, uh,  oh man, could you all excuse me for a second? I think I'm gonna crap my pants. 
"
6,16,Sharon,"Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?
"
6,16,Randy,"Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.
"
6,16,Stan,"Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 
"
6,16,Randy,"Oh. You. You don't?
"
6,16,Stan,"No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
"
6,16,Randy,"Well, you know what I think, Stan?
"
6,16,Stan,"What?
"
6,16,Randy,"I think he IS from the future.
"
6,16,Sharon,"Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?
"
6,16,Randy,"Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.
"
6,16,Sharon,"Right. 
"
6,16,Cartman,"Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!
"
6,16,Felipe,"¿Qué? ¿La caca no esta aquí? 
"
6,16,Cartman,"¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!
"
6,16,Felipe,"¡Sí, sí señor! 
"
6,16,Cartman,"Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.
"
6,16,Carlos,"Sí. Marrado. 
"
6,16,Cartman,"Marrado. Spectacularrr.
"
6,16,Carlos,"Sí. 
"
6,16,Cartman,"God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?
"
6,16,Butters,"Boy, it sure is stinky in here!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.
"
6,16,Butters,"Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
"
6,16,Cartman,"Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Yes, well, it's hard to find work in commercials, so I ended up- 
"
6,16,Randy,"Oh, Stan! 
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Oh, dude, how's it goin', man? Ey, you wanna go upstairs and play hide and go seek?
"
6,16,Stan,"Hide and go seek, huh?!
"
6,16,Randy,"Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?
"
6,16,Stan,"I don't believe that he's my future self!
"
6,16,Randy,"Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?
"
6,16,Stan,"No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
"
6,16,Sharon,"S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.
"
6,16,Stan,"But I have to know for sure. 
"
6,16,Randy,"Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. 
"
6,16,Stan,"Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
"
6,16,Randy,"Stan...
"
6,16,Stan,"Yes?
"
6,16,Randy,"Uh... nothing. Go ahead.
"
6,16,Sharon,"Randy!
"
6,16,Stan,"AAAH! 
"
6,16,Randy,"AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!
"
6,16,Future Stan,"Oh, Jesus Christ! Help me!
"
6,16,Stan,"That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
"
6,16,Randy,"Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too. 
"
6,16,Sharon,"Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?
"
6,16,Cartman,"Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.
"
6,16,Butters,"Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
"
6,16,Cartman,"Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!
"
6,16,Butters,"Uh but Cartman! Wait!  Oh Christmas! 
"
6,16,Stan,"Butters!
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh, Stan!
"
6,16,Stan,"Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
"
6,16,Butters,"Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.
"
6,16,Stan,"Butters, we're running away!
"
6,16,Butters,"We are?
"
6,16,Stan,"Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! 
"
6,16,Stephen,"What the hell is this?!
"
6,16,Linda,"Oh my God, our house!
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now
"
6,16,Stephen,"Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?!
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh, not really sir, I just uh...
"
6,16,Linda,"Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault.
"
6,16,Stephen,"What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son.
"
6,16,Stan,"Huh?
"
6,16,Stephen,"Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib.
"
6,16,Linda,"We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.
"
6,16,Stephen,"We thought the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son! 
"
6,16,Linda,"We're sorry, baby. 
"
6,16,Stan,"Get the fuck out of here. 
"
6,16,Randy,"Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.
"
6,16,Sharon,"Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future.
"
6,16,Stan,"Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
"
6,16,Randy,"Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.
"
6,16,Stan,"I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
"
6,16,Randy,"Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.
"
6,16,Stan,"I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
"
6,16,Sharon,"He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them
"
6,16,Randy,"Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!
"
6,16,Director,"Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!
"
6,16,Randy,"You really did a nice job, Eric. 
"
6,16,Stan,"Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
"
6,16,Sharon,"Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.
"
6,16,Future Cartman,"Atta boy, Eric. You've made the right choice.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Who the hell are you?
"
6,16,Future Cartman,"Haha, it's me, Cartman! You from the future.  I came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around. You stop eating junk food and you start studying harder, you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become CEO of your own time-travel company!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!
"
6,16,Future Cartman,"Right on!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!
"
6,16,Future Cartman,"No, wait!  Oh, God-damnit!
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Av-a-a-alright, I'm done.
"
6,17,Cartman,"You're done?
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Yeah, so how's it look?
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good.
"
6,17,Cartman,"But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents.
"
6,17,Cartman,"What?!
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? 
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Yes, wa-a-I didn't think ""hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot"" really counted as nice.
"
6,17,Cartman,"It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you.
"
6,17,Cartman,"God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Hey hey,  I'm just your naughty-and-nice accountant! Don't blame me for the numbers!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?
"
6,17,Cartman,"Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"If you cure cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Jesus Christ!
"
6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do... the nicest, greaatest thing anyone has ever done. Ever. 
"
6,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays!
"
6,17,Townsfolk,"Hooray!! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!  Christmas Tree!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! 
"
6,17,Kyle,"What are you doing, Cartman?
"
6,17,Cartman,"I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.
"
6,17,Mayor McDaniels,"But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us.  Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, there is no Christmas. They have nothing.
"
6,17,Jimbo,"Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda.  Light the damn tree!
"
6,17,Townsfolk,"YEAH! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!
"
6,17,Cartman,"You guys, that's it!

6,17,Cartman,"Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now! 
"
6,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Ahalright, here to light the Christmas Tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of Christmas. Jimmy. 
"
6,17,Jimmy,"Wow, what a terrific audience. Thank you for giving me this great honor, Mayor. B-before I l, l.. light the tree, I was wondering if I could sing... my favorite ...Christmas song, real quick.
"
6,17,Townsfolk,"Awww
"
6,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks?
"
6,17,Townsfolk,"Christmas songs! Christmas songs! Christmas songs!

6,17,Cartman,"...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore.  And here! Here's some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.
"
6,17,Stan,"Cartman, why are you doing this?
"
6,17,Cartman,"They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.
"
6,17,Kyle,"That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
"
6,17,A voice,"Hoooowwwwdy ho! 
"
6,17,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'?
"
6,17,Kyle,"Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
"
6,17,Cartman,"The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit!  I know someone who can help. Santa Claus!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Really?
"
6,17,"Stan, Kyle","Really?
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away!
"
6,17,Kyle,"But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Oh, that's no problem! We just need a little Christmas magic.  All aboard the Poo Choo Express!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Wow!
"
6,17,Stan,"Wuh, that smells. 
"
6,17,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Next stop, the North Pole!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
"
6,17,Stan,"Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. 
"
6,17,Kyle,"Me neither.
"
6,17,Cartman,"You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate!  Now come on!
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Let's go, Poo Choo Train! 
"
6,17,Whistle,"Poo Choo! 
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Poo Choo Train's layin' down its tracks with a
"
6,17,Whistle,"Poo Choo!
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"All the way and back!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
"
6,17,Stan,"I don't know.
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Christmastime wouldn't be the same without hugs and kisses and a Poo Choo Train.
"
6,17,Jimmy,"...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear t...t...tree. On the third day of C...Chrihhh...Chriiii...
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Here we are, kids. The North Pole. 
"
6,17,Stan,"Awww! 
"
6,17,Kyle,"Finally!
"
6,17,Stan,"God, it took forever!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Wow, is that where Santa lives?
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"That's it. Santa's Fortress of Solitude. 
"
6,17,Gnome 1,"Mr. Hankey!
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business.
"
6,17,Gnome 1,"Sure thing!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?
"
6,17,Gnome 1,"Ten months out of the year. But this time of year we help Santa!  Here he is! 
"
6,17,Santa,"Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas!
"
6,17,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","Wow!
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Howdy ho, Santa!
"
6,17,Santa,"Mr. Hankey, how are you?
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"All ready for Christmas?
"
6,17,Santa,"I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?
"
6,17,Santa,"Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Oh, that's so lame of them. 
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.
"
6,17,Santa,"You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.
"
6,17,Cartman,"That's what I thought.
"
6,17,Santa,"Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run!
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"All right!
"
6,17,Santa,"And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Hooray!
"
6,17,Jimmy,"...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear tree. On the ...fourth day of C...C...Ca...Chriiiistmas my t-true love g-ge-gave to me-mee.
"
6,17,Gnome 1,"This is Santa's flight control center. From here, we can monitor Santa from satellite as he travels the globe delivering presents.
"
6,17,Kyle,"Wow, cool!
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Hey, it looks like Santa has already made it to Baghdad. 
"
6,17,Santa,"Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone!  Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all!
"
6,17,Iraqi Man 1,"Paka klakalaka
"
6,17,Iraqi Man 2,"Anah kakadakadaka.
"
6,17,Santa,"Merry Christmas!  I'm hit! I'm hit! 
"
6,17,Gnome 1,"Sleigh is hit! I repeat! Sleigh is hit! 
"
6,17,Gnome 2,"Ultimate failure at o-sixhundred feet! 
"
6,17,Santa,"Hold on!  Sleigh is going down! 
"
6,17,Gnome 1,"Sleigh is going down! I repeat! Sleigh is going down!
"
6,17,Stan,"Hang on, Santa! 
"
6,17,Gnome 3,"Sleigh 1 is going down! We are going down! 
"
6,17,Gnome 4,"Don't look down! Don't look down! Repeat! Don't look down! 
"
6,17,Gnome 1,"We got a red sleigh down. We got a red sleigh down.  Red Sleigh 2, this is North Pole.  Red Sleigh 1, this is North Pole.  Mr. Kringle? 
"
6,17,Gnome 5,"Jesus Christ, they killed him!
"
6,17,Cartman,"No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
"
6,17,Stan,"Why would Iraqis do that? Why?
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them.
"
6,17,Santa,"North Pole. This is Santa.
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Santa! Are you alright?
"
6,17,Gnome 2,"What is your status?
"
6,17,Santa,"Sleigh is down. Reindeer... all dead. Both Santa's legs are broken. Santa's... very sad. Santa will have to... oh no. They're coming for me!  Stay back, you bastards! Stay back! 
"
6,17,Stan,"Oh no.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
"
6,17,Gnome 5,"What the hell are we supposed to do?! We're like nine inches tall!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.
"
6,17,Stan,"Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Oh, Christ.
"
6,17,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","Jesus!
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Hey, that's right. Jesus can save anybody.
"
6,17,Gnome 2,"Follow me. You can take Santa's backup sleigh. 
"
6,17,Jimmy,"On the fifth... day... day of... Christmas,  ...my t-true love gave to... uh... me. Five g-g-g... golden ruh-ring... rings.  Fuhgom... don... t-t... don... four cal...ling buh-irr
"
6,17,Gnome 2,"We fed Jesus Christ's data into the autopilot. This slide should be able to take you right to him.
"
6,17,Stan,"I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
"
6,17,Gnome 2,"Here it is. Red Sleigh 2. 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
"
6,17,Gnome 2,"You just have to call out the reindeer's names.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-
"
6,17,Gnome 2,"No, no, they're all dead. You have to call out the new ones.  On Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel.  Good luck finding Jesus! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"We should be able to find Jesus in no time!
"
6,17,Cartman,"I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
"
6,17,Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
6,17,Cartman,"I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.
"
6,17,Kyle,"Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!
"
6,17,Kyle,"All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
"
6,17,Cartman,"It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...
"
6,17,Jimmy,"Six geese are laying... fu...five go-oldenh ...uhrings. Fodom... dom... du...du...t...du... Four calling biiirds
"
6,17,Santa,"Where are you taking me??  You are all being very naughty. 
"
6,17,Iraqi General,"Why you come to Iraq, my main man?
"
6,17,Santa,"To bring happiness and joy to the children.
"
6,17,Iraqi General,"And this is...?  This is what you think brings happy?  This is material...  This is commercialism! My country is sick. Sick! 
"
6,17,Santa,"No, your country has just lost all its Christmas spirit.  What's going on here?!
"
6,17,Iraqi General,"America wants to bomb my house, my main man. They want to kill my wife and children. We need to know... what is their plan?
"
6,17,Santa,"I don't know, I live in the North Pole.  What are you doing??
"
6,17,Iraqi General,"They say that the Chinese were the first to experiment with a little shock to the testicles.
"
6,17,Santa,"Oh no. Not Santa's balls! 
"
6,17,Iraqi General,"What else is America planning?!
"
6,17,Santa,"I'm gonna fucking kill you!
"
6,17,Iraqi General,"You're not in a position to kill anyone, my main man! I just want you to tell me America's plan!
"
6,17,Santa,"Then we're in for a long night, 'cause I don't know shit! 
"
6,17,Jesus,"In nome del mio padre, siete guarito. 
"
6,17,Elderlay man,"Benedicali! Benedicali! 
"
6,17,Woman,"Jesus, mio bambino no puoi sentirsi. 
"
6,17,Jesus,"Il vostro bambino se arguisto. 
"
6,17,Woman,"Bene, Benedicali!  La morte rossa! 
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Hooowdy ho! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Jesus!
"
6,17,Jesus,"Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children?
"
6,17,Stan,"Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
"
6,17,Jesus,"Santa? Is he alright?
"
6,17,Kyle,"We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
"
6,17,Jesus,"We have to get him out of there.
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Do you know a way?
"
6,17,Jesus,"Yes. Yes, I think I do.  We need a little Christmas miracle.  Lock and load! We're goin' in!
"
6,17,Jimmy,"On the s...seventh day of Christmas my t...true love ...
"
6,17,Iraqi General,"You're a sick capitalist dog, my main man! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.
"
6,17,Gnome,"Red Sleiogh 2, come in.
"
6,17,Stan,"We're here.
"
6,17,Gnome,"You're coming up on the source of the signal. You're right on top of him!
"
6,17,Jesus,"He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey.
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Howdy ho, Jesus. 
"
6,17,Soldier 1,"Gankueda!
"
6,17,Jesus,"Wait here, I can handle this.
"
6,17,Soldier 2,"Kinkeda? Kinkakueda!
"
6,17,Jesus,"Yay, look upon me, and know me.
"
6,17,Soldier 1,"Halak balah!
"
6,17,Soldier 2,"Kli malah!
"
6,17,Jesus,"My children, you should know something.  I'm packing.  Let's go! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
"
6,17,Jimmy,"On the el- el- el- eleventh of C- Christmas my t...true love gave to me, e-eleven p-p-pipers p-pu-p-piping...
"
6,17,Iraqi General,"Drink it! Drink the oil! This is all you Western capitalists want! 
"
6,17,Santa,"Jesus Christ! 
"
6,17,Iraqi General,"Ach!
"
6,17,Santa,"Oh! Thank! Thank God for you, Jesus! 
"
6,17,Jesus,"Here.  Can you walk?
"
6,17,Santa,"Santa's legs are broken. 
"
6,17,Jesus,"There, they are healed.  Santa...
"
6,17,Santa,"I just couldn't do it.  I just couldn't let him live. He shocked Santa's balls! 
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"More soldiers are coming!
"
6,17,Jesus,"Let's move. Move!
"
6,17,Jimmy,"Eight... maids are... milking...
"
6,17,Jesus,"Get up the stairs! The sleigh is on the roof! 
"
6,17,Kyle,"Jesus, behind you! 
"
6,17,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","Jesus! 
"
6,17,Santa,"No!  Jesus. Jesus!  No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch.
"
6,17,Jesus,"You're a... bad liar.  Yay. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh?
"
6,17,Santa,"We sure did, Jesus.
"
6,17,Stan,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
6,17,Jesus,"Uh Santa?
"
6,17,Santa,"I'm here, Jesus.
"
6,17,Jesus,"Don't... don't ever... let them take away... our... Christmas spirit. 
"
6,17,Stan,"Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus.
"
6,17,Kyle,"You bastards. 
"
6,17,Santa,"Come on, kids! 
"
6,17,Santa,"Get to the sleigh! Get to the sleigh! 
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Start the sleigh!
"
6,17,Stan,"Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
"
6,17,Kyle,"On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
"
6,17,Kyle,"Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
"
6,17,Santa,"You're right, kid. 
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"What are you doin', Santa?
"
6,17,Santa,"I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and by God I'm gonna do it! 
"
6,17,Santa,"Hohoho! Merry Christmas! 
"
6,17,Soldier,"Dakadaka!
"
6,17,Stan,"RPG, four o'clock!
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy now!
"
6,17,Santa,"Merry Christmas! Hohoho!
"
6,17,Santa,"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!
"
6,17,Jimmy,"And a p-p-par-tridge in a p-peeeaaar treeee. 
"
6,17,Mayor McDaniels,"That's it? That's it! The song's over! We can light the tree! 
"
6,17,Townsfolk,"Hurrah! Woohoo! Yay!
"
6,17,Jimbo,"Oh, finally!
"
6,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more seconds until Christmas! 
"
6,17,Townsfolk,"Awwww!
"
6,17,Randy,"Christmas is ruined again! 
"
6,17,Santa,"Ho ho ho! 
"
6,17,Townsfolk,"WOW!!! 
"
6,17,Randy,"Stan!
"
6,17,Gerald,"Kyle!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!
"
6,17,Stan,"We brought Christmas to Iraq!
"
6,17,Santa,"Everyone! Everyone, can I please have your attention?  Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day. we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus.
"
6,17,Townsfolk,"Hooray!
"
6,17,Santa,"Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do. 
"
6,17,Mr. Hankey,"I'll help you, Santa!
"
6,17,Santa,"Oh, and boys, you might want to check under the Christmas tree.  Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! 
"
6,17,Stan,"Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! 
"
6,17,Stan,"Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. 
"
6,17,Kenny,"(Hey guys. What's goin' on?)
"
6,17,Stan,"Oh, hey Kenny.
"
6,17,Kyle,"Dude, where have you been?
"
6,17,Kenny,"(Oh, I've just been hanging out.)
"
6,17,Kyle,"Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. 
"
6,17,Stan,"Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
"
6,17,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
