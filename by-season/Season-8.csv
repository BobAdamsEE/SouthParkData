8,1,Kyle,"Stop it, Cartman!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Pfaha, so funny. 
"
8,1,Kyle,"Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! 
"
8,1,Roger,"Come on and take a look, folks. We've got a lot of knives for sale here. 
"
8,1,Stan,"Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. 
"
8,1,Kyle,"Wow, cool.
"
8,1,Stan,"Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.
"
8,1,Cartman,"I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.
"
8,1,Kenny,"(Shuriken. Awesome!)
"
8,1,Roger,"Can I help you boys? 
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
"
8,1,Roger,"Okay, uh, you need to have your parents here when you buy them, though. I, I can't sell to anyone under eighteen without parents' permission. 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Parents? Parents?!  Oh God! 
"
8,1,Roger,"Wha- wha- what's the matter? 
"
8,1,Stan,"We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?!  Why?! 
"
8,1,Kyle,"Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
"
8,1,Roger,"It's all right, it's all right boys. Don't cry, I'll... I'll just... go pack these up for you, okay? 
"
8,1,Stan,"Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
"
8,1,Stan,"Kiya! Kiya!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Kaii yo! 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!
"
8,1,Stan,"With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.
"
8,1,Stan,"What's your ninja name, Kenny?
"
8,1,Kenny,"(unintelligible)
"
8,1,Cartman,"Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies
"
8,1,Stan,"All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Kick ass! 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.
"
8,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, that'd be awesome!)
"
8,1,Kyle,"No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
"
8,1,Kyle,"You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.
"
8,1,Stan,"Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. 
"
8,1,Kyle,"I still say this is a bad idea.
"
8,1,Stan,"Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Look what we got.
"
8,1,Craig,"Where'd you get those?
"
8,1,Stan,"We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
"
8,1,Craig,"Uh-uh, they're not that cool.
"
8,1,Stan,"Hyeah, ""they're not that cool."" These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
"
8,1,Kyle,"But don't tell anybody we have them.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Ugh.
"
8,1,Token,"Whoa! Where'd you get those?!
"
8,1,Clyde,"Let me see.
"
8,1,Stan,"Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!
"
8,1,All,"Ho! 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
"
8,1,Stan,"Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! 
"
8,1,Butters,"Hey fellas. What's happenin'?
"
8,1,Cartman,"We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
"
8,1,Butters,"Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
"
8,1,Cartman,"No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Yes, and no time to do it. No time... 
"
8,1,Butters,"I think I'd make a really good ninja.  Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. 
"
8,1,Butters,"I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
"
8,1,Linda,"Hi Butters.
"
8,1,Butters,"Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! 
"
8,1,Linda,"Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?
"
8,1,Butters,"Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.
"
8,1,Linda,"Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.
"
8,1,Butters,"Well, o- okay Mom.  Bah! Gah! 
"
8,1,Stan,"Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
"
8,1,Kyle,"God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
"
8,1,Cartman,"I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
"
8,1,Kyle,"No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
"
8,1,Cartman,"I have the power to have all the powers I want.
"
8,1,Kyle,"That doesn't count, fatass!
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!
"
8,1,Cartman,"C'mon!
"
8,1,Butters,"Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Who the hell is that?
"
8,1,Stan,"I dunno. Craig, is that you?
"
8,1,Butters,"Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Whoa.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
"
8,1,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
8,1,Stan,"Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.
"
8,1,Butters,"Nuh uh!
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah, huh, I got you!
"
8,1,Butters,"Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
"
8,1,Cartman,"That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! 
"
8,1,Butters,"Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! 
"
8,1,Cartman,"All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
"
8,1,Cartman,"All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! 
"
8,1,Kyle,"God dammit Cartman!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
"
8,1,Butters,"Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
"
8,1,Stan,"Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!
"
8,1,Kenny,"(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)  (Feel my wrath!) 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Oh, shit, dude!
"
8,1,Stan,"Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
"
8,1,Kyle,"What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!
"
8,1,Kenny,"(I just threw my ninja star at him.)
"
8,1,Butters,"It hurts! It hurts! 
"
8,1,Kyle,"Oh man! We are in serious trouble!
"
8,1,Stan,"Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.
"
8,1,Butters,"But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! 
"
8,1,Stan,"Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.
"
8,1,Stan,"Dude, shut up!
"
8,1,Kyle,"I agree with Cartman!
"
8,1,Stan,"What?!
"
8,1,Kyle,"You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
"
8,1,Stan,"Just stay still, Butters.
"
8,1,Butters,"Ah.  Hwa!  Hwaaaaa!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
"
8,1,Butters,"You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! 
"
8,1,Kyle,"If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.
"
8,1,Stan,"God dammit!
"
8,1,Kyle,"God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.
"
8,1,Butters,"Whoa, I'm getting woozy.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. 
"
8,1,Stan,"We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
"
8,1,Cartman,"Dr. Shafley?
"
8,1,Stan,"He's really old and going blind.
"
8,1,Cartman,"So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
"
8,1,Kyle,"Oh no.
"
8,1,Stan,"We might pass him off as our pet.
"
8,1,Butters,"But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.
"
8,1,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","Shut up, Butters!
"
8,1,Kyle,"That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!
"
8,1,Stan,"All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. 
"
8,1,Butters,"Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
"
8,1,Kyle,"We need some more fur.  I think that's good.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
"
8,1,Butters,"Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff.
"
8,1,Stan,"All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
"
8,1,Stan,"Okay, it's clear. 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
"
8,1,Butters,"Wuhuff, woof, woof.
"
8,1,Kyle,"We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! 
"
8,1,Stan,"Oh shit, somebody's coming!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Quick, hide Butters! 
"
8,1,Cartman,"In here! 
"
8,1,Butters,"bu- but fellas, I gotta- 
"
8,1,Craig,"Aha!  There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got! 
"
8,1,Cartman,"No way, you got weapons too?!
"
8,1,Stan,"Where'd you get those?
"
8,1,Jimmy,"From the n-n- from the nn-, from the nn-
"
8,1,Clyde,"From the nice guy at the county fair.
"
8,1,Craig,"At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
"
8,1,Craig,"So,  how would you ninjas like to do battle?
"
8,1,Stan,"Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.
"
8,1,Craig,"You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! 
"
8,1,Kyle,"He said, not now, Craig!
"
8,1,Craig,"I am not Craig,  I am Ginza,  with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!
"
8,1,Token,"And I am Black Chaku,  with the power of perfect spelling!
"
8,1,Stan,"Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay? 
"
8,1,Jimmy,"Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?
"
8,1,Cartman,"We're twice the ninjas you fags are!
"
8,1,Clyde,"Then fight us!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
"
8,1,Kyle,"I swore to never fight again.
"
8,1,Stan,"We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah!

"
8,1,Stan,"Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!
"
8,1,Craig,"Lose who?
"
8,1,Kyle,"Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!
"
8,1,Craig,"Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding?
"
8,1,Cartman,"Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!
"
8,1,Craig,"Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!
"
8,1,Stan,"No dude, you gotta help us find him!
"
8,1,Craig,"To hell with that!
"
8,1,Cartman,"We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!

Kyle:
Hey Butters!
"
8,1,Stan,"Butters!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Dude, look! 
"
8,1,Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
8,1,The Boys,"Hey, Chef.
"
8,1,Chef,"How's it goin'?
"
8,1,Stan,"Bad.
"
8,1,Chef,"Why bad?
"
8,1,Kyle,"Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?
"
8,1,Chef,"No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?
"
8,1,Stan,"Nothing, just... playing.
"
8,1,Chef,"Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Yeah, we know.
"
8,1,Chef,"Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children! 
"
8,1,Nurse,"Oh my God!  What the-?! Doctor? Doctor?!
"
8,1,Dr. Doctor,"Jesus Christ.  What kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog?! Poor little pup.
"
8,1,Butters,"Woof woof.
"
8,1,Nurse,"Can you help him, Doctor?
"
8,1,Dr. Doctor,"I'm afraid I wouldn't know how. Unfortunately for this little fella, I'm a people doctor. Best we call the animal shelter.
"
8,1,Nurse,"Right away.
"
8,1,Announcer,"In our last episode the four ninjas did battle with Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and doom. It was during that great battle that ninja master Kenny threw his star into Professor Chaos' eye. Now the ninjas were in serious trouble, because their parents might find out they had weapons, if Professor Chaos told on them. While trying to get Professor Chaos some aid at the veterinarian's office, the four ninjas ran into Craig and his three friends. They challenged the four ninjas to fight, and the legendary battle of Tokutawa began. It was during this battle that Professor Chaos escaped, and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with Craig and his friends to find Professor Chaos, or else they would all be grounded.
"
8,1,Stan,"Butters!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Butters!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Here, Butters!
"
8,1,Kenny,"(Butters!)
"
8,1,Craig,"Butters!
"
8,1,Clyde,"Butters!
"
8,1,Token,"Butters!
"
8,1,Craig,"Butters! Where the hell are you?!
"
8,1,Kyle,"It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! 
"
8,1,Stan,"What?
"
8,1,Kyle,"Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
"
8,1,Kyle,"We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Screw you, fatass! 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming ""NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it. 
"
8,1,Kyle,"I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
"
8,1,Stan,"It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.
"
8,1,Vet,"Come on. Come on, little fella. 'Atta boy. 
"
8,1,Butters,"Woof woof. 
"
8,1,Vet,"Right over here.  Good dog. Come on.  There you go, right in there.  Goooood dog. 
"
8,1,Butters,"Gaaaah!
"
8,1,Assistant,"Somebody threw a ninja star in that poor puppy's eye?
"
8,1,Vet,"It just makes me sick how some people can treat animals.  Well, nothing we can do for it; let's put it to sleep, shall we?  Here you go, pup. I've got a sweet dose of murder for you.  What the? Blasted! He's escaped! ...Oh well, let's murder one of these other dogs.
"
8,1,Stan,"All right, the county fair's still open! 
"
8,1,Roger,"Can I help you boys?
"
8,1,Stan,"We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
"
8,1,Roger,"Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!
"
8,1,Roger,"I thought you told me your parents were dead.
"
8,1,Craig,"You guys!  You guys!
"
8,1,Stan,"What is it, Craig?
"
8,1,Craig,"It's Butters! We saw 'im!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Where?!
"
8,1,Craig,"Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Then it's not too late!
"
8,1,Stan,"Come on, Ninjas! 
"
8,1,Barker,"All right, folks, our next item up for bids is this lovely 19th Century lamp.
"
8,1,Stan,"Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.
"
8,1,Craig,"Butters is right on the other side.
"
8,1,Kyle,"We have to get past them!
"
8,1,Cartman,"All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
"
8,1,Kyle,"You have that power too?
"
8,1,Cartman,"I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected.  Here, hold this stuff for me.
"
8,1,Stan,"Good luck, Bulrog. 
"
8,1,Barker,"Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming.  It has a bronze finish and actual gold leaf along the base. This is a rare opportunity to own a classic antique.  The lamp has been appraised by our auction staff at well over two thousand dollars.  So we're gonna start the bidding at three hundred and seventy five. Do I, do I hear three hundred and seventy five?  Kid, what the hell do you think you're doin'? 
"
8,1,Butters,"Haba, haba! Habahoaha! 
"
8,1,Linda,"Butters! 
"
8,1,Randy,"What happened to him?
"
8,1,Sheila,"Oh my God!
"
8,1,Stan,"Oh, Jesus.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.
"
8,1,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people, we are all extremely upset over what's happened.  But let's try to speak one at a time.
"
8,1,Man 1,"Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!
"
8,1,Townsfolk,"Yeah! I agree!
"
8,1,Gerald,"This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!  The worst thing!
"
8,1,Man 2,"Yeah! I mean, there were children watching that auction! And when that little eight-year-old boy walked up and flashed his... penis! It was an outrage! 
"
8,1,Stan,"What?
"
8,1,Cartman,"What?
"
8,1,Skeeter,"Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the... penis! How am I supposed to explain that to her?!
"
8,1,Sheila,"This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down! 
"
8,1,Mr. Garrison,"You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!
"
8,1,Cartman,"I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. 
"
8,1,Kyle,"Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?
"
8,1,Stan,"Just run with it, dude.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!
"
8,1,Man,"Yeah! 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Yeah, I c- I can't believe it.
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
"
8,1,Kyle,"So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do.
"
8,1,The Boys,"Hya!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Hey fellas.
"
8,2,Stan,"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmy!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver.
"
8,2,Cartman,"The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
"
8,2,Kyle,"They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
"
8,2,Cartman,"What?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.
"
8,2,Stan,"Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
"
8,2,Kyle,"Yeah, that'd be cool.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year.
"
8,2,Kyle,"Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
8,2,Cartman,"Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
"
8,2,Kyle,"...You're an asshole, Cartman.
"
8,2,Cartman,"What? What'd I do?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"S-s-six!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"S-s-s-ssseven!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih. Timmih!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"S-s-seven!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih! Timmih!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Ni- I can- I can't!  Huff. Oh man.  Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year.  All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven ru-reps. Hoh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Otimmih. 
"
8,2,Francis,"Hey Jimmy, g-good luck on Saturday.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"You too, Francis. 
"
8,2,Nathan,"Hey Jimmy.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh he-hey, N-Nathan.
"
8,2,Nathan,"So uh, I see you train pretty hard.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training really hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away.
"
8,2,Nathan,"Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"What kind of shortcuts?
"
8,2,Nathan,"You know. Steroids.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"S-s-ss-s-s-steroids?  ...But aren't those illegal?
"
8,2,Nathan,"Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"So uh, ha-how do they... w-w-work?
"
8,2,Nathan,"You just take one of these little blue babies  three times a day  and inject this directly into your bloodstream  twice a day before meals.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"How much would this cost me?
"
8,2,Nathan,"Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a per-formance en... hancer.
"
8,2,Nathan,"Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend.  Whatever you say. 
"
8,2,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
"
8,2,Kyle,"What?
"
8,2,Cartman,"Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"" 
"
8,2,Stan,"So?
"
8,2,Cartman,"So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
"
8,2,Kyle,"Oh no. Cartman, no!
"
8,2,Cartman,"It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
"
8,2,Stan,"That's really, really terrible, dude.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. 
"
8,2,Kyle,"Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
"
8,2,Cartman,"Why?
"
8,2,Kyle,"Because! 
"
8,2,Cartman,"What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?!  Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh! Agh! Ju-just a second! 
"
8,2,Dad,"Jimmy?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Hang on, I'm-I'm, coming. 
"
8,2,Dad,"Jim, it's your father!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"I said I'm coming! Give me a Goddamned s-second!  Hold it. 
"
8,2,Dad,"Jimmy, were you masturbating?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"N-no, Dad.
"
8,2,Dad,"Okay. Well, you have a visitor. 
"
8,2,Girl,"Hi Jimmy.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy.
"
8,2,Nancy,"I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.
"
8,2,Dad,"I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week.
"
8,2,Dad,"I'll leave you two alone.  Y-You sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Dad, Jesus C-Christ!
"
8,2,Dad,"Okay, then. 
"
8,2,Cartman,"Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.
"
8,2,Kyle,"God damn you!
"
8,2,Cartman,"You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.
"
8,2,Kyle,"No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.
"
8,2,Cartman,"What?! 
"
8,2,Kyle,"It says right there ""a parent has to be with you to sign up,"" and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 
"
8,2,Cartman,"Moooommmm?
"
8,2,Liane,"Yes, hon? 
"
8,2,Cartman,"Um, could I get you to do something for me?
"
8,2,Liane,"What's that, hon?
"
8,2,Cartman,"Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? 
"
8,2,Liane,"Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... ""special"" children.
"
8,2,Cartman,"I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
"
8,2,Liane,"You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. 
"
8,2,Cartman,"...I'll split the money with you. 
"
8,2,Liane,"...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No. 
"
8,2,Cartman,"All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?
"
8,2,Liane,"Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Awesome.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih!  Tim- Timmy?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later?  I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih... 
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Look it's really none of your b-b-b-beeswax, Timmy!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih. Timmih!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih.  T-T-Timmih.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you?
"
8,2,Timmy,"Huh! Timmih! T-Timmih!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih! Timmih, Jimmih!  Arrrh Timmih!  Jimmih!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Huh... Timmih...  Timmih.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"S-s-s-so what are you gonna do now, huh?! You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show that b-bottle to the... coaches?!  Don't think you're any better than me, Timmy! I'm just living in the real world!  Fuck!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih!  Aaar-yaaaaah Timmih! 
"
8,2,Coach,"All right, thirty yards, Timmy! Keep it up!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Oowrrr! Timmih! Livilaye!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Y-yeess! Grrrr!
"
8,2,Coach 2,"Wuh-wow, Jimmy, I can't believe how much you've improved! You're bigger and stronger than I've ever seen you!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard.
"
8,2,Coach 2,"You keep going like this and you'll break Special Olympics records on Saturday!
"
8,2,Man,"Okay, so this is all the stuff we need to sign Michael in?
"
8,2,Volunteer,"Yup. Just take the sign-up sheet down to the next table and we'll get it all finalized.
"
8,2,Woman,"Thank you very much.
"
8,2,Volunteer,"Thank you! Good luck, Michael.
"
8,2,Michael,"Thanks.
"
8,2,Volunteer,"Okay, next in line please?
"
8,2,Cartman,"Naaaa! Daaaaa!
"
8,2,Volunteer,"Hello there.
"
8,2,Liane,"Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Naaaa!
"
8,2,Volunteer,"Oh, great! What's his name?
"
8,2,Liane,"Eric Cartman...
"
8,2,Cartman,"Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
"
8,2,Volunteer,"Okay. Age?
"
8,2,Liane,"He's nine.
"
8,2,Volunteer,"O-kay, and what's his disability?
"
8,2,Liane,"...Um, he's retarded. 
"
8,2,Volunteer,"...N-no, I'm asking what his specific condition is. Down's Syndrome? Cerebral palsy?
"
8,2,Liane,"Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition?
"
8,2,Cartman,"...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
"
8,2,Volunteer,"I'll just leave that blank for now.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Yeah, b-bigger, stronger! 
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, hi Timmy. Come on in.  I understand you have somethin' important you wanna talk to me about, m'kay?
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmy.
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well, Timmy, as your counselor, I want you to know that you can tell me anything, m'kay? And whatever's troublin' you, I wanna try and, and help you with it.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmy.
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Mmm'kay, right, you're Timmy. ...Yo-you have a problem?
"
8,2,Timmy,"No Timmy, Jimmy.
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Ji-Jimmy?
"
8,2,Timmy,"Haaa!  Oh, oh!  Jimmy.
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih! Timmih, uh, Jimmih.  Hey Timmy, Timmih Tim-oh! Tim-Timmih!  Timmmih? Jimmih! Jimmih.  Jimmih Timmih Timmih? Timmih, Timmih! Jimmih... Jimmih! Jimmih! Timmih!  Timmih!
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Mmmmm'kaaay. I don't quite follow, Timmy.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Argh. Jimmy...
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Right, Jimmy Valmer.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Uh. , Timmih Jimmih Jimmih Jim-  Jimmh Timmih Timmih Jimmih!
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Right. He's Jimmy, yeah.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Haaaaaaaaaah!
"
8,2,Cartman,"Enter. 
"
8,2,Kyle,"Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. 
"
8,2,Cartman,"Go on, Kyle.
"
8,2,Kyle,"I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
"
8,2,Cartman,"Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-
"
8,2,Kyle,"I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
"
8,2,Cartman,"Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
"
8,2,Kyle,"I came here to talk about you!
"
8,2,Cartman,"Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck. 
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Come on, push it! Push it!  Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps. 
"
8,2,Nancy,"Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time.
"
8,2,Nancy,"I guess I didn't realize I was a waste of time.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh Jesus!  You gonna start running your mouth off again?  P-push it! Push it!
"
8,2,Nancy,"Jimmy, everyone's worried about you. You seem... different.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Theh-they're all just... jealous.
"
8,2,Nancy,"You're not the boy I fell in love with last week during Free Period. I'm leaving you.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!
"
8,2,Nancy,"You can't treat people like this!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why did you make me do it, huh?!  You're not leavin' anybody! You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told!  '
"
8,2,Sarah Valmer,"What the?  Jimmy, oh my God!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Stay away from me, you stupid b-b-b-bitches!  No! God!  '
"
8,2,Host,"Welcome, everyone, to the 2004 Special Olympics!  We will be holding various throughout the day, and at the end of it all we will have some very special celebrity athletes here to present the trophy for top athlete, along with the cash prize of one thousand dollars.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Top athlete, yeah! '
"
8,2,Cartman,"One thousand dollars, yeah!
"
8,2,Host,"So let's have all our athletes report to their first assigned events and... Let the Games begin! 
"
8,2,Announcer,"Will those athletes in heat 1 of the hundred-meter dash please report to Track Area B.
"
8,2,Volunteer 2,"Okay, racers, are we ready?  Take your marks.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Daaaa! Daaaa! '
"
8,2,Volunteer 2,"On your marks! Get set! Go! 
"
8,2,Cartman,"Whoa. What the hell?? 
"
8,2,Volunteer 2,"Great job, everyone.  You three advance to the next heat. 
"
8,2,Winner,"All right!
"
8,2,Blond Boy,"Good Job.
"
8,2,Blonde Girl,"We did it!
"
8,2,Cartman,"Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Yeeessss!  Yes! Yes!
"
8,2,Announcer,"He's got it! That's a new Special Olympics record, folks! 
"
8,2,Cartman,"God-damnit!
"
8,2,Announcer,"Winner, Jimmy Valmer! 
"
8,2,Cartman,"All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards! 
"
8,2,Cartman,"God-damnit!
"
8,2,Announcer,"That's another Special Olympics record!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Yeah! Yeah!  Yeah, I did it!  Yeah! Yeah! '
"
8,2,Host,"Ladies and Gentlemen, our day of competition has come to an end, and we have an ultimate grand special champion for 2004! Here to present the award are baseball legends Mark McGuire, Jason Giambi, and Barry Bonds. 
"
8,2,Bonds,"The 2004 special athlete is... Jimmy Valmer.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Yeah! Fuck yeah!  Yeah, I did it! I'm the b-bub-best!  '
"
8,2,Host,"Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know that the Special Olympics isn't just about winning. And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!
"
8,2,Cartman,"Ah, screw you hippies!
"
8,2,Host,"For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will receive this gift certificate to Shakey's for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric!
"
8,2,Cartman,"...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?! '
"
8,2,Cartman,"Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. '
"
8,2,Jimmy,"You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?!  I should k- ick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih! '
"
8,2,Jimmy,"What?
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih! '
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh my God. You-you're right, Timmy. You're totally right.  Everyone, can I have your attention, please?  I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting.  A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him.  Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics.  Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a  big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say,  ""Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy- ""  ""-steroid-taking jackass.""  That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year. To compete with honor.  '
"
8,2,McGuire,"Hey kid. Good for you for being honest.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes!  Grow up! 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
"
8,3,Stan,"Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.
"
8,3,Cartman,"What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
"
8,3,Kyle,"I'm a Vulcan!
"
8,3,Cartman,"All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
"
8,3,Kyle,"The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
"
8,3,Cartman,"All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
"
8,3,Kyle,"No! I'm on the away team too! 
"
8,3,Cartman,"It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
"
8,3,Kyle,"I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Set phasers on stun.
"
8,3,Stan,"Things seem pretty quiet.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Yes. A little too quiet.
"
8,3,Kyle,"I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!
"
8,3,Kyle,"No it doesn't. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!
"
8,3,Kyle,"No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!
"
8,3,Stan,"Oh God, here we go again.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
"
8,3,Kyle,"He does not!
"
8,3,Cartman,"How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
"
8,3,Kyle,"Naw uh!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Go see the movie, Kyle!
"
8,3,Stan,"That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Me too!) 
"
8,3,Kyle,"I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
"
8,3,Cartman,"You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
"
8,3,Kyle,"People don't hate the Jews!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
"
8,3,Kyle,"...You're a stupid asshole! 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! 
"
8,3,Kyle,"One please.
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"This is an R-rated movie.
"
8,3,Kyle,"Yeah, I know, but I have to-
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in to see it.
"
8,3,Kyle,"...Thanks. 
"
8,3,Soldier 1,"Hac bashtud Christo.
"
8,3,Soldier 2,"Et lac Hesus. Belaca veshtad.
"
8,3,Jesus,"Wa! 
"
8,3,Kyle,"Haaaah! 
"
8,3,Jesus,"Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!! 
"
8,3,Kyle,"How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Pretty brutal, isn't it? Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?
"
8,3,Announcer,"And now, back to Terrance and Phillip. 
"
8,3,Phillip,"Hey Terrance, I think I have a-
"
8,3,Cartman,"Mom! Doorbell!
"
8,3,Terrance,"Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Mom! Answer the door!
"
8,3,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, guess what?
"
8,3,Cartman,"God damn it, lazy-ass whore. 
"
8,3,Phillip,"What?
"
8,3,Terrance,"Faaart.
"
8,3,Kyle,"You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
"
8,3,Cartman,"It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
"
8,3,Kyle,"You were, you were right?
"
8,3,Cartman,"Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
"
8,3,Kyle,"You were right. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.
"
8,3,Stan,"Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Goddamn.)
"
8,3,Stan,"Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
"
8,3,Stan,"Dude. That movie sucked.
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Yeah, it totally sucked!)
"
8,3,Stan,"How can they even call that a movie?
"
8,3,Kenny,"(I don't know!)
"
8,3,Stan,"That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Yeah!) 
"
8,3,Jack,"Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was.
"
8,3,Elise,"Me neither. Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on! 
"
8,3,Man 1,"I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus.
"
8,3,Woman 1,"Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into believing. 
"
8,3,Stan,"Hey, we want our money back.
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Huh?
"
8,3,Stan,"That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"I can't refund your money. You sat through the whole movie.
"
8,3,Stan,"That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
8,3,Stan,"You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for your sins!
"
8,3,Stan,"We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"I'm not allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie! You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.
"
8,3,Stan,"W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Yeah. I'd like to see you try.
"
8,3,Stan,"Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! 
"
8,3,Priests,"Kill him! Guilty! Kill him!  Kill him! Kill him! Die!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh! 
"
8,3,Stan,"Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! ""For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.."" Okay, okay, wait, here we go. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
"
8,3,Stan,"Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
"
8,3,Stan,"No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
"
8,3,Cartman,"What?
"
8,3,Stan,"We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
"
8,3,Cartman,"You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
"
8,3,Stan,"Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
"
8,3,Cartman,"If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
"
8,3,Stan,"Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
"
8,3,Stan,"I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
"
8,3,Stan,"Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
"
8,3,Cartman,"I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
"
8,3,Stan,"Wait a minute. Cartman?! 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Eup. 
"
8,3,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Malibu? But how?)
"
8,3,Stan,"We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
"
8,3,Liane,"Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
"
8,3,Cartman,"Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
"
8,3,Liane,"Oh, that's great, sweetie.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Tell them I'll be down shortly
"
8,3,Liane,"Okay, hon.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. 
"
8,3,Man 1,"Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?
"
8,3,Jack,"No. Actually, we're guests as well. I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise.
"
8,3,Elise,"Hello.
"
8,3,Man 2,"I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.
"
8,3,Elise,"Oh I agree. There are so many of us who are moved by The Passion. It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community.
"
8,3,Man 2,"And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.
"
8,3,Jack,"Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!
"
8,3,Woman 2,"It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Ah, hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
"
8,3,Woman 3,"We sure do. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. 
"
8,3,Elise,"Wha- what does that mean, sweetie?
"
8,3,Jack,"I'm not sure, but- uh.  Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together. The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
"
8,3,Man 3,"Oh, what a great idea! We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!
"
8,3,Guests,"Heheh, great! Yeah! Great idea.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"We sure do!
"
8,3,Guests,"Yeah. All right. Woohoo!
"
8,3,Stan,"Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. 
"
8,3,Mel,"Yes?
"
8,3,Stan,"Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Hello.)
"
8,3,Stan,"Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
"
8,3,Mel,"You can't not like The Passion! I just followed the Bible! Christ died for you. Go home. 
"
8,3,Stan,"Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
"
8,3,Mel,"Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first.  But I won't tell you where I keep my money.  You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!
"
8,3,Stan,"Tor- torture you?
"
8,3,Mel,"Ha! So you do intend to torture me, huh?!  Well go ahead! Do your worst!  You still won't get your ticket money back! I can take whatever you can dish out!
"
8,3,Stan,"We don't want to torture you.
"
8,3,Mel,"I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!
"
8,3,Stan,"Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
"
8,3,Mel,"I have to use that money to build my church! I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church! And do you know why?! So I can play banjo!  Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus!
"
8,3,Stan,"Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!
"
8,3,Mel,"How dare you call me crazy! This means war! 
"
8,3,Father Maxi,"And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins.
"
8,3,Kyle,"Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
"
8,3,Father Maxi,"...What is troubling you, my child?
"
8,3,Kyle,"Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
"
8,3,Father Maxi,"Ah! You mean he's a Jew!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
"
8,3,Father Maxi,"Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.
"
8,3,Kyle,"But how can the Jews make it better??
"
8,3,Father Maxi,"Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about atonement.
"
8,3,Kyle,"Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. 
"
8,3,Stan and Kenny,"Aaaah!
"
8,3,Mel,"Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker. You wanna get outta here? Talk to me. 
"
8,3,Stan,"Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! 
"
8,3,Mel,"Freedom! 
"
8,3,Stan,"Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? 
"
8,3,Mel,"Jesus is Lord! &gt; /&gt;
"
8,3,Stan,"All right, let's get the hell out of here! 
"
8,3,Mel,"When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!
"
8,3,Stan,"Aah! Run, dude, run!
"
8,3,Mel,"K'plagh! K'plagh! And good evening, frieeeeeeends!
"
8,3,Cartman,"One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Woah! Great idea!
"
8,3,Man 3,"It'll be like a parade!
"
8,3,Man 4,"Good idea!
"
8,3,Cartman,"And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"" you all chant back ""Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.""
"
8,3,Elise,"Well, what does that mean, dear?
"
8,3,Jack,"Oh, I think it's Aramaic. You know, like in the movie.
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Ooo, Aramaic. Cool.
"
8,3,Townsfolk,"Neato! That'll be awesome. Great!
"
8,3,Jack,"What was our Aramaic line again?
"
8,3,Cartman,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 
"
8,3,Townsfolk,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Es ist Zeit fër Rache!
"
8,3,Townsfolk,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
"
8,3,Elise,"Oh, this is fun! 
"
8,3,Cartman,"All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8,3,Townsfolk,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8,3,Townsfolk,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Nice.
"
8,3,Rabbi,"Shalom hak nak shalom. And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congregation. 
"
8,3,Kyle,"Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
"
8,3,Man 4,"What? 
"
8,3,Sheila,"Whatwhatwhaaat?!
"
8,3,Kyle,"If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
"
8,3,Man 5,"Oh my God! 
"
8,3,Gerald,"Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!
"
8,3,Kyle,"I saw The Passion!
"
8,3,Man 6,"Oh no! The Passion?! 
"
8,3,Man 7,"This proves the anti-Semitic effect that movie is having!
"
8,3,Man 8,"Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes.
"
8,3,Man 9,"Stereotyping Jews is terrible.
"
8,3,Woman 4,"Something must be done to stop that movie!
"
8,3,Rabbi,"Now, now, everyone calm down. We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie. There's no cause for alarm.
"
8,3,Mob,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Es ist Zeit für Rache! 
"
8,3,Mob,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8,3,Mob,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten! 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
8,3,Stan,"Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Yeah. I agree.) 
"
8,3,Stan,"Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. 
"
8,3,Mel,"Give me back my money! 
"
8,3,Stan,"Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
"
8,3,Driver,"Huh?
"
8,3,Stan,"Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
"
8,3,Driver,"Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games.
"
8,3,Stan,"I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- 
"
8,3,Driver,"What the hell?
"
8,3,Mel,"Haaaa! K'Plaaaa!
"
8,3,Driver,"Hey! That's Mel Gibson!
"
8,3,Stan,"Yeah. I told you that!
"
8,3,Driver,"Well, what the hell does he want?!
"
8,3,Stan,"He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
"
8,3,Driver,"You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. 
"
8,3,Kyle,"Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Can I help you?
"
8,3,Rabbi,"This movie is causing anti-Semitism! You must remove it from your theater!
"
8,3,Congregants,"That's right! Yeah! Remove your movie!
"
8,3,Shlomo,"Remove it from the theater? Fat chance!
"
8,3,Man 10,"We demand you stop showing it!
"
8,3,Congregants,"Yeah! Yeah!
"
8,3,Kyle,"No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Juden!
"
8,3,Jack,"What's going on here?
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.
"
8,3,Rabbi,"This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!
"
8,3,Man 11,"Nonsense! Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man! There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!
"
8,3,Elise,"It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.
"
8,3,Rabbi,"It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!
"
8,3,Jack,"Well, maybe you should apologize.
"
8,3,Mob,"That's right! What he said.
"
8,3,Woman 5,"How dare you?! 
"
8,3,Kyle,"Look out!! 
"
8,3,Mel,"Give me my eighteen dollars!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!
"
8,3,Mel,"Ha!  So! You boys have led me here to your secret base, huh? I guess now you're gonna start torturing me! Well!  Oh, my nipples are so tender! Don't squeeze them anymore!
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"That's... Mel Gibson?
"
8,3,Jack,"H- he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.
"
8,3,Mel,"Yeah...  I'll bet you wanna torture me now, don't you?!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Dude, what's wrong with him?
"
8,3,Stan,"He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
"
8,3,Mel,"You! You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you?  Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there, I can take it!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
"
8,3,Mel,"Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars!
"
8,3,Stan,"It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!
"
8,3,Mel,"You can't say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked!
"
8,3,Stan,"No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
"
8,3,Jack,"You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ.
"
8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times. We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. 
"
8,3,Mel,"Woohoohoo! Woohoohoohoohoo! 
"
8,4,Cartman,"Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. 
"
8,4,Kyle,"Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. 
"
8,4,Stan,"Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. 
"
8,4,Kyle,"Hey, who are those kids? 
"
8,4,Boombox,"Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!Let's see you...! Let's see you...!Let's see you...! Let's see you...!Daaance, sucka!Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance-
"
8,4,OC Leader,"Yeah, how you like that y'all! 
"
8,4,OC Member 1,"Let's bring it to these losers.
"
8,4,OC Girl,"Aww yeah! 
"
8,4,OC Leader,"Whatchoo got, huh?! You got nothin'!  Damn! You just got served!  Aww man! 
"
8,4,OC Girl,"He got you, dude.
"
8,4,OC Leader,"Now that kid is gettin' served!
"
8,4,OC Girl,"Uh huh. 
"
8,4,OC,"Whoa! 
"
8,4,OC Leader,"Aww man, look at them! They know they can't trip to that!  Yeah! We're outta here!
"
8,4,OC Member 2,"That was smokin'!
"
8,4,OC Member 1,"They didn't do nothin'!
"
8,4,OC Member 3,"Sorry y'all, but try not to let it sting too bad! 
"
8,4,OC Leader,"You got served!  Come on! They had nothin'! Let's go y'all!
"
8,4,OC Member,"Come on y'all! 
"
8,4,Kyle,"...What the hell just happened?
"
8,4,Chef,"Oh. Hello there, children!
"
8,4,Stan,"Chef, we just got served.
"
8,4,Chef,"Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa.
"
8,4,Chef,"Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe.  Are you all okay?
"
8,4,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
8,4,Chef,"All right. Now, where did you get served?
"
8,4,Stan,"Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-
"
8,4,Chef,"Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay.  Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
"
8,4,Sharon,"Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay.
"
8,4,Randy,"What's the matter with him?
"
8,4,Sharon,"Oh. Stan got served at school today.
"
8,4,Randy,"You got served? By who?
"
8,4,Stan,"Some, kids from Orange County.
"
8,4,Sharon,"Let's not make a big deal out of it.
"
8,4,Randy,"So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
"
8,4,Stan,"No.
"
8,4,Randy,"What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?
"
8,4,Sharon,"That was the right thing to do.
"
8,4,Randy,"No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.
"
8,4,Stan,"But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
"
8,4,Randy,"Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!
"
8,4,Stan,"But Dad-
"
8,4,Randy,"Now! 
"
8,4,Randy,"All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight. 
"
8,4,Kyle,"Dude, that is a sweet RC car!
"
8,4,Stan,"Yeah, let's go race it right now!
"
8,4,OC Member 2,"Well, what we got here?
"
8,4,OC Member 1,"It's the white boys that were served yesterday. 
"
8,4,OC Leader,"You want a little more, homeboys?
"
8,4,Kyle,"We're not interested, thanks.
"
8,4,OC Member 1,"You're not interested? Not interested in this? 
"
8,4,Boombox,"You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.You can’t burn with my group so don’t light it.I'm on the OC crew and I'm better than you.You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.You can't bop her like me so don't go there.
You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.
I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.
I'm a good listener and that's rare.
"
8,4,Black Man,"Oh Lord, look at those moves.
"
8,4,Black Woman,"Oooo, they are takin' it out!
"
8,4,Black Man 2,"Oh man, they are getting served!
"
8,4,Black Woman 2,"Ooooo, it's getting hot out here!
"
8,4,Black Man 3,"Have mercy! 
"
8,4,Others,"Oooooo, look at that! Lord! Gettin' served! 
"
8,4,Kyle,"Yeah! Go Stan!
"
8,4,Chef,"Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'! 
"
8,4,Kyle,"All right Stan!
"
8,4,Cartman,"Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
"
8,4,OC Leader,"Wha?
"
8,4,Kyle,"Yeah! You got served!
"
8,4,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
8,4,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
8,4,Kyle,"That's right!
"
8,4,Cartman,"All right!
"
8,4,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
8,4,Chef,"No no no!
"
8,4,OC Leader,"Okay. All right. We got served. So now, I guess... It's on.
"
8,4,Stan,"What?
"
8,4,OC Member 1,"This Saturday! Our top five dancers against your top five dancers! OC Convention Center. It's on!
"
8,4,OC Members,"It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!
"
8,4,Townsman,"Oh Lord it's on!
"
8,4,Chef,"Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.
"
8,4,OC Member 3,"We'll see you Saturday, fools! 
"
8,4,OC Members,"Yeah, and you'd better have a lot better dancers with you than those loozas! 'Cause it's on!
"
8,4,OC Members,"It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on! 
"
8,4,Chef,"Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?
"
8,4,Stan,"I thought I was supposed to!
"
8,4,Chef,"Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!
"
8,4,Stan,"But why?
"
8,4,Chef,"Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??
"
8,4,Sharon,"Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!
"
8,4,Randy,"What?
"
8,4,Sharon,"Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!
"
8,4,Randy,"So what happened?
"
8,4,Sharon,"It's on! 
"
8,4,Coach,"Come on now, keep it tight!  Good. Now watch that timing, drill team! 
"
8,4,OC Member 1,"All right!
"
8,4,OC Girl,"All right!
"
8,4,OC Leader,"Yeah, bad ass!
"
8,4,OC Member 2,"Yeah, that was tight!
"
8,4,Coach,"Not bad, kids. Not bad. 
"
8,4,OC Member 1,"Not bad? South Park doesn't stand a chance!
"
8,4,OC Girl,"I heard that!
"
8,4,Coach,"All right, it was good. But we don't want ""good,"" we want pain!
"
8,4,Randy,"Uh, hey, ex- excuse me.
"
8,4,Coach,"Yeah?
"
8,4,Randy,"Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father.
"
8,4,Coach,"Oh, so you're the father of the boy who's gonna get f'd in the a on Saturday?
"
8,4,OC Member 3,"Dang!
"
8,4,OC Leader,"Oooooo!
"
8,4,Randy,"Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on.
"
8,4,Coach,"Oh, it's on!
"
8,4,Randy,"No, no, no, it's not on.
"
8,4,Coach,"Whoo, it's on all right!
"
8,4,Randy,"It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.
"
8,4,Coach,"It's on!
"
8,4,Randy,"I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. 
"
8,4,Coach,"Hold on a second, clam-head!  You think you can just roll in here and tell us it's not on when it very clearly is on?! You're just trying to make us not practice, aren't you?! Because you know that your kids are goin' down when my kids give them this! Give me some moves out, Girl T!  Check this out!  Yeah! You like that?!
"
8,4,OC Leader,"Oooo man! 
"
8,4,OC Member 1,"Ohhh Lord! 
"
8,4,OC Leader,"Oooo, he is gettin' served! 
"
8,4,Randy,"Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.
"
8,4,Sharon,"Randy?  Randy, oh my God!
"
8,4,Skeeter,"What happened to him, Doctor?
"
8,4,Dr. Doctor,"He got served. Worst I've ever seen.
"
8,4,Jimbo,"Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce.
"
8,4,Chef,"Oh Lord...
"
8,4,Randy,"His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.
"
8,4,Nurse,"Shh. Relax, Mr. Marsh. 
"
8,4,Dr. Doctor,"We just got the X-rays back.  He mostly got served here  and here . But the worst serving was here in the pelvis region. The road to recovery will be a long one.
"
8,4,Jimbo,"Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?
"
8,4,Skeeter,"Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready to pounce on them after what they did to his father! 
"
8,4,Stan,"I, I don't know. He seems all right.
"
8,4,Mr. Garrison,"I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!
"
8,4,Randy,"Stan? Stan?
"
8,4,Stan,"Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad.
"
8,4,Randy,"Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.
"
8,4,Stan,"Okay, good.
"
8,4,Randy,"But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. 
"
8,4,Stan,"God dammit!
"
8,4,Stan,"Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?
"
8,4,Michael,"Of course we know how to dance.
"
8,4,Stan,"Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?
"
8,4,Pete,"Dance troupe? Please.  We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school.  Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.
"
8,4,Michael,"Yeah.  The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette. 
"
8,4,Stan,"Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.
"
8,4,Pete,"No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.
"
8,4,Stan,"Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?
"
8,4,Pete,"I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.
"
8,4,Henrietta,"Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.
"
8,4,Firkle,"I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest nonconformist of all.
"
8,4,Michael,"I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you. Okay, I'll do it. 
"
8,4,Stan,"Great! 
"
8,4,Henrietta,"Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.
"
8,4,Pete,"Yeah. We just got Goth-served.
"
8,4,Stan,"All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.
"
8,4,Michael,"We should go to the arcade. 
"
8,4,Stan,"The arcade?
"
8,4,Michael,"Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao. He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game. 
"
8,4,Stan,"Dude, he's incredible.
"
8,4,Michael,"He should be. He's here playing that game every single day after school. I think he's spent about six thousand dollars on it so far. 
"
8,4,Stan,"Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?
"
8,4,Yao,"You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do?
"
8,4,Stan,"Yeah.
"
8,4,Yao,"That's stupid. 
"
8,4,Stan,"Dude, we need you.
"
8,4,Yao,"I can't dance without the machine.
"
8,4,Stan,"It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
"
8,4,Yao,"Okay. I'll give it a shot.
"
8,4,Stan,"All right, that's three!
"
8,4,Michael,"Dude, we need a girl.
"
8,4,Stan,"Huh?
"
8,4,Michael,"We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags.
"
8,4,Stan,"Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
"
8,4,Porsche,"Hi guys, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?
"
8,4,Stan,"Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
"
8,4,Maury,"You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls. 
"
8,4,Stan,"And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
"
8,4,Mercedes,"Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else.
"
8,4,Stan,"So you'll do it?
"
8,4,Mercedes,"Why not?
"
8,4,Stan,"All right, we just need one more person!
"
8,4,Mercedes,"Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing.
"
8,4,Stan,"What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
"
8,4,Mercedes,"I think his name was...  Leopold... Stotch or something?
"
8,4,Stan,"Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...
"
8,4,Butters,"Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-
"
8,4,Linda,"Butters, you have some visitors. 
"
8,4,Butters,"Oh well, hi there everybody. 
"
8,4,Stan,"Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.
"
8,4,Butters,"Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
"
8,4,Stan,"It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. 
"
8,4,Butters,"...No.
"
8,4,Stan,"But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.
"
8,4,Butters,"No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!
"
8,4,Linda,"Butters?  Butters?! 
"
8,4,Stan,"We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
"
8,4,Linda,"Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.
"
8,4,Mercedes,"A tragedy?
"
8,4,Butters,"Waaaaah!
"
8,4,Linda,"I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go.
"
8,4,Stan,"Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?
"
8,4,Yao,"Hey I heard about this guy in Como who has a duck that can dance.
"
8,4,Stan,"A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.
"
8,4,Butters,"Aaaaah!  Aaaaah!
"
8,4,Stan,"All right, so you're sure he can dance?
"
8,4,Rancher,"Oh yeah. There he is. That's Jeffy.
"
8,4,Yao,"That don't look like a dancing duck to me.
"
8,4,Rancher,"Well, that's 'cause it needs music. Here y-here ya go, Jeffy. You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honeeey.You'll do a line and I'll do a line, babe.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, we'll fight an' screw 'til the mornin' time.
Honey, babe, be mine.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honey-
"
8,4,Stan,"Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?
"
8,4,Rancher,"No no, he'll dance to anything. See?
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, honeeey.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, babe.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, we'll fight an' screw all night and day.
Honey, babe, be mine.
"
8,4,Stan,"My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.
"
8,4,Linda,"Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.
"
8,4,Butters,"Two years ago. Two years ago!
"
8,4,Announcer,"That was Beverly Long from Indianapolis, folks. Let her hear it!  All right, and now, dancing to the song ""I've Got Something In My Front Pocket For You,"" here is Colorado state champion, Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch! 
"
8,4,Singer,"I've got something in my front pocket for youWhy don't you reach down in my pocket and see what it isThen grab onto it, it's just for youGive a little squeeze and say, ""How do you do?""
There's something in my front pocket, There's something in my front pocket,
There's something in my front pocket-
"
8,4,Butters,"Whoops. 
"
8,4,Woman,"Paul. Paul! 
"
8,4,Butters,"Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!  No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!
"
8,4,Chef,"All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!  We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be.  I think we should-  Whoa.  This... is the dance troupe?
"
8,4,Stan,"Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.
"
8,4,Chef,"Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do! 
"
8,4,Boombox,"You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.You can’t burn with my group so don’t light it.
I'm on the East-side crew and I'm better than you.
You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.
You can't bop her like me so don't go there.
You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.
I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.
I'm a good listener and that's rare.
"
8,4,Chef,"Oh Lord have mercy.  Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart.  No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent.
"
8,4,Stan,"We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?
"
8,4,Yao,"What? I don't wanna get served.
"
8,4,Mercedes,"Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served.
"
8,4,Stan,"Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- 
"
8,4,Chef,"All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. 
"
8,4,Butters,"What do you want?
"
8,4,Stan,"I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.
"
8,4,Butters,"Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up.
"
8,4,Stan,"Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
"
8,4,Butters,"Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
"
8,4,Stan,"Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault
"
8,4,Butters,"Yeah well, you tell that to their families. 
"
8,4,Stan,"Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
"
8,4,Butters,"I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!
"
8,4,Stan,"Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
"
8,4,Butters,"What?
"
8,4,Stan,"And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
"
8,4,Butters,"Aaaah!
"
8,4,Stan,"But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying ""Haha! I'm better than you!"" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.
"
8,4,Butters,"Get out of my room, Stan.
"
8,4,Stan,"Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. 
"
8,4,MC,"Yeah, make some noise!  Ladies and Gentlemen,  man, you are all in for a treat! Whichever crew wins tonight, you wanna remember their faces, 'cause the next time you see them... will be in Lil Kim's next video! Give it up for Lil Kim! 
"
8,4,Lil Kim,"What's up, niggaz?! 
"
8,4,MC,"This is gonna be a rough battle, y'all. So let's give it up for the OC Crew!  And the challengers, the South Park Diggitys!
"
8,4,Jimbo,"Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.
"
8,4,Mr. Garrison,"Aww, yeah.
"
8,4,MC,"A'ight y'all. It's showtime!
"
8,4,Announcer,"Dancers to the floor! 
"
8,4,Mercedes,"Stan. Stan, we have a big problem!
"
8,4,Stan,"What?
"
8,4,Mercedes,"It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle. 
"
8,4,Stan,"What happened??
"
8,4,Mercedes,"He was practicing the six-eight count and slipped on the floor.
"
8,4,OC Member 3,"Come on, fools! You dancin' or what?!
"
8,4,Yao,"Can he move it? 
"
8,4,Stan,"Aw, what do we do, Chef?!
"
8,4,Chef,"Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit.
"
8,4,OC Member 1,"Looks like they ain't even gonna dance.
"
8,4,OC Leader,"They're too scared! Looks like they already got served! 
"
8,4,Butters,"Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
"
8,4,Stan,"Butters! 
"
8,4,Chef,"All right!
"
8,4,MC,"All right come on, let's do this! DJ! Give us a hot track! 
"
8,4,CD,"Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Daaance, sucka!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance. 
"
8,4,Butters,"Waaah!  No! Jesus, not again!
"
8,4,OC Member 1,"Aaaah!
"
8,4,OC Member 3,"Get out of here! 
"
8,4,MC,"Folks, it looks like the OC crew is dead.  That means the winner is the South Park Diggitys!
"
8,4,Skeeter,"Woo!
"
8,4,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah!
"
8,4,Jimbo,"All right!
"
8,4,Chef,"All right! We did it! 
"
8,4,Stan,"All right Butters!
"
8,4,Yao,"You did it!
"
8,4,Randy,"You did it, son! You did it!
"
8,4,Cartman,"All right, Butters! 
"
8,4,Butters,"No! No! Noooooo!
"
8,5,Butters,"What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  ""To Butters Stotch.""  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? ""Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa.""  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
"
8,5,Butters,"Whoa...
"
8,5,Cartman,"I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
"
8,5,Butters,"You... you're my robot?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Yes. I will be your new best friend.
"
8,5,Butters,"Oh wow!
"
8,5,Butters,"Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Really?
"
8,5,Butters,"Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
"
8,5,Butters,"Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
"
8,5,Cartman,"That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
"
8,5,Butters,"Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Oh, really?
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Heh. Wow, that sucks.
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
"
8,5,Butters,"No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
"
8,5,Cartman,"What?
"
8,5,Butters,"When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
"
8,5,Cartman,"You saw that?
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Nuh uh.
"
8,5,Butters,"I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
"
8,5,Cartman,"No way.
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
"
8,5,Cartman,"...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
"
8,5,Butters,"Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
"
8,5,Butters,"How come?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
"
8,5,Butters,"Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch!
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.
"
8,5,Linda,"Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.
"
8,5,Stephen,"Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes. 
"
8,5,Butters,"That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
"
8,5,Linda,"Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.
"
8,5,Butters,"Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.
"
8,5,Linda,"Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?
"
8,5,Butters,"Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?
"
8,5,Linda,"That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
"
8,5,Butters,"Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! 
"
8,5,Linda,"Aw, that's just adorable.
"
8,5,Stephen,"It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over.
"
8,5,Butters,"I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
"
8,5,Butters,"Oh. Yeah.
"
8,5,Cartman,"I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?
"
8,5,Butters,"Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?
"
8,5,Cartman,"What?
"
8,5,Butters,"Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.
"
8,5,Butters,"Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
"
8,5,Cartman,"...No way.
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Weak! 
"
8,5,Butters,"Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Lame!
"
8,5,Butters,"All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.
"
8,5,Butters,"Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Where is it? Where is it?!
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O?!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Wah!
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
"
8,5,Butters,"Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O understands.
"
8,5,Butters,"Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!
"
8,5,Butters,"Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"I would like some Sunny Delight too.
"
8,5,Butters,"Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O will answers the door. 
"
8,5,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing, fatass?
"
8,5,Stan,"Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.
"
8,5,Kyle,"Why?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
"
8,5,Kyle,"Why?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?
"
8,5,Butters,"Who's at the door, AWESOM-O? 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
"
8,5,Butters,"Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.
"
8,5,Stan,"Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Weak.
"
8,5,Butters,"He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Yes, of course. 
"
8,5,Kyle,"Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Suck my balls, Kyle. 
"
8,5,Butters,"He's made in Japan!
"
8,5,Linda,"Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great.
"
8,5,Liane,"Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately.
"
8,5,Linda,"Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.
"
8,5,Liane,"Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.
"
8,5,Linda,"Excuse me, I didn't catch that.
"
8,5,Liane,"Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.
"
8,5,Linda,"Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! 
"
8,5,Linda,"Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged: you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!
"
8,5,Butters,"Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
"
8,5,Cartman,"What?
"
8,5,Butters,"Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Lame.
"
8,5,Uncle Budd,"Hey Nellie, guess what I found scrampin' around the airport. 
"
8,5,Butters,"Hi Aunt Nellie! 
"
8,5,Aunt Nellie,"There's my little nephew! How was your flight? 
"
8,5,Butters,"It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!
"
8,5,Aunt Nellie,"Didn't ya bring any bags?
"
8,5,Butters,"Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.
"
8,5,Aunt Nellie,"Your robot?
"
8,5,Uncle Budd,"Butters' new friend is a little strange. He, he really takes playing Robot seriously. 
"
8,5,Butters,"There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. 
"
8,5,Aunt Nellie,"Hello! It's nice to have you here.
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?
"
8,5,Aunt Nellie,"Oh oh, right through there, Mr. Robot.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Thank you. 
"
8,5,Uncle Budd,"I don't think he took the costume off the entire trip.
"
8,5,Aunt Nellie,"Well, did you wanna get right to sight-seeing, or are you guys hungry after such a long flight.
"
8,5,Butters,"Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.
"
8,5,Aunt Nellie,"Right...
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. 
"
8,5,Butters,"Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Argh! 
"
8,5,Butters,"I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind- That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot ...friend.
"
8,5,Butters,"Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? 
"
8,5,Producer,"Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right?
"
8,5,Mitch,"We're really smart.
"
8,5,Producer,"We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family.  Hey, what's that over there? 
"
8,5,Woman,"Wow, that's a really neat little robot you have there, little boy.
"
8,5,Girl,"What's he do?
"
8,5,Butters,"Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?
"
8,5,Cartman,"The New Orleans Saints. 
"
8,5,Boy,"Hey, Mr. Robot, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Seventeen. 
"
8,5,Producer,"Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
"
8,5,Mitch,"Yeah. Maybe that robot can be programmed to come up with movie ideas! 
"
8,5,Producer,"Exactly! 
"
8,5,Producer,"Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen what it can do.
"
8,5,Staffer 1,"Uh, excuse me sir, but uh, that's not a robot.
"
8,5,Producer,"It's not?
"
8,5,Staffer 1,"No, it clearly had bipedal movement, so the correct term is ""computerized automatron.""
"
8,5,Mitch,"Oh, very nice, Mitch.
"
8,5,Staffer 2,"You are the smart one.
"
8,5,Producer,"Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas.
"
8,5,Staffer 2,"How can a robot come up with better ideas for movies than us?
"
8,5,Producer,"Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.
"
8,5,Staffer 2,"Oh, perfect!
"
8,5,Staffer 3,"We'll call it ""Puppy Love""!
"
8,5,Staffer 2,"Give us another movie idea, AWESOM-O!
"
8,5,Mitch,"Yeah, yeah!
"
8,5,Staffer 3,"Let's hear it!
"
8,5,Mitch,"Yeah, we wanna hear it!
"
8,5,Staffer 3,"Come on, come on!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.
"
8,5,Staffer 3,"... Yes, it's flawless!
"
8,5,Mitch,"Punch-Drunk Billionaire!
"
8,5,Butters,"Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
"
8,5,Cartman,"You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
"
8,5,Butters,"Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Haaaa! Haaaa!
"
8,5,Butters,"Yoe, you okay AWESOM-O?
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.
"
8,5,Butters,"Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.
"
8,5,General,"Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty. The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever. Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk. Two days ago our intelligence department came across this:  The AWESOM-O 4000. It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies. Our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas, eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler. 
"
8,5,Black Official,"That's incredible!
"
8,5,White Official,"You're thinking the robot could be used to come up with anti-Islamic movies?
"
8,5,General,"No. If we got our hands on that robot, we could re-program it and turn it into a weapon!.
"
8,5,Black Official,"Yes, that might be the best thing to do.
"
8,5,White Official,"Uh huh. I don't see how we have a choice.
"
8,5,Scientist,"Hold on a second: If that robot is designed for entertainment, then, turning it into a weapon is unethical.
"
8,5,General,"Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand that the robot is from Japan! That means that the Japanese have more of them! And if the Japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before we do...
"
8,5,Black Official,"Jesus. It would be Pearl Harbor all over again.
"
8,5,White Official,"But worse. With robots.
"
8,5,Scientist,"I I'm sorry, I must protest. We, we have no data suggesting the Japanese have developed a robot with offensive capability.
"
8,5,General,"You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub.  Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles!  I want that robot!
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
"
8,5,Producer,"Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.  You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?
"
8,5,Cartman,"...What?
"
8,5,Producer,"Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O does not understand.
"
8,5,Producer,"Let me show you what I mean. 
"
8,5,Butters,"Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Lame!
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Not cool! Totally lame! 
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go? 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Waaaaa! 
"
8,5,Soldier,"Let's go! Move, move!
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
"
8,5,General,"Are those arm and leg locks secure?
"
8,5,Soldier,"Secure, sir!
"
8,5,General,"Good. I don't want that robot mobile until I know what it's capable of. All right, power it on. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!
"
8,5,Scientist,"What the hell?
"
8,5,General,"What's going on?
"
8,5,Scientist,"It... powered itself back on.
"
8,5,General,"Stand by. Be ready to destroy it. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!
"
8,5,Scientist,"Are your systems stable? Run a systems check on your CPU.
"
8,5,Cartman,"The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!
"
8,5,Scientist,"Ah, I'm sorry, robot,  they want me to reprogram you.
"
8,5,Cartman,"I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!
"
8,5,Scientist,"What did you say?
"
8,5,Cartman,"I said I'm a real person, asswipe!
"
8,5,Scientist,"...Oh my God. 
"
8,5,General,"What's happening?
"
8,5,Scientist,"The robot... It thinks it's alive. It's developed consciousness.
"
8,5,General,"What? How can that be?
"
8,5,Scientist,"Must be a malfunction of its exographical IMS or the... interlaced BV system.
"
8,5,General,"Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist!
"
8,5,Scientist,"Your robot doesn't know it's a robot!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Goddamnit, get me down from here! 
"
8,5,General,"Who made you, robot?
"
8,5,Cartman,"I'm not a robot, I'm a human!
"
8,5,White Official,"Jesus, the scientist was right.
"
8,5,General,"But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
"
8,5,General,"Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too.
"
8,5,Scientist,"Sure, why not? Program the memories of some eight-year-old boy who doesn't exist, and make the robot think he's real! Makes for a lot better movies! I'm not reprogramming a robot that's developed consciousness!
"
8,5,General,"Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don't forget you have a duty to your country,  Mr. Scientist!! I want that robot's memories and consciousness E-RASED, so we can take it back to Washington! GOT IT?! 
"
8,5,Scientist,"Damn you all to hell!
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!
"
8,5,Soldier,"It'll all be over soon, robot! 
"
8,5,Scientist,"Hang on! I'm getting you out of here, robot!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! 
"
8,5,General,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
8,5,Scientist,"Well I- I'm saving a conscious being! If you wanna kill it, you'll have to go through me!
"
8,5,General,"Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!
"
8,5,Cartman,"No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! 
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"I am the AWESOM-O 4000. 
"
8,5,Butters,"No!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world! 
"
8,5,Scientist,"There. You see? You want to tell me this isn't humanity? Who's to judge what makes something human anyway?!  Does this make me human?!  Or this?!  Or these?! 
"
8,5,General,"Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot. Maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence... is intelligence all the same, and we can learn from the robots. I think maybe one day we can all-  Hey, wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart?
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey, robots don't fart!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Uh... now ending fart sequence.
"
8,5,General,"Oh, and it, it smells, too!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Smell sequence initiated.
"
8,5,Black Official,"A robot with smelly farts? That doesn't make any sense.
"
8,5,Butters,"Hang on a second, here! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Would you like to touch my body?
Come on and touch my body!
Oooo, my hot body!
Don't you like my hot body?
Come on and touch my titties!
I felt them just like?
Come on Justin, touch my body!
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
Touch my body! You and me!
Check it out, my not-hot body!
Come on, my body!
"
8,5,General,"Wow, kid, you're a little faggot! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Lame...
"
8,6,Stan,"Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. 
"
8,6,Kyle,"Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
"
8,6,Cartman,"I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. 
"
8,6,Kyle,"Hey Look! 
"
8,6,Blanket,"Hello! 
"
8,6,Kyle,"Hey. Do you live here?
"
8,6,Blanket,"Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends?
"
8,6,Cartman,"No.
"
8,6,Blanket,"I really like your town. My dad wanted to move somewhere to get away from it all. He said he wanted peace and quiet, and to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything. 
"
8,6,Stan,"What's that you're wearing?
"
8,6,Blanket,"It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. 
"
8,6,Blanket,"Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
"
8,6,Cartman,"Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. 
"
8,6,Blanket,"We have arcade games inside. 
"
8,6,Blanket,"Dad?
"
8,6,Stan,"Whoa. Dude, no way!
"
8,6,Cartman,"Oh my God, this is awesome! 
"
8,6,Stan,"Dude, are these all your toys?
"
8,6,Blanket,"No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games.
"
8,6,Kyle,"Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do?
"
8,6,Blanket,"He's retired now.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!
"
8,6,Blanket,"Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard. 
"
8,6,Cartman,"Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
"
8,6,Blanket,"Dad? You out here?
"
8,6,Michael,"Here I am, Blanket!  Heeee!  Jeh chabee durtah!  Blanket! Oh my beautiful blanket!
"
8,6,Kyle,"What's wrong with his face?
"
8,6,Stan,"Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
"
8,6,Blanket,"Guys, this is my dad. Michael Ja-
"
8,6,Michael,"Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me?  Come on, let's climb the tree!  Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree! 
Have you been up my... Wishing Tree? Tuh!
It's where I come to think and dream.
And now I'd like to show you my... Wishing Tree. 
Jam on!
Where we can laugh and giggle and scream. 
Hee hee!
Imagination is the key.
"
8,6,Kyle,"Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.
"
8,6,Michael,"Won't you imagine along with me?
"
8,6,Kyle,"Mr. Jefferson? 
"
8,6,Michael,"We can be spacemen, 
or pirates on the sea
Chuckajamonah!
Yes we can do everything,
and I mean, everything!
Chuckajamonah!
Up in my Wishing Tree!
Hee hee! Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
"
8,6,Stan,"Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!
"
8,6,Red,"The Jeffersons?
"
8,6,Cartman,"They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! 
"
8,6,Kyle,"Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
"
8,6,Cartman,"They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
"
8,6,Craig,"No way.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
"
8,6,Craig,"I believe in Mr. Jefferson!
"
8,6,Michael,"Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!
"
8,6,Blanket,"Who wants the first cotton candy? 
"
8,6,Kids,"Memememememememememe... 
"
8,6,Michael,"Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!  Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!
"
8,6,Cartman,"Choo-choo train! Yay! 
"
8,6,Michael,"Let's ride the train! The train! 
Would you like to ride the train with me,
and start a magical journey?
"
8,6,Cartman,"Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
"
8,6,Michael,"Cartman, you have a beautiful voice.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
"
8,6,Michael,"Let's ride and ride on the train together
"
8,6,Cartman,"...Train together
"
8,6,Michael,"On a journey through both of our minds.
"
8,6,Cartman,"...I've got time. Do youuu??
"
8,6,Kyle,"Dude, what happened to your knee?
"
8,6,Blanket,"I fell down.
"
8,6,Kyle,"Mr. Jefferson!
"
8,6,Michael,"Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Choo-choo train.
"
8,6,Kyle,"Mr-&#160;! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. 
"
8,6,Kyle,"Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. 
"
8,6,Blanket,"Ow!
"
8,6,Kyle,"I know, I know. Be cool.
"
8,6,Blanket,"Thank you. That already feels better.
"
8,6,Kyle,"So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
"
8,6,Blanket,"I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.
"
8,6,Kyle,"And where is your mom?
"
8,6,Blanket,"I don't have a mom.
"
8,6,Kyle,"You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?
"
8,6,Blanket,"No. I was made in a laboratory.
"
8,6,Kyle,"What?
"
8,6,Blanket,"My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home.
"
8,6,Kyle,"So you never met your mom?
"
8,6,Blanket,"No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts.
"
8,6,Kyle,"Yeah. Yeah, that counts.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
"
8,6,Kyle,"You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
"
8,6,Cartman,"You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
"
8,6,Kyle,"Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! 
"
8,6,Randy,"Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.
"
8,6,Stan,"I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.
"
8,6,Sharon,"Oh, are they nice people?
"
8,6,Stan,"Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
"
8,6,Sharon,"Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.
"
8,6,Gerald,"So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?
"
8,6,Michael,"Kentucky, yeah.
"
8,6,Randy,"I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
"
8,6,Michael,"No, the- they're ignorant. That's ignorant.
"
8,6,Stephen,"What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?
"
8,6,Michael,"Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals
"
8,6,Sheila,"Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.
"
8,6,Michael,"I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child.
"
8,6,Randy,"....Yeeeah.
"
8,6,Sharon,"...They are fun.  Boys, you okay out there?
"
8,6,Stan,"Fine, Mom.
"
8,6,Blanket,"Wow, these are great. What are they called again?
"
8,6,Kyle,"They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
"
8,6,Blanket,"Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden. 
"
8,6,Cartman,"What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
"
8,6,Stan,"No, my parents are.
"
8,6,Cartman,"You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
"
8,6,Stan,"What?
"
8,6,Cartman,"He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
"
8,6,Gerald,"Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.
"
8,6,Randy,"Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?
"
8,6,Michael,"D'huh?
"
8,6,Stephen,"I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.
"
8,6,Michael,"I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men.
"
8,6,Gerald,"Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?
"
8,6,Michael,"Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doo-doo in their souls.
"
8,6,Harris,"Hey Sergeant, take a look at this.
"
8,6,Yates,"Whatcha got?
"
8,6,Harris,"Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money.
"
8,6,Yates,"So, what's the problem?
"
8,6,Harris,"Take a look. Says here...  He's black.
"
8,6,Yates,"By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.  Let's go people!  We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!
"
8,6,Stan,"Kyle? 
"
8,6,Michael,"Hey, Stan, whatcha doin'? 
"
8,6,Stan,"Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!
"
8,6,Michael,"Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.  T-shamon! 
I'm a little boy forever.  Hey!
"
8,6,Stan,"Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
"
8,6,Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
"
8,6,Stan,"He just showed up here.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. 
"
8,6,Stan,"Jesus Christ! 
"
8,6,Kyle,"Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.
"
8,6,Blanket,"Hi, Stan.
"
8,6,Kyle,"He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
"
8,6,Stan,"I know. He's here.
"
8,6,Kyle,"What?!
"
8,6,Michael,"Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party!
"
8,6,Stan,"No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
"
8,6,Michael,"We can't go home. There's a ghost in our house. Me and Blanket are scared.
"
8,6,Blanket,"Dad says it wants to eat us.
"
8,6,Michael,"Please don't make us go back home. Please! We're scared, we're scared!
"
8,6,Blanket,"We're scared!
"
8,6,Mr. Jefferson,"Hee hee!
"
8,6,Stan,"Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
"
8,6,Kyle,"Come on, Blanket. 
"
8,6,Michael,"Now let's all sleep and dream
Heehee!
of fun and adventurous things
shamonah!
It's time for us all to say goodnight
"
8,6,Cartman,"Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
"
8,6,Michael,"I think you're awesome too, Cartman. 
"
8,6,Cartman,"Yeah?
"
8,6,Michael,"Yeah.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Yeah?
"
8,6,Michael,"Yeah.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Yeah? 
"
8,6,Stan,"Haaa! 
"
8,6,Michael,"What's the matter, Stan? Did you have a bad dream?
"
8,6,Stan,"Yeah. A really bad dream.  Oh Jesus!
"
8,6,Yates,"Murphy, you inside?
"
8,6,Murphy,"We're inside, sir. Harris was right. This guy looks like he has more money than all of us put together. Black sonofabitch!  I'm planting the cocaine now. 
"
8,6,Yates,"Johnson, what about you?
"
8,6,Johnson,"Placing the blood spatter now, sir. 
"
8,6,Yates,"Frakes?
"
8,6,Frakes,"Placing pubic hair from the raped girl now, sir.
"
8,6,Yates,"All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras.  Why do we do it, Harris?
"
8,6,Harris,"Sir?
"
8,6,Yates,"Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?
"
8,6,Harris,"Oh, why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it.
"
8,6,Yates,"Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.
"
8,6,Randy,"Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!
"
8,6,Michael,"Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party. 
"
8,6,Randy,"Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!
"
8,6,Michael,"Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself.  Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars. 
"
8,6,Randy,"Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. 
"
8,6,Michael,"Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends. 
"
8,6,Sharon,"Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?
"
8,6,Stan,"You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
"
8,6,Cartman,"Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! 
"
8,6,Michael,"Come on, Blanket!
"
8,6,Yates,"Hey Har- Har- Harris! Harris!
"
8,6,Harris,"Wha- wha- what?
"
8,6,Yates,"It's Jefferson! He's back!  All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.  Whoa, wait a minute!  That guy isn't black!  Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus!  This is Yates! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black!  You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!
"
8,6,Harris,"It says right here on the final sheet he is!
"
8,6,Yates,"Does that look like a black guy to you?!
"
8,6,Harris,"It said on the final sheet!
"
8,6,Yates,"Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!  Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.  Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?
"
8,6,Harris,"Sir, it's possible that he is black, even though he doesn't look it.
"
8,6,Yates,"To hell with you! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I know he's black for sure!
"
8,6,Michael,"All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore! 
"
8,6,Kyle,"That poor kid.
"
8,6,Stan,"Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. 
"
8,6,Blanket,"Hi guys!
"
8,6,Kyle,"Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?
"
8,6,Blanket,"Really? You mean it?
"
8,6,Michael,"Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside and play, guys!
"
8,6,Stan,"Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
"
8,6,Michael,"Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!
"
8,6,Stan,"Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
"
8,6,Michael,"Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket?  Wee, look! He can fly!
"
8,6,Kyle,"Jesus Christ, dude!
"
8,6,Blanket,"Aaaaaah! 
"
8,6,Stan,"Stop, you fucking lunatic! 
"
8,6,Kyle,"Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!
"
8,6,Michael,"No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look.  Jeekabee durtah!  Ow!  There, Blanket, shhhh.  Hey, hey look, hey look.  I got your nose.  Look! Lookit, I got your nose. I got your nose, Blanket. See? 
"
8,6,Blanket,"Aaaaaaaah! 
"
8,6,Michael,"No, Blanket, stop!  It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!
"
8,6,Maggie,"Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry.
"
8,6,Yates,"I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force. 
"
8,6,Maggie,"Quitting the force? You?
"
8,6,Yates,"None of it makes sense anymore.  I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?! And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm just damn tired.
"
8,6,Maggie,"Not another word of that kind of talk, Harrison Yates.  Believe me I would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home. But I know you. Framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood. Wiping that rich, smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours. You're a good cop, Harrison Yates. You don't have to question that. Because I'm here to tell you. 
"
8,6,Yates,"And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself. 
"
8,6,Maggie,"Where're you goin'?
"
8,6,Yates,"Think I've got a little more work to do. 
"
8,6,Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
"
8,6,Michael,"No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!  I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!  But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!  Oh, I'm melting!
"
8,6,Kyle,"All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.
"
8,6,Kenny,"Yeah, sure, whatever. 
"
8,6,Stan,"You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
"
8,6,Kenny,"Aren't I too big to be Blanket?
"
8,6,Kyle,"I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! 
"
8,6,Stan,"Blanket, you in here?
"
8,6,Blanket,"Hi guys! 
"
8,6,Kyle,"Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? 
"
8,6,Blanket,"You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! 
"
8,6,Stan,"All right dude, get in his bed.
"
8,6,Kenny,"All right, but you guys owe me for this.
"
8,6,Stan,"Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. 
"
8,6,Snetzl,"Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl.
"
8,6,Yates,"Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado.
"
8,6,Snetzl,"Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?
"
8,6,Yates,"Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson?
"
8,6,Snetzl,"Hm. No, we never had a any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves.
"
8,6,Yates,"Well, he doesn't really look that black.
"
8,6,Snetzl,"Yeah, I don't, uh... Hold on a second. There was one we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial.
"
8,6,Yates,"You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?
"
8,6,Snetzl,"We, uhhh, found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges.
"
8,6,Yates,"Molestation, nice.
"
8,6,Snetzl,"Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with doodie feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm!
"
8,6,Yates,"That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine.
"
8,6,Snetzl,"Heh, yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure.
"
8,6,Yates,"Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!
"
8,6,Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
"
8,6,Kyle,"Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. 
"
8,6,Michael,"What are you doing with my Blanket?  Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee durtah! Hee! 
"
8,6,"Stan, Kyle, Blanket","Haaaaa!
"
8,6,Stan,"Go, go, ruuun! 
"
8,6,Mr. Jefferson,"Sutah!
"
8,6,"Stan, Kyle, Blanket","Haaaaa!
"
8,6,Michael,"Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!
"
8,6,Stan,"Oh Jesus!
"
8,6,Kenny,"What the hell is going on, you guys?
"
8,6,Michael,"My Blanket! Let's play, Blanket! 
"
8,6,Kenny,"Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!
"
8,6,Michael,"Wee, he can fly! He can fly!
"
8,6,Kenny,"Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A- 
"
8,6,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
8,6,Kyle,"You bastard! 
"
8,6,Michael,"Blanket? Blanket! Come play! 
"
8,6,Blanket,"Nooo! 
"
8,6,Kyle,"Come on!
"
8,6,Stan,"Run, Blanket, Run!
"
8,6,Blanket,"Ah!
"
8,6,Michael,"Dainduh! Dainduh Dainduh!
"
8,6,Kyle,"Hang on, Blanket! 
"
8,6,Mr. Jefferson,"Dugh! Heehee! Ja-!
"
8,6,Yates,"Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!
"
8,6,Cartman,"No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
"
8,6,Michael,"It's ignorant. 
"
8,6,Cartman,"Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
"
8,6,Kyle,"All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
"
8,6,Michael,"You're right. I've been so obsessed with my childhood that I've forgotten about his. I thought having lots of rides and toys was enough, but... Blanket doesn't need a playmate. He needs a father, and a normal life. Chickuckoo gainuh.  Blanket, I wanna give away all my money. I- I wanna get a normal job and... take a shot at raising you in a normal setting. 
"
8,6,Blanket,"Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.
"
8,6,Yates,"Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail.
"
8,6,Kyle,"All right! Things just might work out!
"
8,6,Michael,"Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change.
We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts'
And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays
And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start,
And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.
Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! OOOOH! Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! Jamonah! butcha-tamonah! Chich-cha!
"
8,7,Woman,"Yes?
"
8,7,Cartman,"Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
"
8,7,Woman,"Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?
"
8,7,Cartman,"Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
"
8,7,Woman,"How about fifteen dollars?
"
8,7,Cartman,"It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?
"
8,7,Kyle,"You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
"
8,7,Cartman,"Dude, I'm takin' a break.
"
8,7,Kyle,"A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
"
8,7,Cartman,"Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
"
8,7,Kyle,"All you ever do is talk about your balls!
"
8,7,Cartman,"It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?
"
8,7,Kyle,"If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
"
8,7,Cartman,"Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
"
8,7,Stan,"Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
"
8,7,Woman,"Oh goodness, what happened?
"
8,7,Cartman,"Shoveling accident.
"
8,7,Woman,"Oooh, no, come on inside.  Wait right here, I'll be right back. 
"
8,7,Cartman,"You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
"
8,7,Stan,"Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.
"
8,7,News Announcer,"This is breaking news. Here's Anchorman Aaron Brown. 
"
8,7,Aaron Brown,"Incredible, absolutely amazing news today. A man from the future has come back in time and is in a government hospital after being hit by a car.
"
8,7,Stan,"Whoa.
"
8,7,Aaron Brown,"Christina Naylon has more.
"
8,7,Christina Naylon,"The news is incredible, Aaron. Experts and scientists have been with the man from the future for several hours now, and have been able to learn that he is from the year 3045. His condition is stable, and speculation continues as to why he has come. Has he come to deliver a cure for cancer? Or to fix something wrong with the past?
"
8,7,Aaron Brown,"Have to interrupt you there, Christina. Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the base with breaking news. Brad?
"
8,7,Brad Morgan,"Aaron, the scientists have been able to communicate further and have uncovered that the man from one thousand years in the future has come to our time... looking for work. Uh, he has said that the future is so overwhelmingly overpopulated that there are simply no jobs in his time, and so he built a time portal and has come back to 21st century America, uh, to find a job here.
"
8,7,Aaron Brown,"Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He came back here for work?
"
8,7,Brad Morgan,"Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi- his plan is to get a job here, in our time, so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account, uh, which will earn interest, and by the year 3045 be worth billions of dollars, uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundreds of dollars, but uh, enough, he says, to feed his family.
"
8,7,Aaron Brown,"And now I understand we're going to Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation on how the time portal works. Harrison?
"
8,7,Harrison Moore,"Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow Terminator rules. That is, it's one way only and you can't go back. This is in contrast, say, to Back To The Future rules, where back and forth is possible, and of course, Timerider rules, which are just plain silly. Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay.
"
8,7,Stan,"Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
"
8,7,Randy,"We know, Stanley. We've been watching.
"
8,7,Aaron Brown,"If you're just joining us, a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a one-way time portal looking for work. Uh, the President is expected to give an announcement at any time.
"
8,7,Harrison Moore,"Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears that another person from the future has just arrived!  It looks as if the job at Wendy's did work for the original immigrant; this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off, and wishes the same for his family.
"
8,7,Sharon,"There you go. All set, sweetie?
"
8,7,Stan,"Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.
"
8,7,Sharon,"I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.  You've had a busy day.  Goodnight, sweetie.
"
8,7,Stan,"Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.
"
8,7,Mrs. Landis,"Yes?
"
8,7,Stan,"Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?
"
8,7,Mrs. Landis,"Ooo, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've already hired someone else to do it.
"
8,7,Cartman,"What?! Who?!
"
8,7,Mrs. Landis,"One of those immigrants from the future. He said he would do it for twenty-five cents.
"
8,7,Kyle,"Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
"
8,7,Stan,"All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. 
"
8,7,Kyle,"Dude. 
"
8,7,Stan,"Son of a bitch!
"
8,7,Aaron Brown,"Still more immigrants from the future arrived at the time border today, some even bringing their entire families. the purplish goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic side effect of the time-travel process. This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to learn even more about American life in the future. Chris Holt joins us now. Chris?
"
8,7,Chris Holt,"Yes, there are incredible things we're learning about Americans in the future, Aaron. I- it appears that in the future, Americans have evolved into a hairless uniform mix of all races. They are all one color, which is a yellowy light-brownish whitish color. Uh, it seems race is no longer an issue in the future, because all ethnicities have mixed into one. Perhaps most interesting is how this has affected their language. The people in the future speak a complete mix of English, Chinese, Turkish and, indeed, all world languages, which sounds something like this:  Back to you, Aaron.
"
8,7,Aaron Brown,"Apparently the people from the future are having a pretty easy time finding work. Since they offer to work for such low wages, they're being hired all over America.
"
8,7,Man 1,"This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"All right, folks, my name is Darryl Weathers and I'm with the Construction Workers' Union. I work with a lot of fine men who have families to feed. Now, I don't know about you all, but we worked long and hard to get our pay up to a level where we could make a decent living. And now these people from the future are showin' up and offerin' to do the same work for next to nothin'! They took our jobs! 
"
8,7,Man 2,"We're in the moving business! Fourteen years we've been workin' our butts off! Now these future folk come in and we can't get work nowhere! They took our jobs!
"
8,7,Man 3,"They took your jobs! 
"
8,7,Man 4,"Well what about us in the fast-food business?! The restaurants are firing us 'cause the future people work for a lot less! They took our jobs!
"
8,7,Other Men,"They took your jobs!
"
8,7,Stan,"It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!
"
8,7,Other Men,"They took yer jobs!
"
8,7,Sharon,"Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?
"
8,7,Stan,"I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh- 
"
8,7,Sharon,"Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner? 
"
8,7,Stan,"Who is that?
"
8,7,Randy,"That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.
"
8,7,Stan,"Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!
"
8,7,Sharon,"What?!
"
8,7,Randy,"Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!
"
8,7,Sharon,"Who taught you to talk like that?!
"
8,7,Stan,"Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
"
8,7,Randy,"They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
"
8,7,Stan,"I wanted my job!
"
8,7,Randy,"Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!
"
8,7,Sharon,"That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.
"
8,7,Stan,"Timecist?
"
8,7,Sharon,"You know, a racist, but against people from the-
"
8,7,Stan,"People from the future. Right, got it.
"
8,7,Randy,"All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.
"
8,7,Announcer,"And now, here is Bill O'- Reilly.
"
8,7,Bill O'Reilly,"Welcome, welcome to the No-Spin Zone, all right? And what we're talkin' about today are the immigrants from the future. All right? Now, most people are more than happy to give a helping hand to these people who obviously need it. All right? But others are starting to say that the time portal should be closed off. All right? Now, I've got two guests with me tonight who have opposing views on the matter. On my right is pissed-off, white-trash, redneck conservative.
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Thanks for having me, Bill.
"
8,7,Bill O'Reilly,"And on my left is aging, hippie, liberal douche.
"
8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,"Hello.
"
8,7,Bill O'Reilly,"Now, pissed-off redneck, you say we shouldn't allow anyone else through the time portal, all right?
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"You're Goddamned right! These people from the future are takin' all the work away from us decent present-day Americans!  They took our jobs!
"
8,7,Skynard Man,"They took our jobs!
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Those jobs belong to people from the present!
"
8,7,Bill O'Reilly,"All right. What say you, aging, hippie, liberal douche
"
8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,"Heh, it's typical for conservatives rednecks like these to view the immigrants as the problem, heh, but really, the problem is America. It is our greedy multinational corporations that keep everyone else in poverty. Your ancestors came to America as immigrants. What right do you have to turn these people away?
"
8,7,Bill O'Reilly,"All right, redneck, your rebuttal?
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"They took our jobs!
"
8,7,Skynard Man,"They took our jobs!
"
8,7,Stout Man,"Too-kourderb!
"
8,7,Herbert Garrison,"All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak.
"
8,7,Kyle,"What?!
"
8,7,Herbert Garrison,"So, with that in mind, let's continue our lessons on verbs. Remember that there are transitive verbs such as  ""The boy threw the red ball,"" which in Futurespeak of course, is  Everyone say it with me?  Aaand there are intransitive verbs, such as  ""The 11:15 bus from Denver arrived twelve hours late."" Or in Futurespeak, ""Vvut.""
"
8,7,The Kids,"""Vvut.""
"
8,7,Kyle,"Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!
"
8,7,Craig,"Yeah!
"
8,7,Stan,"That's right! 
"
8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,"Hey now, these immigrants have a right to retain their culture. Who are we to say our language is best? They deserve to have an education just as much as you do.
"
8,7,Herbert Garrison,"Thank you, aging, hippie, liberal douche.
"
8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,"You betcha. 
"
8,7,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
8,7,Herbert Garrison,"Okay, now let's get back to it, kids. What kind of verb is this?  ""The sad girl puts balls in her mouth."" Or, in Futurespeak of course, ""Gluch gligh balls glych gligh.""
"
8,7,Man 5,"This is bullcrap!
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Listen up, everybody! We've just received a reply from our congressman.  ""Dear intolerant rednecks, we sympathize with you all losing your jobs. However, we feel your solution of shooting everyone who crosses the time border is inhumane.""
"
8,7,Chet,"What? That's ridiculous!
"
8,7,Man 6,"They can't do that!
"
8,7,Man 7,"That was a good idea!
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"So it appears the government ain't gonna help us! Which means we gotta take matters into our own hands! The only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening!
"
8,7,Man 8,"Hey, that's right! If there is no future, then there'll be no people from the future to come back and take our jobs!
"
8,7,Man 9,"Take rjurbs
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"All right! So, any ideas how we can stop the future from happening? 
"
8,7,Chet,"How about we cause more global warming, so that in the future, the polar ice caps melt, and it ushers in a new ice age?
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"How the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age?!
"
8,7,Chet,"Well you know, the... global warming could bring on like a climate shift or somethin'?
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you know that?! Even if global warming were real, which all proven scientific data shows it isn't, it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen! You think an ice age can just happen all of a sudden-like?
"
8,7,Chet,"Well I was just tryin' to be helpful.
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Well help yourself to a fuckin' science book, 'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard! Now, come on people, we've got to think! Damnit, they took our jaorbs!
"
8,7,Many Men,"They took our jobs!
"
8,7,Kyle,"Aw, dude. 
"
8,7,Cashier,"Gaur da'ka?
"
8,7,Stan,"Can you speak in present-day English please?
"
8,7,Cashier,"Uh oh... Can I help... you?
"
8,7,Stan,"Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.
"
8,7,Cashier,"Chicken sandwich?
"
8,7,Stan,"No, a double cheeseburger and fries!
"
8,7,Cashier,"A cheeg- fry?
"
8,7,Stan,"What?!
"
8,7,Cashier,"A cheeg- fry?
"
8,7,Cartman,"We can't understand you, asshole! 
"
8,7,Manager,"Can I help you?
"
8,7,Stan,"I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!
"
8,7,Manager,"Chicken sandwich?
"
8,7,Stan,"No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!
"
8,7,Randy,"Stan Marsh!
"
8,7,Stan,"Aw- awwww!
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Come on, people, think! How are we gonna stop these immigrants from takin' our jobs!
"
8,7,Man 10,"Hey, I got an idea. Uh maybe we should all take off all our clothes, scramble into a big pile and start gettin' gay with each other.
"
8,7,Chet,"Did you say ""get gay""?
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Hey, yeah. Well that's not a bad idea!
"
8,7,Man 11,"What? Gettin' gay?
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Think about it: These people are from the future, right? Well, if we can git everyone to turn queer, then there won't be no children to have no children, and the people from the future won't exist to take our jobs!
"
8,7,Jimbo Kern,"I ain't turnin' queer.
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"You have to, Jimbo, or else we won't be able to stop them! They too 'r jaobs!
"
8,7,Man 2,"Yeah, they took our jobs!
"
8,7,Man 8,"Took our jobs!
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Let's go over to that part of town that all the future people moved into and start humpin' each other until they disappear! Come on!  Come on! You want your jobs back or not?! 
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"All right, you future bastards! Think you can take our jubs?! Well, we'll show you! Come'ere, Earl!.  How do you like that, gooback?!  Come on, you guys!  Everyone who believes in America, join in with us! We're gonna make these future bastards nonexistent!
"
8,7,Stan,"Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?
"
8,7,Randy,"Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! 
"
8,7,Boss,"You'll find all the copiers and printers in the next room over and then uh-
"
8,7,Randy,"Hey, Mr. Nelson.
"
8,7,Mr. Nelson,"Oh... R- Randy... Uh, I'm surprised to see you here.
"
8,7,Randy,"Why? This is my office.
"
8,7,Mr. Nelson,"Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message? Ooo, this is awkward. Well, the thing is, Randy, you've been- replaced.
"
8,7,Randy,"What?
"
8,7,Mr. Nelson,"Well we found an immigrant from the future who knows geology and he offered to work for next to nothing. Uh, this is Mr. Glughgogawk.
"
8,7,Mr. Glughgogawk,"Gheglo.
"
8,7,Randy,"You can't be serious.
"
8,7,Mr. Nelson,"I'm... sssorry, Randy. It's just, with all the budget cuts and all, we'll give you some time to clean out your desk. Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk. I'll show you to the copy room. 
"
8,7,Randy,"Oh my God. They took my jarb!!
"
8,7,Stan,"They took yer jarb!!
"
8,7,Announcer,"This is CNN.
"
8,7,Aaron Brown,"Breaking news at the time border. We go now live to Harrison Moore.
"
8,7,Harrison Moore,"Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where some kind of mass protest has broken out.  Hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time immigrants are here having sex with one another.  These men have apparently sucked and screwed their way across the state and are now here at the time border trying to get national attention. These unemployed men have been having sex for several days. Joining me is their spokesperson, Randy Marsh.  Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
"
8,7,Randy,"We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Yeah America! 
"
8,7,Man 8,"Take our jobs!
"
8,7,Harrison Moore,"Do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?
"
8,7,Randy,"All we can do is try, Harrison.
"
8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,"Trying to stop immigration is intolerant and ignorant. Those immigrants have a right to pursue happiness.
"
8,7,Harrison Moore,"Young man, what do you think about all this?
"
8,7,Stan,"I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. 
"
8,7,Man 9,"Huh?
"
8,7,Stan,"I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.
"
8,7,Man 11,"Hey. He's right. If we build for a better future, the immigrants will stay there.
"
8,7,Man 12,"Yeah. We've got to start working towards a brighter tomorrow.
"
8,7,Randy,"Well what are we waiting for?
"
8,7,Singer,"We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future begins with you and me.
We can start to make a difference if we want it for our children
Recycle that can and plant that tree, 'cause the future begins with you and me.
"
8,7,Cartman,"Look, it's working! 
"
8,7,Singer,"The future begins with you and me.
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"The immigrants are fadin' away!
"
8,7,Stan,"We're doing it!
"
8,7,Singer,"We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.Take the first step and you will see the future-
"
8,7,Stan,"Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay.
"
8,7,Kyle,"This is really gay.
"
8,7,Cartman,"Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
"
8,7,Stan,"Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile. 
"
8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Back in the pile everyone!
"
8,7,Randy,"We're going back to the pile.
"
8,7,Man 13,"Jump in!
"
8,7,Man 14,"Come on, everybody!
"
8,7,Man 15,"Never mind, we're going back to the pile!
"
8,7,Man 16,"Took yer jurb!
"
8,8,Cheerleaders,"We are South Park, Green and White. Let's go, Cows! Fight, fight, fight! Nobody can beat a Cow! Let's gooo, South Park!
"
8,8,Red,"Hey, South Park! Do you have school spirit?
"
8,8,Students,"Moooooooo!
"
8,8,Bebe,"I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy?
"
8,8,Mandy,"Yeah, and South Park is really gonna stick it to Littleton next week!
"
8,8,Bebe,"Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going! 
"
8,8,Butters,"It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
"
8,8,Cartman,"Butters, shut the hell up! 
"
8,8,Blonde PeTA Woman,"We are People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals! We protest your insensitive use of cows as your school mascot!
"
8,8,Herbert Garrison,"Oh, Jesus, not PeTA again.
"
8,8,Dreadlocked PeTA Man,"Cows are maimed and slaughtered and used as a commodity! 
"
8,8,Blonde PeTA Woman,"This is the fate of the cow! This is your insensitivity!
"
8,8,Students,"Ewww! 
"
8,8,Gas Mask PeTA Member,"The cow is a slave! The cow is a commodity! To be thrown away by a society gone wrong!
"
8,8,Herbert Garrison,"All right, children, I have just been informed that since our school has been attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th time, we are going to change our school mascot.
"
8,8,Class,"Awwwwwwww!
"
8,8,Stan,"But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
"
8,8,Herbert Garrison,"That's right, Stanley, the eco-terrorists win.  Now, I have here a mascot selection sheet. Every student is supposed to check the box next to the mascot they like the most. And the most popular selection will be the school's new mascot.
"
8,8,Clyde,"But we like being the Cows! 
"
8,8,Dreadlocked PeTA man,"You're responsible for the enslavement and genocide of millions!
"
8,8,Herbert Garrison,"Ge-get outta here, PeTA! We're changin' the mascot already!
"
8,8,Dreadlocked PeTA man,"Who'll speak for those who cannot speak for themselves?!
"
8,8,Herbert Garrison,"Oh, ge-get outta here!  Ge-get out!  Jesus, where do they keep coming from?!  Go on, get outta here.
"
8,8,Stan,"This is bullcrap, dude!
"
8,8,Herbert Garrison,"Now children, it's not that bad. There's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians...
"
8,8,Wendy,"But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?
"
8,8,Herbert Garrison,"No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
"
8,8,Kyle,"Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Giant Douche.""
"
8,8,Cartman,"Ye-heah!
"
8,8,Kenny,"(Yeah, totally awesome!)
"
8,8,Cartman,"Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Turd Sandwich.""
"
8,8,Kyle,"Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
"
8,8,Kyle,"It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in ""Giant Douche!"" It's way funnier!
"
8,8,Cartman,"It is not!
"
8,8,Kyle,"Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?
"
8,8,Kenny,"(Giant douche.)
"
8,8,Cartman,"Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
"
8,8,Kyle,"Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?
"
8,8,Stan,"Dude, I really don't care. 
"
8,8,Kyle,"That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.
"
8,8,Cartman,"...Wait, wait, what about Butters?
"
8,8,Butters,"Huh?
"
8,8,Kyle,"You hate Butters.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
"
8,8,Butters,"Hahaha, a turd sandwich!
"
8,8,Kyle,"You misled him, fatass!
"
8,8,Cartman,"It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
"
8,8,Butters,"Yeah! ...What's this for? 
"
8,8,Kyle,"Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.
"
8,8,Jimmy,"That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea.
"
8,8,Kyle,"A giant douche.
"
8,8,Jimmy,"Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?
"
8,8,Cartman,"A turd sandwich.
"
8,8,Jimmy,"Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds.  Okay now, t-tell me the first one again?
"
8,8,Kyle,"Giant douche.
"
8,8,Jimmy,"And the second?
"
8,8,Cartman,"Turd sandwich.
"
8,8,Jimmy,"Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Better give it another ten seconds. All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one?
"
8,8,Kyle,"A giant douche.
"
8,8,Jimmy,"Okay, I think, that's it. Number 2?
"
8,8,Cartman,"Turd sandwich.
"
8,8,Jimmy,"Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Awwwww!
"
8,8,Butters,"Ohhh, we lost?
"
8,8,Kyle,"All right, it's decided. Let's all write in ""Giant Douche.""
"
8,8,Cartman,"Okay. You win, Kyle.
"
8,8,Herbert Garrison,"Attention students, we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets, and there will now be a school-wide vote between the top two nominations. So here is the first most-requested candidate, a giant douche. 
"
8,8,"Kyle, Kenny","Go, giant douche!
"
8,8,Giant Douche,"Hey, South Park! Have we got school spirit?!  We've got spirit, yes we do! Giant douches, me and you! Let's gooooo, Douches! 
"
8,8,Herbert Garrison,"And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich. 
"
8,8,Cartman,"All right turd sandwich!
"
8,8,Butters,"Yeah!
"
8,8,Kyle,"Cartman? What the hell?!
"
8,8,Cartman,"Giant Douche sucks!
"
8,8,Turd Sandwich,"We've got spirit, yes we do! We are sandwiches filled with poo! Yeeaahhh! 
"
8,8,Herbert Garrison,"Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.
"
8,8,Kyle,"You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
"
8,8,Cartman,"Game on, Jew-boy!
"
8,8,Butters,"Yeah, game on, Jew-boy! 
"
8,8,Kyle,"Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.
"
8,8,Kenny,"(Giant Douche! Vote for him!)
"
8,8,Kyle,"Giant Douche is your man!
"
8,8,Stan,"Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
"
8,8,Kyle,"Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. 
"
8,8,Cartman,"Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
"
8,8,Kyle,"There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
"
8,8,Stan,"I'm not voting!
"
8,8,Kyle,"What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!
"
8,8,Stan,"I just think this whole thing is stupid! 
"
8,8,Kyle,"Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.
"
8,8,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
8,8,Sharon,"How was school today, Stanley?
"
8,8,Stan,"It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
"
8,8,Sharon,"...What did you say?
"
8,8,Randy,"Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
"
8,8,Stan,"No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
"
8,8,Randy,"You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!
"
8,8,Sharon,"Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!
"
8,8,Stan,"Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
"
8,8,Randy,"You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
"
8,8,Sharon,"Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.
"
8,8,Randy,"You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
"
8,8,Sharon,"It's sexist, is what it is!
"
8,8,Randy,"You don't understand the issues, Sharon!
"
8,8,Sharon,"Are you calling me ignorant?!
"
8,8,Randy,"You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
"
8,8,Sharon,"I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch! 
"
8,8,Shelly,"I hate this family, I hate it! 
"
8,8,Stan,"Puff Daddy?
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"Your friend Kyle told me you don't understand the importance of voting.
"
8,8,Stan,"I...
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"Apparently, you haven't heard of my ""Vote or Die"" campaign. 
"
8,8,Stan,"""Vote or Die""?  What the hell does that even mean?!
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"What you think it means, bitch!
"
8,8,Stan,"Aaaah!
"
8,8,Posse,"Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"Rock the vote or else I'm gonna stick a knife through your eye.
"
8,8,Posse,"Democracy is founded on one simple rule!
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"Get out there and vote or I will motherfucking kill you. 
Yeah.
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"I like it when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
Shake them titties when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
I slam my jimmy through your mouth roof (mouth roof)
Now get your big ass in the pollin' booth.
I said vote, bitch, or I'll fucking kill you!
"
8,8,Posse,"Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"You can't run from a .38, go ahead and try!
"
8,8,Posse,"Let your opinion be heard! You gotta make a choice
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"'Cause after I slit your throat you won't have a fucking voice 
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"Vote or die! Vote or die!
"
8,8,Stan,"...Okay. I'll vote.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Hello, Clyde.
"
8,8,Clyde,"What do you guys want?
"
8,8,Cartman,"We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
"
8,8,Clyde,"I haven't decided yet.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?
"
8,8,Clyde,"Sure. 
"
8,8,Cartman,"Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
"
8,8,Butters,"A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 
"
8,8,Cartman,"You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
"
8,8,Butters,"Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
"
8,8,Cartman,"So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?
"
8,8,Clyde,"I'm still not totally sure.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? 
"
8,8,Kyle,"You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?
"
8,8,Stan,"I guess... 
"
8,8,Kyle,"Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.
"
8,8,Stan,"Okay. 
"
8,8,Kyle,"Woah... wait, what are you doing?
"
8,8,Stan,"I'm voting.
"
8,8,Kyle,"No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.
"
8,8,Stan,"Yeah, I know.
"
8,8,Kyle,"...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.
"
8,8,Stan,"I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
"
8,8,Kyle,"Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!
"
8,8,Stan,"Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!
"
8,8,Kyle,"Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!
"
8,8,Cartman,"Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.
"
8,8,Stan,"Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!
"
8,8,Principal Victoria,"We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him.
"
8,8,Randy,"Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!
"
8,8,Stan,"The whole thing is a joke!
"
8,8,Sharon,"You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.
"
8,8,Principal Victoria,"Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed.
"
8,8,Randy,"Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!
"
8,8,Principal Victoria,"No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible.
"
8,8,Randy,"Expulsion?!
"
8,8,Principal Victoria,"No. Banishment.
"
8,8,Stan,"B-bani-banishment?
"
8,8,Principal Victoria,"You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.
"
8,8,Sharon,"Oh, Randy!
"
8,8,Randy,"Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?! 
"
8,8,Stan,"You-you're all joking, right?
"
8,8,Mayor McDaniels,"As it was in the times of our forefathers, so it is now. Stan Marsh, for not following our most sacred of rites, you are hereby banished from South Park for all eternity. Or until you decide that voting is important. Good-bye, Stan. May the gods treat you more kindly than we did. 
"
8,8,Kyle,"Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.
"
8,8,Stan,"I'm not voting! 
"
8,8,A bodyguard,"Yo, Puffy man, are we just gonna let this happen?  We've gots to kill this non-votin' fool!
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"No, Justacious, let him go. He won't survive a fore-night in the wilderness. 
"
8,8,Randy,"This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.
"
8,8,Stan,"Dad, isn't this a little extreme?
"
8,8,Randy,"Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.
"
8,8,Bearded PeTA Member,"Look! What is that?
"
8,8,Blonde PeTA Member 2,"Oh, the poor thing!
"
8,8,Stan,"Hello? 
"
8,8,Blonde PeTA Member 2,"Don't worry, we'll free you.
"
8,8,Bearded PeTA Member,"Just sit still for a moment.
"
8,8,Stan,"Oh, thank God.
"
8,8,Bearded PeTA Member,"Get offa him, you filthy human! 
"
8,8,Blonde PeTA Member 2,"Poor thing needs water.
"
8,8,Bearded PeTA Member,"You're safe now.
"
8,8,Blonde PeTA Member 2,"Shame on you, making this horse your slave. 
"
8,8,Stan,"Awww!
"
8,8,Blonde PeTA Member 2,"Come, you can live with us.
"
8,8,Bearded PeTA Member,"We will give you food and shelter.
"
8,8,Stan,"What about me?
"
8,8,Bearded PeTA Member,"Open the gate! 
"
8,8,Blonde PeTA Member,"This poor creature is in need of food and water.
"
8,8,Balding Man,"You have a home here, friend.
"
8,8,Bearded PeTA Member,"The... kid wants to stay, too.
"
8,8,Stan,"I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
"
8,8,Balding Man,"I don't know if you can stay. We'll have to ask Dr. Cornwallis. Come.  We don't normally allow outsiders. See, here we live in harmony with animals. They're not our pets but our fellow living beings. We work with the animals and try to live as they do.  We make friends with the animals. We coexist, and we... intermarry.  This is my wife, Janice.  The outside world looks down on a man marrying a llama, but our love knows no boundaries. 
"
8,8,Stan,"Wow, you guys really love animals.
"
8,8,Balding Man,"And why not? Mark here has been with Kelly for three years now.  And Gary and Sally here have just managed to have a child together. 
"
8,8,Ostrich-baby,"Kill me...
"
8,8,Balding Man,"Yes, life here is good and natural. But now that you know where our compound is, you'll either have to live with us, or be murdered. 
"
8,8,Stan,"I'll live with you.
"
8,8,Balding Man,"It's not up to you. You'll have to talk with Dr. Cornwallis.  What did he say?
"
8,8,Stan,"He said I can stay.
"
8,8,Balding Man,"Excellent! Dr. Cornwallis is wise beyond his year. Here's your PeTA shirt and a bumper sticker. 
"
8,8,Announcer,"This is Debate 2004 with your host, Jim Lehrer.
"
8,8,Jim Lehrer,"Welcome to the cable-access televised debate between a giant douche  and a turd sandwich  We'll start with Giant Douche. Sir, some students and parents are reluctant to have a... giant douche represent them. What do you say to those people?
"
8,8,Giant Douche,"Jim, first of all I would like to thank you for monitoring this debate. And I would like to thank all of the students and their parents for coming.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.
"
8,8,Giant Douche,"But I would hope that those students and their parents who question my qualities would simply look at my opponent. He is a turd sandwich
"
8,8,Turd Sandwich,"You're a turd sandwich.
"
8,8,Giant Douche,"... No, sir, if you'll pardon me, you are in fact, the turd sandwich.
"
8,8,Turd Sandwich,"You're a turd sandwich.
"
8,8,Giant Douche,"... Sir, you are a turd sandwich.
"
8,8,Turd Sandwich,"You're a turd sandwich.
"
8,8,Jim Lehrer,"Ahh, Turd Sandwich, I will ask you not to speak out of turn.
"
8,8,Turd Sandwich,"I-I'm sorry, Jim.
"
8,8,Giant Douche,"Anyway, as I was saying, ahh... wait, I-I forgot what I was saying.
"
8,8,Turd Sandwich,"Ha. What a douche.
"
8,8,Jim Lehrer,"All right, Turd Sandwich, this next question is for you. How should South Park Elementary enforce its laws of conduct for young athletes during sporting events.
"
8,8,Turd Sandwich,"...Uh, you know, uh, my opponent wouldn't even know the answer to that question. If you ask him the same question, he would not answer it.  He would stand around and just babble on and on about nothing until he was finally saved by the buzze-. 
"
8,8,Jim Lehrer,"Your time is up, Turd.
"
8,8,Balding Man,"Stan, I want to introduce you to my stepdaughter, Teresa.  She seems to have taken a liking to you.  And she's ovulating.
"
8,8,Stan,"Ahh, no thanks, that's okay.
"
8,8,Balding Man,"Stan, some PETA members are growing concerned that maybe you don't love animals.
"
8,8,Stan,"I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.
"
8,8,Balding Man,"You... don't belong here, Stan. You should return home.
"
8,8,Stan,"I can't. I was banished for not voting.
"
8,8,Balding Man,"But, why on earth wouldn't you wanna vote?
"
8,8,Stan,"I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
"
8,8,Balding Man,"But Stan, don't you know? It's always between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Nearly every election since the beginning of time has been between some douche and some turd. They're the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics.
"
8,8,Stan,"I guess... I guess you're right. 
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"Yo, what did I say was going to happen to you, bitch? 
"
8,8,Stan,"Aaah!
"
8,8,Man in Shorts,"Aaaah!! He's wearing the skin of an animal!  Take that!  I... hope that teaches you a lesson about being hurt.
"
8,8,Puff Daddy,"Itius, Rodicus! 
"
8,8,Bodyguard,"Vote or die!
"
8,8,Stan,"Aaaah!! 
"
8,8,PeTA Man,"Protect the animals! Protect the animals! 
"
8,8,Balding Man,"Janice, we shall die together in each other's arms! 
"
8,8,Ostrich-baby,"Kill me! Kill meee!! 
"
8,8,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay... that's one more vote for Turd Sandwich.
"
8,8,Randy,"So who won, Mr. Mackey?
"
8,8,Mr. Mackey,"It's pretty close, but it looks like Giant Douche is gonna win.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Oh, no! Noooo!!
"
8,8,Kyle,"Ha! You lose, fatass!
"
8,8,Butters,"Uh hey, wait a minute! 
"
8,8,Randy,"Stan!
"
8,8,Sharon,"Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?
"
8,8,Stan,"I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
"
8,8,Randy,"He's going to vote!
"
8,8,Townsfolk,"He's going to vote. He's going to vote. 
"
8,8,Singer,"Let's get out the vote! Let's make our voices heard!
We've been given the right to choose between a douche and a turd.
It's democracy in action! Put your freedom to the test.
A big, fat turd or a stupid douche. Which do you like best?
"
8,8,Mr. Mackey,"Stan's vote bring the total votes for Turd Sandwich to... thirty six! And Giant Douche has... one thousand, four hundred, and ten. Giant Douche still wins!
"
8,8,Some Townsfolk,"Yeah! All right!
"
8,8,Other Townsfolk,"Aawwww!
"
8,8,Stan,"Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
"
8,8,Randy,"Hey! That's not true, Stan.
"
8,8,Sharon,"You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.
"
8,8,Randy,"Your vote still mattered.
"
8,8,Herbert Garrison,"Hey everybody!  They just found all the PETA members murdered at their compound! 
"
8,8,Mr. Mackey,"What the? They're all dead? Well, that means...
"
8,8,Clyde,"That we can go back to being the South Park Cows! 
"
8,8,All,"Hooray! All right!
"
8,8,Randy,"Now your vote didn't matter.
"
8,9,Cartman,"You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
"
8,9,Stan,"...What?
"
8,9,Cartman,"Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. 
"
8,9,Kyle,"That is fucking stupid, Cartman!
"
8,9,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!
"
8,9,Herbert Garrison,"Hey everybody, it's time!  It's time!
"
8,9,Townsfolk,"It's time. Oh, it's time? It's happening. It's happening now? Let's go! 
"
8,9,Stan,"It's time for what?
"
8,9,Herbert Garrison,"Get down to Metzger's Field! It's about to happen! 
"
8,9,Manager,"People of South Park I am pleased to be with you on this most historic day. A day you were certainly all remember... as the day your town... became great. The grand opening of the first South Park... Wall-Mart! 
"
8,9,Randy,"Look at it, honey. It's so big.
"
8,9,Herbert Garrison,"It's like we're a real town now. 
"
8,9,Cartman,"Whoa, awesome!
"
8,9,Kyle,"Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
"
8,9,Man,"Yeah! Now it's a Wall-Mart!
"
8,9,Manager,"I know that with the opening of the South Park branch of Wall-Mart, you will all see your town completely change...  Now, shop friends. Shop! 
"
8,9,Randy,"It's beautiful!
"
8,9,Marvin Marsh,"Welcome to Wall-Mart. Welcome to Wall-Mart. ...Welcome to Wall-Mart.
"
8,9,Sheila,"Sharon, isn't that your father?
"
8,9,Sharon,"Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.
"
8,9,Jimmy,"Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g- Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today?
"
8,9,Sharon,"Why yes, I'd love one, Jimmy. 
"
8,9,Chef,"My God. Look at all these incredible bargains.
"
8,9,Cartman,"Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
"
8,9,Kyle,"Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
"
8,9,Cartman,"Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
"
8,9,Kyle,"You only need one copy, r-tard!
"
8,9,Cartman,"Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
"
8,9,Kyle,"Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! 
"
8,9,Cartman,"Dude, you can't shop for crap. 
"
8,9,Woman,"I can't believe these bargains.
"
8,9,Manager,"Fools. Ignorant fools.
"
8,9,Randy,"Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters. 
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
"
8,9,Randy,"It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.
"
8,9,Whispers,"Six ninety-nine, fifteen dollars, free for fifteen ninety-eight...
"
8,9,Randy,"Aaaah!  Yeaaah... &lt;/&gt;
"
8,9,Sharon,"Randy, what are you doing?!
"
8,9,Randy,"Anu-nothing!  I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.
"
8,9,Sharon,"It's almost midnight.
"
8,9,Randy,"Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  I can all the bargains to myself! 
"
8,9,Elderly Woman,"Thanks for coming to Wall-Mart.  All are welcome. All are welcome! 
"
8,9,Cartman,"Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
"
8,9,Kyle,"Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. 
"
8,9,Mr. Farkle,"Oh, sorry boys. I'm going out of business.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Why, Mr. Farkle?
"
8,9,Mr. Farkle,"I can't compete with Wall-Mart's low prices. Everyone is shopping there now, and... well, I can't make ends meet.  I've got to sell the store and try to find another line of work.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Cartman, stop it!
"
8,9,Cartman,"What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
"
8,9,Mr. Farkle,"I appreciate your business, boys, but you'll have to try somewhere else in town. 
"
8,9,Kyle,"See?! That sucks, dude!
"
8,9,Cartman,"What? That's called progress, Kyle.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the- 
"
8,9,Cartman,"... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. 
"
8,9,Stan,"Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. 
"
8,9,Kyle,"What the hell? 
"
8,9,Stan,"Butters? 
"
8,9,Kyle,"Butters? What the hell are you doing?
"
8,9,Butters,"Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. 
"
8,9,Stan,"Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. 
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad?  Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?!
"
8,9,Randy,"Staaaan? 
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad, oh my God!
"
8,9,Randy,"Staan...
"
8,9,Stan,"What? D-dad, are are you dying?
"
8,9,Randy,"No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.
"
8,9,Stan,"But you-your face!
"
8,9,Randy,"Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  Here. It's a little turtle. 
"
8,9,Manager,"Come in?  Oh hello, fine shoppers.
"
8,9,Chef,"Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore.
"
8,9,Randy,"We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.
"
8,9,Manager,"What? What, you think I want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave.
"
8,9,Kyle,"But you run the Wall-Mart.
"
8,9,Manager,"Oh, you're wrong!  Wall-Mart... isn't run by anybody! First it reels you in with its bargains. Next thing you know you, you're workingbe at the Wall-Mart because it has all the jobs. Then you're sitting in a little office, trapped on all sides.
"
8,9,Chef,"They why don't you just quit?!
"
8,9,Manager,"Not so loud! It can hear you.
"
8,9,Kyle,"You hate Wall-Mart, too? 
"
8,9,Manager,"Aah!  I didn't say that! I love Wall-Mart! With all its... fantastic bargains and one-stop shopping, who can't love it, right?  Uh, Wa-Wall-Mart takes the hassle out of shopping and, and makes it both affordable and fun.  Ah-and Wall-Mart really gives back to the community! Us people are certainly happy to have a store like Wall-Mart, aren't we? 
"
8,9,Randy,"Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.
"
8,9,Gerald,"Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy! 
"
8,9,Cartman,"Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!
"
8,9,Sharon,"Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them.
"
8,9,Randy,"Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart.
"
8,9,Stan,"Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
"
8,9,Randy,"I know, I know! God!  Bleeeh! 
"
8,9,Stan,"Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- 
"
8,9,Shelly,"Oh, you stupid turd!
"
8,9,Randy,"Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!
"
8,9,Sharon,"We do?
"
8,9,Randy,"Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!
"
8,9,Stan,"But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-
"
8,9,Randy,"Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
"
8,9,Randy,"Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!
"
8,9,Gerald,"Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?
"
8,9,Randy,"Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!
"
8,9,Herbert Garrison,"Well what are you doing here, Randy?
"
8,9,Randy,"I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad!
"
8,9,Randy,"Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips... And butter.  And some new pliers.
"
8,9,Gerald,"Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here.
"
8,9,Jimbo,"It's like some mystical evil force.
"
8,9,Randy,"Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!
"
8,9,Herbert Garrison,"Let's burn it down!
"
8,9,Chef,"No, no, no! Let's freeze it!
"
8,9,Stephen,"I think it's best we try to reason with it.
"
8,9,Kyle,"No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.
"
8,9,Randy,"Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. 
"
8,9,All,"Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. Kumbaya, my Lord...
"
8,9,Cartman,"You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
"
8,9,Kyle,"It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.
"
8,9,Cartman,"No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?
"
8,9,Cartman,"Oh, awesome! 
"
8,9,Kyle,"How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?
"
8,9,Gerald,"We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.
"
8,9,Randy,"Can I help you? 
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?!
"
8,9,Randy,"You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad, you're a geologist!
"
8,9,Randy,"I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!
"
8,9,Driver,"Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.
"
8,9,Kyle,"But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!
"
8,9,Driver,"You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups.
"
8,9,Stan,"Where are they?
"
8,9,Driver,"Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are. 
"
8,9,Kyle,"Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!
"
8,9,Cartman,"Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. 
"
8,9,Stan,"Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.
"
8,9,Cartman,"Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
"
8,9,Kyle,"No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
"
8,9,Cartman,"Nuh-uh.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, ""Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along"" or something.
"
8,9,Cartman,"I am not, Kyle!
"
8,9,Stan,"Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. 
"
8,9,Kyle,"All right, fine. Come on, fatass! 
"
8,9,Cartman,"Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
"
8,9,Kyle,"I heard that!
"
8,9,Cartman,"You heard what?
"
8,9,Kyle,"You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
"
8,9,Cartman,"That's not what I said! 
"
8,9,Stan,"Dude, come on!
"
8,9,Kyle,"He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
"
8,9,Stan,"Dude, we have to go!
"
8,9,Kyle,"God-damnit! 
"
8,9,Stan,"Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!
"
8,9,Cartman,"Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!
"
8,9,Stan,"Goddamn, that took a long time.
"
8,9,Kyle,"It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
"
8,9,Cartman,"I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
"
8,9,Receptionist,"Can I help you?
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
"
8,9,Receptionist,"Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall-Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it.
"
8,9,Kyle,"We want to talk to who's in charge.
"
8,9,Receptionist,"In charge? I guess that would be Harvey Brown. He's the current president of Wall-Mart. One of the original creators.
"
8,9,Stan,"Where's he?
"
8,9,Harvey Brown,"We... invented the Wall-Mart Super Center in 1987. The idea was simple: build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low.  We didn't know what we were doing. In just four years, it was out of control.
"
8,9,Kyle,"So how do we stop it?
"
8,9,Harvey Brown,"You don't stop it.
"
8,9,Stan,"There has to be a way!
"
8,9,Harvey Brown,"There's nothing! Don't you understand?! Nothing can stop the Wall-Mart in your town! ...Unless... of course, you can find and destroy its heart.
"
8,9,Kyle,"The heart of Wall-Mart?
"
8,9,Cartman,"Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
"
8,9,Harvey Brown,"Every Wall-Mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. Destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process!
"
8,9,Cartman,"You speak too much, sir!
"
8,9,Stan,"Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
"
8,9,Harvey Brown,"Because the Wall-Mart stops you. Many have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature activists, even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the Wall-Mart and now. They are Wall-Mart shoppers all.
"
8,9,Kyle,"All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home. 
"
8,9,Harvey Brown,"It won't work, don't you understand?! It isn't gonna stop until there's nothing but Wall-Mart left! Jesus, what did we do?! What did we do?!  Boys!  Tell the world... I'm sorry! 
"
8,9,Stan,"No, dude, don't! 
"
8,9,Cartman,"That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!
"
8,9,Kyle,"All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.
"
8,9,Cartman,"I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!
"
8,9,Kyle,"I knew you were!
"
8,9,Cartman,"No, you didn't.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!
"
8,9,Cartman,"No, you didn't.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yes, I did!
"
8,9,Cartman,"No, you didn't.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yes, I did!
"
8,9,Cartman,"No, you didn't.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yes, I did!
"
8,9,Cartman,"No, you didn't.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yes. I did! 
"
8,9,Cartman,"...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
"
8,9,Kyle,"-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-
"
8,9,Cartman,"I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! 
"
8,9,Kyle,"We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! 
"
8,9,Cartman,"Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.
"
8,9,Marvin Marsh,"Welcome to Wall-Mart.
"
8,9,Stan,"Save it, Grandpa!
"
8,9,Kyle,"We've gotta find the television department. 
"
8,9,Randy,"Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
"
8,9,Randy,"Shhhhh! What are you talking about?
"
8,9,Stan,"One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
"
8,9,Randy,"Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God!
"
8,9,Stan,"What?!
"
8,9,Randy,"Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!
"
8,9,Stan,"Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! 
"
8,9,Randy,"Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! 
"
8,9,Kyle,"I think I see the television department in the back!
"
8,9,Stan,"Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!
"
8,9,Randy,"The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight!
"
8,9,Stan,"Come on, Dad!
"
8,9,Randy,"I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!
"
8,9,Stan,"No, dad! We need your keys!
"
8,9,Randy,"This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers! 
"
8,9,Stan,"There! The television department!
"
8,9,Wall-Mart,"Hello, boys. Congratulations on getting this far. 
"
8,9,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
8,9,Wall-Mart,"I am... Wall-Mart. 
"
8,9,Stan,"You?
"
8,9,Wall-Mart,"I've taken this form in order to talk to you. But I can take many forms.  Does this suit you better? Or perhaps you prefer this form?  I can take whichever form I like. 
"
8,9,Stan,"We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Where's the heart?
"
8,9,Wall-Mart,"To find the heart of Wall-Mart, one must first ask oneself, ""Who is it that asked the question?"" 
"
8,9,Stan,"Me. I'm asking the question.
"
8,9,Wall-Mart,"Ah, yes, but who are you?
"
8,9,Stan,"Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?
"
8,9,Wall-Mart,"Ah. You know the answer, but not the question!
"
8,9,Kyle,"The question is, ""Where is the heart?""
"
8,9,Wall-Mart,"Very well. You want to see the heart of Wall-Mart? It lies beyond that plasma-screen television. 
"
8,9,Stan,"It's a mirror.
"
8,9,Wall-Mart,"Yes, don't you see? That is the heart of Wall-Mart. You, the consumer. I take may forms: Wall-Mart, K-Mart, Target. But I am one single entity: Desire!
"
8,9,Stan,"Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. 
"
8,9,Wall-Mart,"Gaaah! No! No, what have you done?!  Now you shall see my true form!  Now you see me as I truly am!
"
8,9,Kyle,"We'd better get out of here. 
"
8,9,Chef,"Get out! It's gonna blow! 
"
8,9,Stan,"H-Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!
"
8,9,Randy,"Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!
"
8,9,Kyle,"The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out now! 
"
8,9,Herbert Garrison,"Boys, you did it! You killed the Wall-Mart!
"
8,9,Gerald,"How did you do it, Kyle?
"
8,9,Kyle,"All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
"
8,9,Chef,"We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns! 
"
8,9,Randy,"Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Duh.
"
8,9,Randy,"You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?
"
8,9,Gerald,"Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street! 
"
8,9,Crowd,"...Oh Lord, Kumbaya.
"
8,9,Randy,"All right, let's not make that mistake again.
"
8,9,Herbert Garrison,"Yeah, lets all shop over at True Value!
"
8,9,Crowd,"Let's go! Yeah! 
"
8,10,Clyde,"Yeah, and it was called Man from Atlantis, and he had like, webbed fingers... 
"
8,10,Stan,"Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Okay, hang on a second I-
"
8,10,Stan,"Right now, goddamnit!
"
8,10,Kyle,"All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you?
"
8,10,Stan,"Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. 
"
8,10,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
8,10,Kyle,"Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?!
"
8,10,Stan,"Yeah! He just got paroled!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Oh, no! No!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
"
8,10,Kyle,"Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Really? That's cool. When did-  What did you say?  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Oh, Holy Jesus, God...
"
8,10,Stan,"What the hell are we gonna do??
"
8,10,Butters,"Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
"
8,10,Cartman,"It's true.
"
8,10,Butters,"Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide!  Uh, oh boy! 
"
8,10,Cartman,"He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool
"
8,10,Stan,"Dude, let's play Fireman.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Jews can't be firemen.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Shut up, fatass!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!
"
8,10,Kenny,"(How about we put a real fire out?)
"
8,10,Stan,"Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!
"
8,10,Cartman,"But how do we start a fire?
"
8,10,Kyle,"Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! 
"
8,10,Trent,"Say Uncle!
"
8,10,Boy,"Uncle!
"
8,10,Trent,"Say Uncle!!!!!!
"
8,10,Boy,"Uncle! 
"
8,10,Trent,"What do you shitheads want?!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Do you know how to start a fire?
"
8,10,Trent,"Sure! I burn lots stuff.
"
8,10,Stan,"Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
"
8,10,Kyle,"We're firemen!
"
8,10,Trent,"Do you fuckheads even know how to put out a fire?
"
8,10,Stan,"Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Don't worry, Trent.
"
8,10,Trent,"All right, fine. 
"
8,10,Butters,"Hey fellas, you'd better be careful.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
"
8,10,Butters,"Oh, all right then. 
"
8,10,Stan,"Wow, cool!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Code 7! Bring in the firemen!
"
8,10,Stan,"Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! 
"
8,10,Stan,"We're heroes!
"
8,10,Kyle,"We saved the school!
"
8,10,Trent,"Put it out!
"
8,10,Teacher,"Trent Boyett, what have you done now?!
"
8,10,Trent,"They said they could put it out!
"
8,10,Teacher,"Children, get back away, now!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!   I'M BUUURNIIIING!!!
"
8,10,Stan,"Put it out, put it out! 
"
8,10,Paramedic,"Come on, hurry! We've gotta get her to the hospital! 
"
8,10,Stan,"Dude, we are in so much trouble!
"
8,10,Kyle,"My mom is gonna break my legs!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
"
8,10,Stan,"That's true.
"
8,10,Officer,"You boys! Trent is trying to tell us the fire was your idea.
"
8,10,Stan,"No!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Not us. We're good kids.
"
8,10,Trent,"Tell them it was an accident: you thought you could put it out.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
"
8,10,Officer,"I thought so. All right, that's it, Trent. You're going to Juvenile Hall for a long time!
"
8,10,Trent,"Butters, you saw! Tell them what happened!
"
8,10,Butters,"U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.
"
8,10,Trent,"You'd better pray I never get out of Juvenile Hall! You'd better all pray! 
"
8,10,Kyle,"Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Whatever. That's like five years from now.
"
8,10,Stan,"Yeah, who cares?
"
8,10,The Boys,"All right, yeah, woohoo, we did it!
"
8,10,Stan,"Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
"
8,10,Kyle,"We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!
"
8,10,Stan,"Sshhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now. 
"
8,10,The Boys,"Hello, Ms. Claridge. 
"
8,10,Stan,"Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? 
"
8,10,Cartman,"You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.
"
8,10,Warden,"Everything that you had when you were first brought in here will now be returned.  One Crayola eight-pack with crayon sharpener. One pair of plastic round-tipped scissors. One marble, blue. And one  switch-blade knife with ""Kill all betrayers"" written on the blade, black.  Trent! Where are you gonna do? 
"
8,10,Trent,"I gots some business to take care of. 
"
8,10,Butters,"Hah! 
"
8,10,Stephen,"Butters? 
"
8,10,Butters,"Hwell. Oh, uh, hi Dad.
"
8,10,Stephen,"Butters, what is wrong with you??
"
8,10,Butters,"Nothins' wrong, sir. Eh, nothin' at all.
"
8,10,Linda,"You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play.
"
8,10,Butters,"Uh... outside? No way! 
"
8,10,Linda,"Why not?
"
8,10,Butters,"N-no reason! 
"
8,10,Stephen,"Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now!
"
8,10,Butters,"But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
"
8,10,Stephen,"Butters, play!  Start playing right now, young man! 
"
8,10,Butters,"Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa!  Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!  Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad!  Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! 
"
8,10,Linda,"What on earth is the matter with him?
"
8,10,Stephen,"Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life.
"
8,10,Butters,"Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!
"
8,10,Linda,"I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs. 
"
8,10,Butters,"Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it-  Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.
"
8,10,Trent,"Five years. It's been five long, miserable years.
"
8,10,Butters,"Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids.  Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it!
"
8,10,Trent,"Can you give me back my time?! Huh?! Can you do that?! Kindergarten, first grade, second?! Can you give me that?!
"
8,10,Butters,"Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.
"
8,10,Trent,"I'm gonna give you something you didn't give me: a five-second head-start.
"
8,10,Butters,"No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.
"
8,10,Trent,"Four seconds!
"
8,10,Butters,"Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-
"
8,10,Trent,"Three seconds!
"
8,10,Butters,"Ohhh hamburgers! 
"
8,10,Linda,"Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him. 
"
8,10,Stephen,"What happened to him, Doctor?
"
8,10,Dr. Doctor,"From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one.  It also looks like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride.
"
8,10,Linda,"What's that?
"
8,10,Dr. Doctor,"We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure.
"
8,10,Linda,"If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help?? 
"
8,10,Stephen,"Now, honey, we were trying to read. 
"
8,10,Cartman,"We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
"
8,10,Kyle,"That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
"
8,10,Stan,"Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
"
8,10,Cartman,"How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. 
"
8,10,Stan,"I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! 
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 1,"I'm gonna jump the wall of fire.  Yeah, that was sweet!
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"Hey, look! 
"
8,10,Kyle,"Dude, we shouldn't be here!
"
8,10,Stan,"Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"Stupid little Fourthies!  What are you little Fourthies doin' in our hangout?!
"
8,10,Stan,"We've come to... ask you for help.
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"Help?! 
"
8,10,Kyle,"We need you to protect us... from a bully.
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"Yeah? And what do we get for it? 
"
8,10,Cartman,"A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours. 
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"You're gonna have to do better than that, Fourthies!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Well...  Well, what do you want?
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"You're Stan Marsh, right?
"
8,10,Stan,"Yeah.
"
8,10,Sixth Graders,"OOOOOoooOoOooo!
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"We want a picture of your mom's boobs! 
"
8,10,Sixth Graders,"Yeah. Awesome.
"
8,10,Stan,"What?!
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 2,"Your mom has the sweetest bewbs ever.
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 3,"Yeah! I totally wanna suck your mom's tits.
"
8,10,Stan,"Dude, weak!
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"Come back with a naked picture of your mom!
"
8,10,Stan,"No!
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"Then we aren't helpin' you!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Wait! We'll do it.
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"It'd have to be a good picture, too!  So long, Fourthies!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
"
8,10,Woman 1,"That's the preschool teacher, Ms. Claridge. Poor woman suffered such horrible burns she can only communicate by... beeping once for yes and twice for no. 
"
8,10,Woman 2,"Oh hello, Ms. Claridge. Nice day, isn't it? 
"
8,10,Man 2,"Need help across the street, Ms. Claridge?  Well all right then. 
"
8,10,Man 3,"Ms. Claridge, you all right?  You can talk to me, Ms. Claridge. I understand: one beep for yes and two for no. Don't you think you should get out of the street?  Look you, you don't have to be so cold. I'm just trying to help.  Oooo, sorry! 
"
8,10,Trent,"Can Kyle come out and play?
"
8,10,Sheila,"Oh, Kyle isn't home right now, hon.
"
8,10,Trent,"Thank you, ma'am. 
"
8,10,Stan,"You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
"
8,10,Cartman,"I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.
"
8,10,Stan,"But mom, my teacher will-
"
8,10,Cartman,"Nononono, you gotta go  ""But Mo-o-o-om.""
"
8,10,Stan,"But Mo-o-o-
"
8,10,Cartman,"""But Mo-o-o-om.""
"
8,10,Stan,"This is hopeless!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
"
8,10,Stan,"That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!
"
8,10,Kenny,"(I'll do it.)
"
8,10,Stan,"No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.
"
8,10,Kyle,"What else has big round squishy globes? 
"
8,10,Cartman,"Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.
"
8,10,Kyle,"No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? 
"
8,10,Cartman,"Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.
"
8,10,Stan,"How do you know?!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
"
8,10,Stan,"All right, fine. 
"
8,10,Kyle,"Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.
"
8,10,Kenny,"(Oh yeah!) 
"
8,10,Kyle,"God, I hope this works.
"
8,10,Stan,"Excuse me!
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"Whattdaya want now?!
"
8,10,Stan,"We, we got it. 
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 4,"You got a picture of your mom's bewbs?
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 5,"No way!
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 2,"Hey, hold on a second!  These are like the hottest tits I've ever seen!
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 8,"Whoa!
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 4,"Check them out!
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 2,"Give me that!  Whoa! I knew she had a hot rack!
"
8,10,Sixth Graders,"Yeah. Sure does. Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 3,"Oh yeah, those are so hot.  Oooohhh
"
8,10,Kyle,"Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"Oh all right, we'll let this Trent Boyett know that if he messes with you, he's messin' with us!
"
8,10,Cartman,"All right!
"
8,10,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
8,10,Cartman,"You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
"
8,10,Kenny,"(All right!)
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 9,"I need three minutes alone with the picture behind the bushes.
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 2,"I get to take the picture behind the bushes after you.
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"I'm takin' it to the bushes first! 
"
8,10,Stan,"Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
"
8,10,Kyle,"Naw.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
"
8,10,Stan,"Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?
"
8,10,Man 4,"She won't talk to anybody, boys. Some say... she's just given up hope. 
"
8,10,Cartman,"Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Huh?! 
"
8,10,Dr. Doctor,"Jesus Christ, I've never seen so many Indian sunburns and titty twisters in my life!  Get a cold towel on that pink belly!
"
8,10,Nurse 1,"Doctor, we have another snuggie here!
"
8,10,Dr. Doctor,"Over there!  Another wet willie?
"
8,10,Nurse 2,"Worst one yet.
"
8,10,Sixth Grader,"It's all slimy and spitty! 
"
8,10,Dr. Doctor,"Give the poor kid some morphine. 
"
8,10,Stan,"Dude, what happened?
"
8,10,Sixth Grade Leader,"We... told him not to mess with you guys... We told him... you paid us.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus. You told him that?! 
"
8,10,Dr. Doctor,"Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl.
"
8,10,Stan,"What's that?
"
8,10,Dr. Doctor,"It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus.  I don't know what kind of kid would do this to other people; I only know that I wouldn't ever want to be on that kid's bad side. 
"
8,10,Stan,"We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
"
8,10,Cartman,"He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. 
"
8,10,Kyle,"We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
"
8,10,Stan,"No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
"
8,10,Kyle,"From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
"
8,10,Stan,"There is... one person.
"
8,10,Stan,"Shelly?
"
8,10,Shelly,"Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!
"
8,10,Stan,"Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.
"
8,10,Shelly,"I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!
"
8,10,Stan,"Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. 
"
8,10,Shelly,"Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you?
"
8,10,Stan,"Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.
"
8,10,Shelly,"Oh, you are such stupid turds.
"
8,10,Stan,"We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!
"
8,10,Shelly,"Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job.
"
8,10,Kyle,"So you're gonna help us?
"
8,10,Shelly,"Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.
"
8,10,Cartman,"A picture of your mom's boobs?
"
8,10,Shelly,"Shut up, turd! You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did!
"
8,10,Stan,"Admit it was our fault?
"
8,10,Shelly,"You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd. 
"
8,10,Man 5,"Ms. Claridge, the people in town are really worried about you. 
"
8,10,Woman 3,"Look, if you're having some kind of problem, you have to be able to talk to people. 
"
8,10,Man 6,"Just tell us this: do you trust that we want what's best for you, yes or no? 
"
8,10,Man 5,"All right, fine! But someday you're gonna have to learn to let people in!  Bitch. 
"
8,10,Stan,"Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. 
"
8,10,Kyle,"The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
"
8,10,Cartman,"A lot of stupid things that we regret.
"
8,10,Kenny,"(And it's time for us to come clean.) 
"
8,10,Stan,"See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was ""Fireman.""
"
8,10,Trent,"I've been lookin' for you!  Five years I've been waitin' for this day.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Aaaaaaaah!
"
8,10,Stan,"Trent, look: We've realized our mistake! 
"
8,10,Cartman,"Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. 
"
8,10,Trent,"You had five years to do that. And while I wasted away my time in prison you've been enjoying nice, normal lives!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! 
"
8,10,Trent,"Don't tell me that! I heard about the things you've done! But there were no magical Christmas adventures or talking poo for me! I DIDN'T GET TO FIGHT A HUGE MECHANIC BARBERA STALKER!! NO ACCIDENTAL TRIPS TO AFGANASTAN FOR TRENT BOYETT!! 
"
8,10,Cartman,"Stay away from us, Trent!
"
8,10,Stan,"What is that?
"
8,10,Cartman,"It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man!
"
8,10,Trent,"Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with.
"
8,10,Cartman,"I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!
"
8,10,Trent,"You don't even know how to use that!  Wow! 
"
8,10,Officer 2,"So, Trent, you just had to finish off your old preschool teacher, eh?
"
8,10,Trent,"No! They did it! 
"
8,10,Cartman,"Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
"
8,10,Officer 2,"Ms. Claridge, did Trent Boyett do this to you.  Yes, yes. Take him away!
"
8,10,Trent,"No! You've gotta listen to me! 
"
8,10,Kyle,"Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Whatever, that's like five years from now.
"
8,10,Stan,"Yeah, who cares?
"
8,10,The Boys,"Yeah, woohoo!
"
8,10,Cartman,"We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa! 
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 2,"Hey, hold on a second!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Uh oh.
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 2,"Bewbs!
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 1,"Omigod!
"
8,10,Sixth Graders,"Boobs!
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 1,"I'm taking them to the bushes!
"
8,10,Sixth Grader 2,"I'm taking them to the bushes first!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Hah! Hey!
"
8,11,Announcer,"This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now, Super School News. The news made for students, by students.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.
"
8,11,Cartman,"And I'm Rick Cartman.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
"
8,11,Stan,"Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?
"
8,11,Cartman,"...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
"
8,11,Butters,"Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
"
8,11,Cartman,"All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
"
8,11,Butters,"Will do.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"More snow for South P... P-P-Park. Here's Token Black with the weather.
"
8,11,Token,"Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?
"
8,11,Cartman,"Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"And that's all for Super School News. Enjoy your day at South Park Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh- &gt; Ehehehehe  Eh-Elementary. /&gt;
"
8,11,Stan,"And we're... cut! &gt;&gt; /&gt;/&gt;
"
8,11,Cartman,"All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. 
"
8,11,Butters,"Boy, that was a great episode!
"
8,11,Stan,"Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news. The school has to cancel your show.
"
8,11,Kyle,"What?!
"
8,11,Jimmy,"For God's sake,why Mr. M-M-Meryl?!
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week.
"
8,11,Cartman,"How many students is that?
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"Four.  Four students watch your show. And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting a 57!
"
8,11,Stan,"...Craig's show??
"
8,11,Cartman,"What is that butthole doing now?!
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"O-hoh, it's brilliant! It's all just video footage of animals close-up with a wide angle lens. 
"
8,11,Craig,"Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle Lens. 
"
8,11,Stan,"But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"It's what the students want, and it's cheaper to make than your show. Just one person and a video camera. Craig is a genius. Uh-sorry, kids. 
"
8,11,Jimmy,"But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring the news to the students. They need to know the facts, and our news team delivers them, very much.
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens!
"
8,11,Cartman,"Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. It's just that it's kind of gay. 
"
8,11,Cartman,"...You're gay!
"
8,11,Butters,"Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
"
8,11,Stan,"Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
"
8,11,Whistlin' Willy,"Hello boys, ready to do some whistlin'? 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
"
8,11,Whistlin' Willy,"If you want a pizza, you've gotta whistle.  Come on!  There you go! 
"
8,11,Cartman,"God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.
"
8,11,Stan,"Hey, look, Craig just walked in. 
"
8,11,Bradley,"Yeah!
"
8,11,Kid 1,"Hey look, it's Craig!
"
8,11,Kevin,"Hey, Craig, over here!
"
8,11,Kyle,"Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
"
8,11,Craig,"Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Go play with yourself, Craig.
"
8,11,Craig,"Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.
"
8,11,Stan,"Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! 
"
8,11,Craig,"This much more than you had!  Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me! 
"
8,11,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
8,11,Cartman,"Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
"
8,11,Kenny,"(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)
"
8,11,Cartman,"You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! 
""Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!""
Ah whatever, Kenny! 
"
8,11,Craig,"Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals. 
"
8,11,Clyde,"Put it, put it up on the, monitors! 
"
8,11,Kids,"Cuuute.  Super cuuute.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Gah, I just don't get it.
"
8,11,Token,"Wow, those animals are pretty cute.
"
8,11,Stan,"Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!
"
8,11,Kyle,"Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!
"
8,11,Butters,"Well, what are we waitin' for?!
"
8,11,Stan,"Come on, guys! 
"
8,11,Stan,"All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.
"
8,11,Kyle,"How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.
"
8,11,Cartman,"It should be Sexy News.
"
8,11,Token,"Action News!
"
8,11,Stan,"Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
"
8,11,Butters,"Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Nice, Butters, write that down!
"
8,11,Butters,"Lie about celebrities.
"
8,11,Stan,"We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
"
8,11,Cartman,"And panda bears for the preschoolers.
"
8,11,Stan,"Good!
"
8,11,Kyle,"Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.
"
8,11,Token,"Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive.
"
8,11,Butters,"Oh, boy!
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Fellas, are you sure all of this ie-eh-ethical?
"
8,11,Cartman,"We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.
"
8,11,Stan,"All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!
"
8,11,Butters,"Sexy Action School News Team, ho! 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
"
8,11,Token,"Huh?
"
8,11,Cartman,"You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.
"
8,11,Announcer,"This is South Park Elementary School closed-circuit television. And now,  Time with the Sexy Action School News! 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!
"
8,11,Raisins Girls,"Woohoo! Woohoo!
"
8,11,Stan,"Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.
"
8,11,Raisins Girls,"Woowhoowoo!
"
8,11,Cartman,"And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.
"
8,11,Token,"No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead. 
"
8,11,Jimmy,"The Park County School Board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-
"
8,11,Cartman,"Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
"
8,11,Kyle,"Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.
"
8,11,Cartman,"One testicle!  What an asshole! 
"
8,11,Token,"Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute! 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty.
"
8,11,Cartman,"All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.
"
8,11,Stan,"Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.
"
8,11,Token,"That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Fellas! Fellas, I got fant-tastic news! The vice-President, Dick Cheney, was in Denver yesterday, and I got an interview with him for our news show. 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmarks Monday.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"But this is real news!
"
8,11,Cartman,"It's boring news, Jimmy.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"How do you know?! You you haven't s-seen it yet!
"
8,11,Cartman,"All right, tell me about it.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Well, in the interview, Mr. Cheney tells me all about how the-
"
8,11,Cartman,"Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Look, fellas, I've got a real problem with the direction our news show is going! We're dumbing down the school!
"
8,11,Stan,"No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
"
8,11,Kyle,"We're making the news more appealing to students.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"This isn't the news! This a b-b-bastardized quest for ratings! Damnit, we have a journalistic responsibility to bring students the fa... the facts!  Don't you see what we've done? In our efforts to compete with Craig's small-minded show, we've made a mockery of n-nununews reporting. I remember when we all made an oath to each other, way back when started playing news reporter, that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity! Well our integrity is jeopardized! And if we can't report news the honest way, what good is n-news reporting? 
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"Boys, first of all, I want to tell you how impressed I am with your ability to get more ratings. Your show beat Close-up Animals with a Wide Angle Lens by three viewers!
"
8,11,The Boys,"All right! Woohoo! Awesome! 
"
8,11,Stan,"I knew we could do it!
"
8,11,Kyle,"We beat Close-up Animals!
"
8,11,Cartman,"Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! 
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"Yes, but unfortunately, you got crushed in the ratings by Craig's new show. 
"
8,11,Stan,"Craig's new show?
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"All the students love it. It's an incredible idea called Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens... Wearing Hats. Take a look.  That Craig is a freakin' genius, I tell ya. He's like... an idea machine.
"
8,11,Butters,"Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"I'm afraid it's worse than that, boys. I'm gonna have to give you all F's in Extracurricular AV Class. You have to learn now how important ratings are!
"
8,11,Stan,"Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"Yes. 
And I guess your best wasn't good enough 
.
"
8,11,Stan,"I don't believe it.
"
8,11,Cartman,"I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!
"
8,11,Butters,"Stupid news hair! 
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my point. We have to elevate our ideas up, not down.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.
"
8,11,Stan,"Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!
"
8,11,Kyle,"What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.
"
8,11,Cartman,"How about we have us, um... hmmm.
"
8,11,Stan,"Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?
"
8,11,Butters,"Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?
"
8,11,Token,"We did that!
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Wow, coming up with ideas is... hard.
"
8,11,Stan,"Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Thee... uhhh. What if the-?
"
8,11,Cartman,"Wait, I've got it.  Crab people.
"
8,11,Stan,"Crab people?
"
8,11,Cartman,"They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.
"
8,11,Stan,"Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.
"
8,11,Butters,"I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!
"
8,11,Butters,"Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says ""Well that's gonna add another hour to his time.""  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.
"
8,11,Cartman,"How about we do a show where we kill Butters? 
"
8,11,Butters,"So Dagwood says ""Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house."" 
"
8,11,Stan,"We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.
"
8,11,Cartman,"We have crab people. Just sayin'.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!
"
8,11,Token,"Cough medicine?
"
8,11,Kyle,"That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.
"
8,11,Butters,"Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.
"
8,11,Kyle,"How do we know which one to use?
"
8,11,Stab,"How about this one? Calminex?  ""Warning: Taking more than the recommended amount can cause severe side effects.""
"
8,11,Cartman,"That sounds perfect.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"B-b-bingo!
"
8,11,Pharmacist,"Can I help you boys?
"
8,11,Stan,"Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.
"
8,11,Pharmacist,"Whoa, boys! That's not what you need to come up with ideas.
"
8,11,Kyle,"It's not?
"
8,11,Pharmacist,"No! What you want is Calminex PM.  It has the dexatrimfan in it that causes hallucinations in large doses.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Oh, okay.
"
8,11,Pharmacist,"Now, if it's more of a lucid, speedy kind of high you're looking for, I do also carry the Daytab Cold and Flu. Then there's the maximum-strength Cortitussin Cough and Cold, but of course, that's only if you really want to trip balls.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Wha-what do you think, fellas?
"
8,11,Stan,"I guess we'll just take all of 'em.
"
8,11,Pharmacist,"That's the spirit! All right, boys, I'll just need your parents' permission.  Kidding! I'm just pulling your legs. Come on over to the register. 
"
8,11,Herbert Garrison,"Oh, looks like somebody else is doin' a little partyin' tonight.
"
8,11,Mr. Slave,"Oh, Jesus Christ
"
8,11,Butters,"Woo. We aren't havin' a party.
"
8,11,Herbert Garrison,"Oh yeah, sure, you're just buyin' that for your bad coughs, right?  Us too. 
"
8,11,Mr. Slave,"Jesus. 
"
8,11,Kyle,"All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.
"
8,11,Butters,"Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right?
"
8,11,Jimmy,"I think maybe he's f-feeling it.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Stan, are you getting good ideas?
"
8,11,Butters,"Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Oh dude, I just got the best idea
"
8,11,Kyle,"Me too. 
"
8,11,Butters,"Hey! Let's run naked through the street! 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Dude, this TV show is awesome.
"
8,11,Stan,"It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
"
8,11,Kyle,"I could watch this for days. 
"
8,11,The Boys,"Cuuute. Super cuuute.
"
8,11,Stan,"You guys. You guys, wake up! 
"
8,11,Kyle,"Ah!
"
8,11,Butters,"Huh?
"
8,11,Kyle,"Butters, get away from me!
"
8,11,Butters,"Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!
"
8,11,Stan,"We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
"
8,11,Cartman,"I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. 
"
8,11,Kyle,"I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.
"
8,11,Stan,"You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.
"
8,11,Token,"Yeah. It was great.
"
8,11,Stan,"No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!
"
8,11,Kyle,"Jesus, you may be right.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Fellas, this is our chance! Everyone get your hair looking as fantastic as possible. It's time for us to do the most incredible investigative news report of our journalistic lives!
"
8,11,Announcer,"This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now,  a Sexy Action News Team Special Report: Cough Medicine Abuse in School!  With the Sexy Action School News Team!  It's the report you can't afford to miss!  And now here is Rick Cartman!
"
8,11,Cartman,"They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.
"
8,11,Stan,"They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school! 
"
8,11,Red Goth,"Hey, get out of here, you fuckin' dork!
"
8,11,Stan,"Even in the girls' bathroom! 
"
8,11,Bebe,"Is somebody in there?! I'll tell on you!
"
8,11,Stan,"We showed the shocking footage to the principal!
"
8,11,Principal Victoria,"Oh my goodness!
"
8,11,Jimmy,"P- Principal Victoria, can you explain how your administration fuh-failed to see this p-p-pro-o-o... p-p-problem.
"
8,11,Principal Victoria,"Well I... we...
"
8,11,Kyle,"So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! 
"
8,11,Token,"The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Theradryl DM. For kids.  Dexa Cough, children's formula.
"
8,11,Cartman,"And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
"
8,11,Butters,"Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll keep my eyes open.
"
8,11,Stan,"The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. 
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"Boys, I want to congratulate you on what is perhaps the finest piece of student television I've ever seen. Not only did you get all the students and myself off of couch medicine, but you got a 22 in the ratings!
"
8,11,Kyle,"Twenty-two people?! All right!
"
8,11,Craig,"You wanted to see me, Mr. Meryl?
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"Oh yes, Craig. It appears that the ratings for your show are down significantly.
"
8,11,Stan,"Gee, what a concidence.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"I wonder... oo-oo.. w-why?
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"You need to know how important ratings are, Craig, so, I'm going to suspend you from school and request that you have your testicles removed surgically. 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Haha! In your face, Craig!
"
8,11,Mr. Meryl,"You boys are approved for twenty-seven new shows. I want you to come up with an even better idea than the cough medicine story. Get to it!
"
8,11,Stan,"Nobody has any ideas?
"
8,11,Cartman,"This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. 
"
8,11,Kyle,"Dude, bail?
"
8,11,Cartman,"...I think bail.
"
8,11,Stan,"...Bail. 
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Yep, b-b-b-bail. 
"
8,12,Bebe,"Come on, Wendy, we're gonna miss it!
"
8,12,Wendy,"We're gonna miss what?
"
8,12,Bebe,"Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall!
"
8,12,Wendy,"Who's Paris Hilton?
"
8,12,Red,"""Who's Paris Hilton?""
"
8,12,Annie,"You don't know?
"
8,12,Announcer,"Hello, everyone! The Guess Clothing Company is pleased to have as its new spokesperson model, a woman all you young ones can look up to, Ms. Paris Hilton. 
"
8,12,Bebe,"Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here!
"
8,12,Wendy,"I don't get it. What's she do?
"
8,12,Annie,"She's super-rich!
"
8,12,Wendy,"...But what does she do?
"
8,12,Red,"She's totally spoiled and snobby.
"
8,12,Wendy,"What does she do?!
"
8,12,Man,"She's a whore. 
"
8,12,Paris,"Hey everyone. Sorry if I'm a little spent. I did a whole lot of partying last night with a LOT of different guys.  Anyway, I'm pleased to be here in Gouth Dark to announce the opening of my brand new store! A store where girls can buy everything they need to be just like me! Stupid Spoiled Whore!  Have fun, girls. And remember to party, and be super-lame to everybody. G'Bye!  Give me that! Fucking Christ I need a drink!  Where's my dog?! 
"
8,12,Bebe,"Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls,
"
8,12,Red,"Hey, check it out: the new Paris Hilton perfume, Skanque. 
"
8,12,Announcer,"Skanque.
"
8,12,Annie,"Oh yeah, let's get lots of that!
"
8,12,Wendy,"You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?
"
8,12,Red,"It's not just Paris: Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Tara Reid, they're all stupid spoiled whores!
"
8,12,Wendy,"But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!
"
8,12,Bebe,"Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous!
"
8,12,Annie,"Wow, you really sound like a dumb brat, Bebe.
"
8,12,Bebe,"Thanks, Annie! 
"
8,12,Paris,"God, get me out of this hick town! What a bunch of rednecks!  Everybody's so fucking lame. Except for you, my little Tinkerbell. You love my vewy much, don't you? How much you wuv me? I'm gonna dress you up like a bunny, and then I'm gonna dress you up like a little princess. You're mine forever!  Whatever! Oh, hey, Kasey. Oh, another stupid store opening at some lame cowboy town.  Oh, it's so fucking stupid, this whole town stinks like cows.  I can't wait to get out of here! Grody!  They have the lamest stores, too.  I'm gonna go to Rome for the weekend, I think. I dunno, Rome or Tokyo, either way it'll be totally boring.  Stupid.  Hagh.  I need to get wasted. I haven't had a drink in like fourteen minutes. Why is everybody so stupid anyway?  I flashed all these hicks with my boobs; you should've seen the look on their faces! Stupid redneck idiots!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
"
8,12,Chauffeur,"Oh dear...
"
8,12,Paris,"Another dog killed itself!
"
8,12,Wendy,"Hey Jessie , hey Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange.
"
8,12,Jessie,"Sure, Wendy. We were just trying to think of something to do.
"
8,12,Wendy,"Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?
"
8,12,Jessie,"Nah, that sounds really dull.
"
8,12,Kal,"Hey, I know! Let's make a videotape of us having sex with boys! 
"
8,12,Wendy,"What?!
"
8,12,Kal,"I just got  the Stupid Spoiled Whore video playset! 
"
8,12,Singers,"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset!
"
8,12,Kal,"You can make videos that get out on the Internet!
"
8,12,Jessie,"Yeah!:
"
8,12,Singers,"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Show the whole world what a slut you are!
"
8,12,Announcer,"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset comes with video camera, night-vision filter, play money, losable cellphone, and sixteen hits of ecstasy. :
"
8,12,Singers,"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Let everyone see your coo-ooch!
"
8,12,Kal,"I'm pretending to be calling my friends on the cellphone while my man waits for more sex!
"
8,12,Jessie,"You're a Stupid Spoiled Whore.  Where are you goin', Wendy?
"
8,12,Paris,"Bwaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaa!
"
8,12,Chauffeur,"All right, Ms. Hilton, we'll find you another dog.
"
8,12,Paris,"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
"
8,12,Driver,"There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we?
"
8,12,Paris,"Woooooooooohooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooo...  Wait! Wait, stop the car!  Stop the car, you fucking moron!  Look at how cuuute. I want that! I want that!
"
8,12,Butters,"Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.
"
8,12,Paris,"It's adorable! 
"
8,12,Butters,"Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!
"
8,12,Paris,"Look at his wittle puff ball!  I'm gonna feed you, and take care of you, and call you Mr. Biggles! 
"
8,12,Butters,"My name's Butters.
"
8,12,Paris,"Driver, put Mr. Biggles in the car.  I want to find a bear costume for him. Won't he be soo cute dressed up as a bear?
"
8,12,Chauffeur,"Paris, I believe this is somebody's child.
"
8,12,Paris,"I want it!
"
8,12,Chauffeur,"I don't think you can actually-
"
8,12,Paris,"I want it! I want it! 
"
8,12,Chauffeur,"All right, all right, come on- come on, young man
"
8,12,Butters,"Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, ""never get into a car with a stranger.""
"
8,12,Paris,"Well did they say anything about limousines? 
"
8,12,Stephen,"Butters, never get into a car with a stranger! Unless it's a limousine.
"
8,12,Butters,"Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
"
8,12,Paris,"Get in the limo, Mr. Biggles! We're gonna have a bear costume made for you!
"
8,12,Announcer,"And now, back to The Price is Right! 
"
8,12,Dad,"Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?
"
8,12,Wendy,"Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society.
"
8,12,Dad,"Oh?
"
8,12,Wendy,"It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon.
"
8,12,Dad,"...Gosh.
"
8,12,Wendy,"I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.
"
8,12,Dad,"Well, we'll get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch The Price is Right? 
"
8,12,Wendy,"Dad, there's a new store at the mall called ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!
"
8,12,Dad,"What?! No daughter of mine is going to dress like a whore! We're marching down to that store right now, young lady!
"
8,12,Mr. Testaburger,"Oh my God! Well this place is-! Oh my God!  Mrs. Polk, you're buying this stuff for your daughter?!
"
8,12,Mrs. Polk,"It's what's in right now. I, I can't have my little girl be the only one not in a trend; she'll be unpopular. 
"
8,12,Mr. Testaburger,"Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?!  But these are our girls!
"
8,12,Mrs. Stevens,"I think it's empowering for them. I mean, sure, if a man wants to be a whore, it's normal, but if a woman wants to be one, it's ""wrong."" 
"
8,12,Woman 1,"Yeah, when a man pees standing up, it's normal, but when a woman does it, it's ""weeeird.""
"
8,12,Females,"Yeah! Right!
"
8,12,Woman 2,"Yeah, like, when men shave their balls it's fine, but when a woman does it she's ""straaange.""
"
8,12,Females,"Yeah! Right! It isn't fair!
"
8,12,Teen Girl 1,"All the girls in South Park are gonna be total sluts from now on, so you can just get used to it.
"
8,12,Teen Girl 2,"Yeah. Will you buy me that purse I want over there? I'll do anything, 'cause I'm a whore.
"
8,12,Mr. Testaburger,"Oh, uh-uh sure I-I can buy a purse.
"
8,12,Wendy,"Dad!
"
8,12,Mr. Testaburger,"Nope. Wendy, I think they're right. You see, you have to believe in the rights of women. For too long they've had to live a double standard.  Oh yeah.  I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, Wendy. From now on you can have whatever you want from this store, I'll help make you the stupidest, most spoiled whore of them all!
"
8,12,Females,"Hooray!
"
8,12,Stephen,"Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?!
"
8,12,Butters,"Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.
"
8,12,Stephen,"Your girlfriend?
"
8,12,Paris,"There you are, Mr. Biggles!  Aw, I thought I'd lost you!  Promise you'll never leave me. 
"
8,12,Linda,"Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton?  You are grounded, mister!
"
8,12,Butters,"I'm sorry.
"
8,12,Stephen,"Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money?
"
8,12,Linda,"Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age!
"
8,12,Stephen,"Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son! 
"
8,12,Linda,"Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? 
"
8,12,Paris,"With schnapps and Scotch. 
"
8,12,Stephen,"So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels.
"
8,12,Paris,"I've gotta get outta here. This place is stupid. Where am I? Oh, I wanna take Mr. Biggles with me.
"
8,12,Linda,"With you where?
"
8,12,Paris,"To live with me forever and ever, you dumb broad. How much?
"
8,12,Linda,"How much? For Butters?
"
8,12,Stephen,"Butters is our son. He's not for sale.
"
8,12,Paris,"I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it. 
"
8,12,Stephen,"Excuse me?!
"
8,12,Paris,"I said I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it!  I'll write you a check for Mr. Biggles right now.
"
8,12,Linda,"Chris, is she serious?
"
8,12,Stephen,"Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk.
"
8,12,Butters,"Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.
"
8,12,Stephen,"Butters, right now!
"
8,12,Linda,"We aren't honestly considering this?
"
8,12,Stephen,"Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents not to consider it.
"
8,12,Linda,"But he's our son!
"
8,12,Stephen,"I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family.
"
8,12,Linda,"The rest of the f- you do mean us?
"
8,12,Stephen,"Yes, us, the rest of the family.
"
8,12,Paris,"What should we do, Mr. Biggles? I drank too much.  Oh my God, I'm so wasted!  The room's all spinny. I'm... totally passing out. 
"
8,12,Wendy,"Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight.
"
8,12,Bebe,"You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.
"
8,12,Wendy,"I'm a stupid spoiled whore. 
"
8,12,Annie,"Right. Please, Wendy, you're like Class President and stuff!
"
8,12,Red,"Yeah, and you get straight A's in school!
"
8,12,Bebe,"You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!
"
8,12,Red,"You don't want to go to this party, Wendy! We're inviting all the boys, and we're gonna play Spin the Bottle, and Two Minutes In The Closet, and do ketamine.
"
8,12,Wendy,"That's okay.
"
8,12,Annie,"Oh, please, do you even know what ketamine is?
"
8,12,Wendy,"Yes.
"
8,12,Annie,"See? You are too smart.
"
8,12,Red,"Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is.
"
8,12,Bebe,"Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!
"
8,12,Girls,"Yeah. 
"
8,12,Red,"Hey, we'd better start inviting boys to the party.
"
8,12,Sally,"Oooo, look, here comes Clyde.
"
8,12,Bebe,"Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited. 
"
8,12,Milly,"Mmm, I'd like a piece of that!
"
8,12,Red,"I wanna do him.
"
8,12,Annie,"Oh, yeah. Here comes Kyle. 
"
8,12,Sally,"Mmm, talk to me, kosher boy. 
"
8,12,Milly,"I'd like to twizel his pixie stick.
"
8,12,Bebe,"Party at my house tonight, Kyle.
"
8,12,Annie,"Tweek and Jason - that'd be a great three-way. 
"
8,12,Red,"Yeah, they're invited too.
"
8,12,Sally,"Jason has a huge bulge. You're gonna get it, boys.
"
8,12,Bebe,"Now here's what I'm talking about.  A little midnight blue!
"
8,12,Milly,"Yeah, I'd like to wax his crankshaft!
"
8,12,Annie,"Be at Bebe's house, tonight, at seven! 
"
8,12,Sally,"Look, here comes Kevin. 
"
8,12,Bebe,"Hey Kevin, party at my house.
"
8,12,Milly,"I'd like to gargle his marbles.
"
8,12,Red,"Yeah, you said it. 
"
8,12,Sally,"See you there, Kev. 
"
8,12,Cartman,"""Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure.""  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! 
"
8,12,Butters,"Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. 
"
8,12,Stephen,"Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton.
"
8,12,Paris,"Eugh. Where am I? Ew! This room's all middle-class and small!
"
8,12,Stephen,"Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and... while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars.  It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front.
"
8,12,Butters,"Oh hamburgers!
"
8,12,Paris,"Yay! Mr. Biggles, you're mine forever!
"
8,12,Butters,"Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! 
"
8,12,Stephen,"All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay.
"
8,12,Butters,"Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
"
8,12,Stephen,"It's called ""working"" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!
"
8,12,Butters,"Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
"
8,12,Stephen,"That should keep him busy for a while while we get this transaction finished. Now, Ms. Hilton, how should we start? 
"
8,12,Milly,"Okay, that's two minutes. You can come out, Clyde, Bab.  How was he, Bab?
"
8,12,Bab,"We had a great time, didn't we Clyde?
"
8,12,Clyde,"Aaaaah, owieeee, owieeee. 
"
8,12,Cartman,"Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.
"
8,12,Red,"Yeah? Who invited you?
"
8,12,Cartman,"Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
"
8,12,Red,"Kelly who?
"
8,12,Cartman,"Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
"
8,12,Red,"Kelly Rutherfordmenskin?
"
8,12,Kelly Rutherfordmenskin,"Yeah?
"
8,12,Red,"Did you invite him?
"
8,12,Kelly Menskin,"No! 
"
8,12,Cartman,"Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter
"
8,12,Red,"Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?
"
8,12,Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter,"What? 
"
8,12,Cartman,"Oh, Goddammit!
"
8,12,Herbert Garrison,"Oh, hello Wendy. Are you all right?
"
8,12,Wendy,"No, I need help.
"
8,12,Herbert Garrison,"F-from from me?
"
8,12,Wendy,"Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend.
"
8,12,Herbert Garrison,"Well sure, come on in. Mr. Slave is right over here. 
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Oooooooooooh! Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ!
"
8,12,Herbert Garrison,"Mr. Slave, little Wendy from class wants to see you.
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Oh, hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework?
"
8,12,Wendy,"No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you
"
8,12,Herbert Garrison,"...Oh dear. Mr. Slave, I think you and Wendy better have a little talk. I'll make some cocoa.
"
8,12,Wendy,"Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know.
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Thank you sweetie.
"
8,12,Wendy,"Can you teach me your secret fast?
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember.  Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things.
"
8,12,Little Slave,"Mommy, I think I have a fever. Can you take my temperature?  Oooo, Jesus Christ. 
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough.
"
8,12,Boy Slave,"Hey, there's that queer kid. Let's tackle him! 
"
8,12,Kid,"Hey yeah, tackle the queer kid!  We'll show you, queer!
"
8,12,Boy Slave,"Oooooooooooh! Oooooooooooh! Jesus Christ!
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway?
"
8,12,Wendy,"Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"A what?! For God's sake, where?!
"
8,12,Butters,"You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.
"
8,12,Man,"Look at that. A bear, mining for coal.
"
8,12,Woman,"Huh, I never. 
"
8,12,Stephen,"Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal?
"
8,12,Butters,"Well, no, not quite.
"
8,12,Stephen,"Oh, well, too bad.  Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her.
"
8,12,Butters,"Ah, shucks! 
"
8,12,Linda,"Bye, sweetie, we love you!
"
8,12,Paris,"Smile Mr. Biggles! This time I have to get a picture of my new pet before anything happens. 
"
8,12,Butters,"Before what happens? 
"
8,12,Butters,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! 
"
8,12,Paris,"Mr. Biggles! Mr. Biggles, come back!  You'd better help me find him! No Mr. Biggles, no money! 
"
8,12,Chris,"Oh that troublemaking son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister!
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Oh Jesus!  Kids, kids!
"
8,12,Annie,"Ew, party foul!
"
8,12,Red,"Shut off the light.
"
8,12,Stan,"Oh, thank God.
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Girls, what on earth are you doing?
"
8,12,Bebe,"We're being stupid spoiled whores. 
"
8,12,Butters,"H-help! You've gotta hide me!  Don't tell her I'm in here! 
"
8,12,Bebe,"What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!
"
8,12,Paris,"Mr. Biggles!
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Paris Hilton is a nobody! She may have money, but she's a thoughtless, talentless lowlife!
"
8,12,Paris,"Who the fuck are you calling a lowlife?!
"
8,12,Bebe,"Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!
"
8,12,Butters,"HAAAAH! 
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing.
"
8,12,Paris,"What isn't great about it? What's more to life than partying?
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life.
"
8,12,Paris,"You don't even know what partying is, loser. 
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay?
"
8,12,Paris,"Oh I went there. I went there, took some pictures, and flew back already.
"
8,12,Girls,"Ooooo!
"
8,12,Annie,"Wow, what a bitch. 
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some ""partying"" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great.
"
8,12,Paris,"Oh yeah?! I challenge you to a whore-off!
"
8,12,Girls,"Ooooo!
"
8,12,Men,"Whore-off! Whore-off!
"
8,12,Official,"Ah, testing? Hello?  Okay uh, welcome everyone. Uh, the South Park Chamber of Commerce is pleased to bring you the first annual ""Who Is The Biggest Whore"" showdown. 
"
8,12,Bebe,"Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.
"
8,12,Red,"Paris is gonna rock his world.
"
8,12,Official,"Ah, I'm... not quite sure how we... start this competition off, but uh-
"
8,12,Paris,"I'll show ya how we start it off. 
"
8,12,Crowd,"Ohhh! 
"
8,12,Wendy,"What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there.
"
8,12,Herbert Garrison,"Give him time, Wendy. Give him time.  Come on, Mr. Slave.
"
8,12,Paris,"Back off! None of you losers are enough for me!  Eeeaaagh. Oh yeah. Aaaargh.  Tada! 
"
8,12,Randy,"Oh, no she di'int. 
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"Jesus.  Ohoho, Jesus. 
"
8,12,Herbert Garrison,"Now, that's a whore! 
"
8,12,Bebe,"Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all.
"
8,12,Mr. Slave,"People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore.  Being spoiled and stupid and whorish is supposed to be a bad thing, remember? Parents, if you don't teach your children that people like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised, where are they gonna learn it?! You have to be the-  ooohooho, Jesus Christ. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people.
"
8,12,Mr. Stevens,"The homosexual is right. From now on, Bebe, you're going to dress like a little girl. 
"
8,12,Bebe,"Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.
"
8,12,Red,"Yeah, and I didn't mean to say you weren't a whore.
"
8,12,Wendy,"That's okay, you guys. 
"
8,12,Stephen,"So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!
"
8,12,Butters,"I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
"
8,12,Stephen,"You're a grounded old bear.
"
8,12,Paris,"Oh my God, it's so gross! Let me out of here!  What the fuck is that?
"
8,12,Frog King,"Paris, you must find the way out of this place or you'll surely die.
"
8,12,Paris,"What?
"
8,12,Frog King,"Make your way to the small intestine. There you will meet the Sparrow Prince, who can guide you to Catatafish. Now go, Paris Hilton. Make haste! 
"
8,13,Clyde,"I don't know, that looks pretty high up.
"
8,13,Butters,"Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
"
8,13,Stan,"Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. 
"
8,13,Cartman,"This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
"
8,13,Stan,"It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
"
8,13,Cartman,"...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
"
8,13,Kyle,"What's going on?
"
8,13,Stan,"Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. 
"
8,13,Kyle,"Do it! Do it!
"
8,13,Cartman,"I'm gonna!
"
8,13,Craig,"I wouldn't if I were you.
"
8,13,Token,"Those wings don't look very strong.
"
8,13,Kyle,"Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
"
8,13,Kyle,"Awww, go on and do it already!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
"
8,13,Stan,"He's not gonna do it.
"
8,13,Cartman,"And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! 
"
8,13,Liane,"Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Mommy's here. Sweetie?  Oh, what's wrong with him?
"
8,13,Dr. Doctor,"I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma.
"
8,13,Liane,"Coma... My God, fo- for how long?
"
8,13,Dr. Doctor,"There's no telling. He may never recover. We'll just have to wait. And see. 
"
8,13,Singers,"Seasons change, time passes by.
As the weeks become the months become the years.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Eugh... 
"
8,13,Liane,"Oh my- Doctor!  He's awake! 
"
8,13,Cartman,"Wheh? Where am I?
"
8,13,Liane,"Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!
"
8,13,Dr. Doctor,"You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Coma... How long?
"
8,13,Dr. Doctor,"It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now.
"
8,13,Nurse,"Yes, Doctor. 
"
8,13,Dr. Doctor,"Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head trauma. Your road to recovery will be long and arduous. At least another two days. 
"
8,13,Singers,"Seasons change, time passes by. 
As the weeks become the months become the years.
"
8,13,Liane,"You're doing so much better, muffin.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
"
8,13,Liane,"Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.
"
8,13,Dr. Doctor,"I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing we could do.
"
8,13,Yates,"Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore.
"
8,13,Murphy,"We'd better get back to the station, sir.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
"
8,13,Yates,"All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?
"
8,13,Cartman,"Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!
"
8,13,Yates,"Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffered head trauma?
"
8,13,Dr. Doctor,"Yes, it was pretty severe.
"
8,13,Murphy,"What is it, Lou?
"
8,13,Yates,"I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.
"
8,13,Murphy,"Aw, come on, sir.
"
8,13,Yates,"I know it's ridiculous,  but I'm gonna explore every possibility I can!  Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you?
"
8,13,Cartman,"Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
"
8,13,Nurse 2,"Twelve-thirty, Eric. Lunch time. 
"
8,13,Yates,"Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?
"
8,13,Cartman,"I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!
"
8,13,Nurse 2,"Yep, meatloaf again. 
"
8,13,Murphy,"Jesus, how did he...?
"
8,13,Yates,"Little boy...  Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but...  we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer.
"
8,13,Liane,"His new... powers?
"
8,13,Female Detective,"All right, make sure you get pictures of everything in this crime scene. 
"
8,13,Officer 1,"Who's the kid?
"
8,13,Officer 2,"He's supposed to be some kind of psychic.
"
8,13,Officer 1,"Aw, Christ!
"
8,13,Yates,"This is... where the body was found.  Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others.
"
8,13,Cartman,"How come the outline is missing its hand?
"
8,13,Murphy,"The killer always cuts off the left hand of his victim, and keeps it as a trophy. 
"
8,13,Yates,"Stand back, give him room!  Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind?
"
8,13,Cartman,"Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...  He ... He's taking the top of one and...  ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!
"
8,13,Yates,"Jesus Christ!
"
8,13,Murphy,"Sir?
"
8,13,Yates,"Tom Johansen, the owner of the ice cream shop!
"
8,13,Tom Johansen,"Yes? Oh, hello, detectives.
"
8,13,Yates,"Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you?
"
8,13,Tom Johansen,"Sure, come on in!  I'm afraid the house is a little bit of a disaster area since I have-
"
8,13,Yates,"Get him!  Code 6! Code 6!
"
8,13,Officer 3,"Use the taser! Use the taser! 
"
8,13,Officer 4,"Do it again! 
"
8,13,Officer 3,"He put up a hell of a fight, but we got him!
"
8,13,Tom Johansen,"Why?! Why?! 
"
8,13,Yates,"Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history.
"
8,13,Murphy,"We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the people of South Park are safe again is reward enough.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Guess again.
"
8,13,Murphy,"All right, here's a hundred dollars.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Wow!
"
8,13,Yates,"His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers... for good.
"
8,13,Liane,"Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.
"
8,13,Cartman,"I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
"
8,13,Kyle,"Cartman, what did you do?!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! 
"
8,13,Kyle,"Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
"
8,13,Kyle,"Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
"
8,13,Kyle,"You don't have any powers!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
"
8,13,Butters,"Wuh be careful, Kyle.
"
8,13,Kyle,"He can't do crap!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! 
"
8,13,Yates,"There he is! Hey, Eric! Eric!  We've got a little problem.
"
8,13,Cartman,"What?
"
8,13,Yates,"While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed.
"
8,13,Murphy,"This body also had a missing hand and a bowl of corn flakes next to it!
"
8,13,Yates,"Which can only mean one thing!
"
8,13,Kyle,"Ha! You see?!
"
8,13,Yates,"That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!
"
8,13,Kyle,"What?!
"
8,13,Murphy,"We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again.
"
8,13,Cartman,"I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
"
8,13,Chris Swollenballs,"Tom, I'm standing in a meadow just outside of town, where police have discovered the first victim of the serial copycat killer. Child wunderkind Eric Cartman is now arriving on the scene. 
"
8,13,Kyle,"This is fuckin' ridiculous!
"
8,13,Lou,"Whattaya got, wunderkind? Are ya seeing anything?
"
8,13,Cartman,"No. Nothing.
"
8,13,Officer 5,"Maybe his powers have left him.
"
8,13,Officer 6,"Yeah.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
"
8,13,Kyle,"What the hell is wrong with these people?!
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"They're never gonna catch the serial killer. He's too smart. Do you want to see my cotton panties? 
"
8,13,Kyle,"Hey! What about this guy?!
"
8,13,Murphy,"Quiet! He's havin' a vision!
"
8,13,Cartman,"It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
"
8,13,Weird Man,"""Junior, what are you doing out?"" I'm sorry, Mother. ""You come home right now and have sex with me!"" No, Mommy! 
"
8,13,Kyle,"Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!
"
8,13,Lou,"I said quiet, you little brat, or I'll have you arrested for interfering with the law!
"
8,13,Announcer,"This is Park County News 4, with your host, Jim Brown-ish
"
8,13,Jim Brown-ish,"The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand killer has been arrested. Police used the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immediately arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help.
"
8,13,Cartman,"If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
*clap* *clap*  
"
8,13,Liane,"Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.
"
8,13,Cartman,"More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
"
8,13,Liane,"Ah, no, these people claim that they are the ""real"" psychic detectives. 
"
8,13,Female Psychic,"So, you are the little boy who's been taking all our work?!
"
8,13,Liane,"Oooh, I'll go make some tea.
"
8,13,Male Psychic 1,"Kid, we have a problem. You didn't go through the proper channels to become a psychic detective like we all did.
"
8,13,Other psychics,"Yeah!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Proper channels?
"
8,13,Male Psychic 2,"You were supposed to fill out the form on the back of the comic book and pay the twenty five dollar fee for the degree from the Psychic Detective School. 
"
8,13,Cartman,"I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
"
8,13,Male Psychic 1,"Well you just can't say you're a psychic detective, you have to use the ad in the comic book!
"
8,13,Female Psychic,"You must pay the twenty five dollar fee and give us ten percent of your earnings!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Ten percent, my balls, get lost!
"
8,13,Female Psychic,"Very well, then you give us no choice. Roger?
"
8,13,Female Psychic,"All right, everyone! 
"
8,13,Liane,"Oh, goodness! What's going on?
"
8,13,Cartman,"Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
"
8,13,Liane,"O-o-o-o-oh! 
"
8,13,Female Psychic,"Enough!  We are ...obviously quite evenly matched. I guess this will have to be settled in court.
"
8,13,Cartman,"In court?
"
8,13,Female Psychic,"We brought a class-action lawsuit against you! We'll see you before the judge tomorrow! 
"
8,13,Liane,"Is it over? 
"
8,13,Murphy,"Her name is... Veronica Crabtree, bus driver for the elementary school. She was considered an ancillary character, one the fans wouldn't miss much.
"
8,13,Yates,"Jesus Christ! Cause of death?
"
8,13,Murphy,"Same M.O., sir. Multiple stab wounds, left hand cut off and missing.
"
8,13,Yates,"So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?!  Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!
"
8,13,Kyle,"Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.
"
8,13,Lou,"How do you know?! Are you psychic?!
"
8,13,Kyle,"No.
"
8,13,Lou,"Look, kid, don't waste my time with your blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus! I have to find this new killer now! I owe it to that victim over there! I know she hadn't been in any recent episodes, but dammit she deserved better than this! Come on, Murph, we've gotta talk to Eric Cartman again! 
"
8,13,Kyle,"Why won't anybody listen to me?!
"
8,13,Kenny,"(Don't take it personally, Kyle.)
"
8,13,Kyle,"I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.
"
8,13,Stan,"Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!
"
8,13,Token,"There has to be another way!
"
8,13,Kyle,"Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
"
8,13,Butters,"Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.
"
8,13,Stan,"Butters, Goddammit.
"
8,13,Kyle,"All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! 
"
8,13,Stan,"Call an ambulance.
"
8,13,Jim Brown-ish,"Multiple arrests were made today for the murder of Hillary Neals. Police raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m., where seven psychic detectives were staying.  The psychic detectives' horrible crime was found out by psychic detective Eric Cartman,  who is now the only psychic not behind bars. What an amazing coincidence.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"You. You give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness.
"
8,13,Cartman,"... 'Kay. Sweet.
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"Because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. 
"
8,13,Cartman,"Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"You are obviously a big fan of my work.
"
8,13,Cartman,"I don't even know you dude!
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful place in history you have smirched!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus.
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"And now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim.
"
8,13,Cartman,"No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"Before you die, let me show you the things that I've done, so you will understand the breadth of my transformation!  This... is me at the grand canyon.  Do you see? This is me at Mount Rushmore  Do you see?
"
8,13,Cartman,"Heheh.
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"Do you see?!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Yes yes, I see! 
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio.  This was just outside of the gift shop. Do you see?!
"
8,13,Cartman,"AAAAAAAH!
"
8,13,Yates,"Dammit! Dammit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!
"
8,13,Female Detective,"Sorry, Sarge, the psychic's mom says her son hasn't been home for a couple of hours.
"
8,13,Officer 7,"Sir! Dr. Kels just called from the hospital! He says another little boy just awoke from a coma, and is having psychic visions!
"
8,13,Yates,"Let's go! 
"
8,13,Dr. Doctor,"This is the young man here. He was in a coma for over sixteen hours. 
"
8,13,Yates,"Doctor, could you remove his face warmer? We'd like to speak with him.
"
8,13,Dr. Doctor,"Of course. Nurse? 
"
8,13,Yates,"Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder?
"
8,13,Kyle,"I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.
"
8,13,Yates,"What do you think, Mitch?
"
8,13,Murphy,"I don't know. How do we know this kid is really psychic? I mean, this boy is certainly no Eric Cartman. 
"
8,13,Yates,"All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use.
"
8,13,Murphy,"...Sir?
"
8,13,Yates,"You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use?
"
8,13,Murphy,"...Restraint?
"
8,13,Yates,"Yeah, yeah, restraint. We'll check this guy out, but let's use some restraint. 
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"Look! Look at the things I've done! Here I am at Yellowstone National Park!  Do you see?! Here are pictures of my trip to Cheyenne for Frontier Days. Do you see?!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! 
"
8,13,Yates,"Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr...
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"God.
"
8,13,Yates,"Well, Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation. 
"
8,13,Cartman,"(Hey! Come over here!)
"
8,13,Yates,"I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that, too.
"
8,13,Murphy,"Sarge! In here! 
"
8,13,Yates,"Jesus H.... That boy was right! Arrest that guy!  Whoa-whoa-wait-wait-hey-wait-wait-yo! Oh, wait a minute, no ah, I'm wrong.
"
8,13,Murphy,"Sir?
"
8,13,Yates,"This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands.
"
8,13,Murphy,"Right.
"
8,13,Yates,"Well those aren't left hands.  See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands.
"
8,13,Murphy,"Ohhh. 
"
8,13,Yates,"Nope, this isn't our man.  We're sorry, Mr. God. It appears we've wasted your time. 
"
8,13,Cartman,"(Hey! Help!) 
"
8,13,Murphy,"Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall. Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer.
"
8,13,Yates,"Yeah... Amazing coincidence...
"
8,13,Murphy,"Heh- sir?
"
8,13,Yates,"Call it police intuition, but somethin' in there just didn't feel right.  Wait a minute.
"
8,13,Murphy,"Sarge...  What is it?
"
8,13,Yates,"I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests. 
"
8,13,Yates,"Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing?
"
8,13,Murphy,"Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir? Uh, for the serial killer?
"
8,13,Yates,"Oh right! The hands! Right! 
"
8,13,Yates,"Oh my God. Murphy!  You're not gonna believe this.
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"That's it, no more pictures.  Time to die.
"
8,13,Cartman,"No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
"
8,13,Michael Deets,"Your hand will be one with the others.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna-  I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! 
"
8,13,Yates,"Hold it right there, killer! 
"
8,13,Cartman,"You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
"
8,13,Yates,"Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail.
"
8,13,Tom Johansen,"Yes, thank you very much, Kyle.
"
8,13,Female Psychic,"Yes, thanks.
"
8,13,Murphy,"You're certainly a better psychic then Eric.
"
8,13,Kyle,"No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.
"
8,13,Murphy,"Do you think that's true?
"
8,13,Yates,"It must be true. The kid is psychic.  But I don't suppose it really matters much. Because in the end, the way I caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned police work. Come on, Murphy. 
"
8,13,Female Psychic,"Well young man, I guess that just leaves one score to settle.
"
8,13,Cartman,"You can't hurt me.
"
8,13,Male Psychic 1,"Then let this be our final battle! 
"
8,13,Kyle,"Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.
"
8,14,Narrator,"Way up in the mountains in a small little town,
The Main Street was being decorated all up and down.
People stood in long lines, sometimes waiting hours or more,
Because Christmas needs to be bought in a store.
But out in the forest, not too far away...
"
8,14,Narrator,"...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas Day.
"
8,14,Woodland Critters,"It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near.
A Woodland Critter Christmas!
"
8,14,Narrator,"The little critters worked hard as they happily sang,
And each one of them had a quite interesting name.
There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit,
Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear.
Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,
Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer.
Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,
and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house.
And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that,
was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat.
"
8,14,Stan,"What the hell?
"
8,14,Singer,"Christmastime is once a year
Every critter holds it dear
Every animal big or small
Christmas means so much to us all
"
8,14,Rabbity,"Well, hello there. Welcome to our forest.
"
8,14,Skunky,"How do you like our Christmas tree?
"
8,14,Stan,"It's... nice.
"
8,14,Beavery,"Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest! 
"
8,14,Mousey,"Oh no, I see a problem.
"
8,14,Deery,"What is it, Mousey?
"
8,14,Mousey,"Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star.
"
8,14,Critters,"Awww.
"
8,14,Beary,"We can't have a tree with no star on it.
"
8,14,Rabbity,"What are we gonna do?
"
8,14,Squirrely,"Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star.
"
8,14,Critters,"Can you really? Oh would you please? Could you help us?
"
8,14,Stan,"Okay, okay.
"
8,14,Critters,"Yay!
"
8,14,Narrator,"And so, using some paper and working with glee,
the boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree.
"
8,14,Critters,"Ohhhh!
"
8,14,Beary,"It's the nicest star I ever saw.
"
8,14,Narrator,"The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile...
"
8,14,Beavery,"How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while?
"
8,14,Narrator,"The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said...
"
8,14,Stan,"Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. 
"
8,14,Beavery,"Goo- goodbye Stanny!
"
8,14,Critters,"Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat!
"
8,14,Stan,"Woof.
"
8,14,Critters,"Hi, Stanny!
"
8,14,Stan,"Oh, whatta? 
"
8,14,Narrator,"His friends were all there! What a wonderful surprise!
The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes!
"
8,14,Stan,"What time is it?!
"
8,14,Squirrely,"You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!
"
8,14,Skunky,"Porcupiney is pregnant!
"
8,14,Stan,"You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
"
8,14,Mousey,"I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization.
"
8,14,Deery,"Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her conception was immaculate.
"
8,14,Foxy,"She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior.
"
8,14,Stan,"...What?
"
8,14,Porcupiney,"It has been foretold unto me that I would give birth on Christmas Day.
"
8,14,Mousey,"So soon!
"
8,14,Skunky,"How delightful!
"
8,14,Woodpeckery,"Our souls are saved!
"
8,14,Chickadee-y,"Finally the critters are gonna have a Savior of their very own, of their very own! 
"
8,14,Squirrely,"There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in.
"
8,14,Critters,"Awwww.
"
8,14,Beary,"But we got to have a manger.
"
8,14,Rabbity,"Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us a manger? Huh?
"
8,14,Critters,"(Cheers)
"
8,14,Narrator,"""Of course I'll build you a little manger!"" the little boy cried,
and he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side!
"
8,14,Narrator,"And out in the woods the boy steamed right ahead,
making a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head,
"
8,14,Rabbity,"Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger I ever saw.
"
8,14,Mousey,"I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place, for the Son of our Lord.
"
8,14,Raccoony,"Does this mean we can go to sleep now?
"
8,14,Porcupiney,"My son will have the nicest bed in all the forest.
"
8,14,Woodpeckery,"Fit for a king!
"
8,14,Squirrely,"This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever!
"
8,14,Woodland Critters,"It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near --
"
8,14,Stan,"All right, I'm going now. 
"
8,14,Critters,"The mountain lion! Hide! 
"
8,14,Stan,"Go away! Shoo! 
"
8,14,Squirrely,"Is it gone?
"
8,14,Mousey,"I deduce it is.
"
8,14,Skunky,"I'm not c-c-comin' out.
"
8,14,Foxy,"Well, this is the end. The mountain lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant, and he's gonna kill it again.
"
8,14,Stan,"Again?
"
8,14,Squirrely,"Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.
"
8,14,Porcupiney,"Oh dear, I'm so very afraid.
"
8,14,Beavery,"Let's face it. The mountain lion will never let our Savior be born.
"
8,14,Critters,"Awwww! 
"
8,14,Squirrely,"Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny!
"
8,14,Raccoony,"Of course! Stanny can do anything! If he can build a manger, he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion!
"
8,14,Porcupiney,"Christmas is saved! 
"
8,14,Narrator,"High up in the forest on a dark, craggy peak,
the horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weak.
For the critters to be saved, someone had to stop that nasty old cat...
"
8,14,Stan,"Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!
"
8,14,Narrator,"Said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
"
8,14,Narrator,"Killing a mountain lion was no easy task,
But he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast.
"
8,14,Stan,"Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr! 
"
8,14,Narrator,"In a flash, it was over! A victorious blow!
The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below.
"
8,14,Stan,"Okay, there. 
"
8,14,Lion Cub 1,"Mommy? Mommy!  W... wake up, Mommy, wake up!
"
8,14,Lion Cub 2,"Don't leave us, Mommy.  Man-boy, why? Why did you kill our mommy? Why?
"
8,14,Stan,"I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? 
"
8,14,Narrator,"The tiny cubs all gathered together and cried,
All alone in the world because their mother had died.
"
8,14,Stan,"Aw- awww!
"
8,14,Porcupiney,"Oooo.
"
8,14,Beary,"You all right, Lady Porcupiney?
"
8,14,Porcupiney,"Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all.
"
8,14,Beavery,"Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead.
"
8,14,Foxy,"Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole.
"
8,14,Rabbity,"I guess that means our Savior is gonna be made into Savior stew.
"
8,14,Critters,"Awwww.
"
8,14,Chickadee-y,"Wait a minute, look! 
"
8,14,Critters,"Stanny! 
"
8,14,Mousey,"Stanny, you're alive.
"
8,14,Beary,"But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion?
"
8,14,Stan,"It's dead.
"
8,14,Deery,"For real and for true?
"
8,14,Beavery,"Are you sure?
"
8,14,Stan,"I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
"
8,14,Squirrely,"He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!
"
8,14,Critters,"Hail Satan!
"
8,14,Stan,"Wait, wha-what?
"
8,14,Beavery,"You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist!
"
8,14,Critters,"Yaaay! 
"
8,14,Stan,"Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
"
8,14,Squirrely,"Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness.
"
8,14,Stan,"But I thought you meant the Son of God!
"
8,14,Deery,"Well, think about it: You really think God would have sex with a porcupine?
"
8,14,Chickadee-y,"No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness and King of all Evil would do that! Yay!
"
8,14,Foxy,"This just calls for a celebration! Let's sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!
"
8,14,Rabbity,"Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!
"
8,14,Chickadee-y,"Drink his blood! Drink his blood!
"
8,14,Squirrely,"Blood orgy!
"
8,14,Critters,"Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay!
"
8,14,Critters,"What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.
"
8,14,Squirrely,"Hail Satan.
"
8,14,Narrator,"In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas Eve morn,
The little forest critters prepared for the Antichrist to be born.
The noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years past,
But now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassed.
And meanwhile, three lion cubs were crying away.
For them, there would certainly be no Christmas Day.
And soon the forest would suffer from the offspring Satan begat.
All of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat.
"
8,14,Stan,"Ugh.
"
8,14,Narrator,"Now that he'd killed the noble lion queen,
there was nobody to stop the Apocalypse, it seemed.
"
8,14,Stan,"Uuugh!
"
8,14,Narrator,"""I know!"" he said with a new happy grin,
""I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!""
"
8,14,Stan,"No, no-no-no.
"
8,14,Narrator,"He ran out the living room, turned out the light,
and went back to the forest to set everything right!
But his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did flee... He thought he could hide from his problems - not true!
He knew in his heart the thing he had to do!
"
8,14,Stan,"Leave me alone!!
"
8,14,Narrator,"He knew that only by going to the forest could he --
"
8,14,Stan,"All right, all right, all right! God! 
"
8,14,Beavery,"Hey, look everyone! It's our old pal, Stanny. 
"
8,14,Woodpeckery,"Oh boy, Stanny. You came just in time!
"
8,14,Deery,"Yeah. We've got a big problem.
"
8,14,Squirrely,"The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into.
"
8,14,Chickadee-y,"That way he could take over the whole world! The whole world!
"
8,14,Mousey,"The human must be non-baptized and heathenistic against Christ.
"
8,14,Beavery,"We figured you'd be perfect!
"
8,14,Critters,"Yay!
"
8,14,Stan,"I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
"
8,14,Critters,"Awwwww.
"
8,14,Beary,"But we got to have a human host body for the Antichrist.
"
8,14,Deery,"Oh dear, maybe we won't have a critter C-Christmas after all.
"
8,14,Squirrely,"Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human.
"
8,14,Chickadee-y,"Will you really, Stanny?
"
8,14,Stan,"No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!
"
8,14,Beavery,"To stop us?
"
8,14,Beary,"But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop us, we'd have to use our evil Satanic powers on ya.
"
8,14,Stan,"Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! 
"
8,14,Beary,"Oh boy! Our Satanic powers sure did the trick!
"
8,14,Chickadee-y,"Our powers get stronger every day! Get stronger every day!
"
8,14,Squirrely,"Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion.
"
8,14,Skunky,"And you got rid o'her.
"
8,14,Critters,"Yay!
"
8,14,Narrator,"The boy shook with anger! He broke a sweat and fell ill.
Then he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive on the hill!
"
8,14,Stan,"Oh yeah.
"
8,14,Stan,"Hello? Anybody in there? 
"
8,14,Lion Cub 3,"Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy!
"
8,14,Lion Cub 1,"He's come to kill us now!
"
8,14,Lion Cub 2,"It's okay. I died inside when Mommy was killed anyways.
"
8,14,Lion Cub 3,"Yeah, better this than the slow death we'd face without a mother around.
"
8,14,Stan,"Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
"
8,14,Lion Cub 1,"You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee, you're not too smart, are you, mister?
"
8,14,Stan,"I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!
"
8,14,Lion Cub 3,"Yeah, and you killed her.
"
8,14,Stan,"Well, you're mountain lions.
"
8,14,Lion Cub 2,"Us? No, we're just kids. We still have our baby teeth.
"
8,14,Lion Cub 1,"And our baby claws.
"
8,14,Lion Cub 3,"And a dead mom.
"
8,14,Stan,"There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
"
8,14,Lion Cub 3,"What? You mean like in an abortion?
"
8,14,Lion Cub 2,"Yeah. An abortion. That can work.
"
8,14,Lion Cub 1,"But, we don't know how to give abortions.
"
8,14,Lion Cub 3,"Do you know some place we can learn, mister?
"
8,14,Narrator,"""Where can they learn that?"" the boy said with a frown.
""I know! The abortion clinic just outside of town.""
"
8,14,Stan,"What?!
"
8,14,Narrator,"So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed.
And took them to where abortions are performed.
"
8,14,Stan,"No, he didn't.
"
8,14,Narrator,"Yes, he did.
"
8,14,Stan,"No, he didn't!
"
8,14,Narrator,"Yes, he did.
"
8,14,Stan,"No, he didn't!
"
8,14,Narrator,"Yes... he...  did!
"
8,14,Stan,"Oh, Goddammit! 
"
8,14,Narrator,"Said the boy in the red poofball hat! ""We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!""
"
8,14,Doctor,"Excuse me, what are you doing here?!
"
8,14,Narrator,"The abortion doctor inquired.
"
8,14,Doctor,"If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required!
"
8,14,Stan,"I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
"
8,14,Doctor,"Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform!
It's only three days until Christmas, so I have lots of abortions to perform!
Gather around my table, cute little lions,
I'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'!
"
8,14,Narrator,"And so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair base,
And all day watched abortion after abortion take place.
"
8,14,Singer,"Christmas time is once a year.
Every critter holds it dear.
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means so much to us all.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
And it happens once a year.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.
"
8,14,Stan,"This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.
"
8,14,Critters,"It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
"
8,14,Beary,"Oh look. That little feller is all alone.
"
8,14,Skunky,"Gee, he looks sad. 
"
8,14,Critters,"Hi there!
"
8,14,Kyle,"What the hell?
"
8,14,Beavery,"How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.
"
8,14,Kyle,"My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
"
8,14,Raccoony,"Aww, but why?
"
8,14,Kyle,"Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.
"
8,14,Critters,"Yay!
"
8,14,Beary,"But does that mean you aren't baptized?
"
8,14,Kyle,"No. I'm Jewish.
"
8,14,Critters,"Yay! Yay! 
"
8,14,Beavery,"You've got to come with us!
"
8,14,Deery,"You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!
"
8,14,Kyle,"Huh?
"
8,14,Critters,"Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo!
"
8,14,Critters,"What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.
"
8,14,Squirrely,"Hail Satan.
"
8,14,Narrator,"'Twas the night before Christmas, and above the woods, way up high,
a new bright shiny star hung in the sky.
For the world to be saved there was only one shot,
A little boy with three clubs and an abortion plot.
"
8,14,Stan,"Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?
"
8,14,Lion Cub 3,"Sure. We know how to give abortions now.
"
8,14,Narrator,"He arrived at the critter forest ready to fight,
but then gasped when he saw a most dreadful sight.
"
8,14,Beavery,"Gosh, we did it!
"
8,14,Squirrely,"The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest. 
"
8,14,Narrator,"The Antichrist had been born, sealing the world's fate.
The boy in the red poofball hat... was too late.
"
8,14,Stan,"Too late?! The hell is that?!
"
8,14,Beavery,"Oh. Hiya, Stanny!
"
8,14,Kyle,"Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!
"
8,14,Stan,"It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!
"
8,14,Skunky,"Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist into our human host.
"
8,14,Critters,"Let's go! All right! Woohoo!
"
8,14,Stan,"That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! 
"
8,14,Narrator,"When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard,
And a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird!
"
8,14,Beavery,"Wow, look, there's Santy Claus!
"
8,14,Critters,"Yay!
"
8,14,Raccoony,"Let's eat his flesh! 
"
8,14,Santa,"All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!
"
8,14,Raccoony,"We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the Antichrist with help from our good friend, Stanny.
"
8,14,Skunky,"Death and pain await all living things.
"
8,14,Santa,"Little boy, you should be ashamed!
"
8,14,Stan,"I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
"
8,14,Santa,"Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters! 
"
8,14,Critters,"Aaaaah! 
"
8,14,Stan,"Dude, what the-&#160;? 
"
8,14,Singers,"Hold steady, Santa.
"
8,14,Stan,"Come on, dude. 
"
8,14,Beary,"Gee whiz, Santa, you're not gonna kill me, are you- 
"
8,14,Dark Cub,"But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist? 
"
8,14,Santa,"Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into.
"
8,14,Kyle,"No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!
"
8,14,Stan,"What?! Kyle?!
"
8,14,Kyle,"With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!
"
8,14,Santa,"Don't do it, Kyle! 
"
8,14,Stan,"Dude!
"
8,14,Kyle,"Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!
"
8,14,Kyle,"Oh, stop it, Cartman! 
"
8,14,Kyle,"Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
"
8,14,Cartman,"I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. 
"
8,14,Kyle,"This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
"
8,14,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
"
8,14,Mr. Garrison,"Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.
"
8,14,Cartman,"All right, fine! Forget it! 
"
8,14,Butters,"Well but, but what happened?
"
8,14,Token,"Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?
"
8,14,Clyde,"What happens to the lion cubs?
"
8,14,Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
"
8,14,Stan,"No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
"
8,14,Kyle,"Dude, why do you care?!
"
8,14,Stan,"Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
"
8,14,Kyle,"Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
"
8,14,Cartman,"That's not at all what happens.
"
8,14,Butters,"Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.
"
8,14,Clyde,"Yeah yeah, come on! 
"
8,14,Kyle,"All right, fine!
"
8,14,Cartman,"""Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?"" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
"
8,14,Kyle,"HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the --  Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this!  I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!
"
8,14,Stan,"Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
"
8,14,Kyle,"Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.
"
8,14,Santa,"I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you! 
"
8,14,Stan,"No Santa, don't!
"
8,14,Santa,"We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul.
"
8,14,Narrator,"The little boy fretted. He almost started to bawl,
But that's when he came up with the best idea of all.
"
8,14,Stan,"The lion cubs!
"
8,14,Narrator,"The little boy quickly begun,
"
8,14,Stan,"I took them to see how abortions are done.
"
8,14,Santa,"What?
"
8,14,Stan,"Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!
"
8,14,Narrator,"And in the twinkling starlight, each little cub did their portion.
They remembered all they had learned and gave Kyle an abortion.
"
8,14,Kyle,"Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.
"
8,14,Santa,"Well little boy, it seems that you  have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?
"
8,14,Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, there is.
"
8,14,Mother Lion,"Wha -- Oh my, what happened?
"
8,14,One of the Cubs,"Mommy?
"
8,14,The Cubs,"Yay! You're back! We missed you, Mommy!
"
8,14,Stan,"Oh, good.
"
8,14,Narrator,"And back home, there were presents, and lots of food to get fat.
And it was the best Christmas ever for the boy in the red poofball hat.
"
8,14,Narrator,"And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later. 
"
8,14,Kyle,"Goddammit, Cartman!
"
8,14,Singers,"Christmastime is once a year,
Every creature holds it dear,
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means the world to us all,
It's once a year, it's Christmastime,
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.
