4,1,Butters,"Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?
"
4,1,Sledders,"Ready!
"
4,1,Butters,"On your marks! Get set! Uh-go! 
"
4,1,Stan,"We win again! 
"
4,1,Token,"That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!
"
4,1,Stan,"Sleds are for guys.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"These are the school's sleds, ass rammers, not yours!
"
4,1,Stan,"Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
"
4,1,The rest of the boys,"Yeah!
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Oh yeah?!
"
4,1,The Girls,"Yeah!
"
4,1,Cartman,"We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"How about a race down a real hill, then?!
"
4,1,The Girls,"Yeah!
"
4,1,Stan,"You got it!
"
4,1,The rest of the boys,"Yeah!
"
4,1,A few others,"Yeah!
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!
"
4,1,Stan,"Noo problem!
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!
"
4,1,Stan,"Oh, boy! We'll show them!
"
4,1,Butters,"Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
"
4,1,Clyde,"Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are.
"
4,1,Token,"Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! 
"
4,1,Kyle,"Fatass.
"
4,1,Cartman,"There! 
"
4,1,Token,"Oh! 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay?
"
4,1,Liane,"Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?
"
4,1,Cartman,"I'm sorry, Mom.
"
4,1,Liane,"Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!
"
4,1,Cartman,"I'm sorry, Token.
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks is bad, Eric.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day.  See ya later.
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks!
"
4,1,Cartman,"No way!
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go- 
"
4,1,Man 1,"Counselor Mackey?
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Yes?
"
4,1,Man 1,"I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with  the FBI.
"
4,1,Agent Keen,"We're here to investigate the rock-throwing incident.
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention.
"
4,1,Agent Sharp,"I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor.You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered  a hate crime.
"
4,1,Cartman,"...What the hell is a hate crime?
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-
"
4,1,Agent Keen,"New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense.
"
4,1,Cartman,"What? A federal offense?
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Oh no.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh no??
"
4,1,Agent Keen,"We're sorry, Ms. Cartman, but we must follow protocol.  Your son will be taken into custody and then tried in a federal court of law. 
"
4,1,Liane,"Oh my goodness.
"
4,1,Announcer,"The hate crime trial of the century is underway  on Court TV tracks U van. . Live. Here's your host, Leslie Smith.
"
4,1,Leslie,"What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious, hate-crime-committing racist? We take you live to the courtroom  as the defendant takes the stand.
"
4,1,Prosecutor,"Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of ""Token?""
"
4,1,Cartman,"Uh, yes?
"
4,1,Prosecutor,"Who is Token?
"
4,1,Cartman,"He's a black kid that goes to my school?
"
4,1,Prosecutor,"Black!  Did you say black?! You called him black?!
"
4,1,Cartman,"He is black.
"
4,1,Prosecutor,"O! He said it again!  He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out!
"
4,1,Cartman,"I did?
"
4,1,Prosecutor,"The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!!
"
4,1,Cartman,"No! I hate hippies!
"
4,1,Prosecutor,"What?!
"
4,1,Cartman,"I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!
"
4,1,Liane,"Oo, poopiekins?
"
4,1,Prosecutor,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This ""monster"" committed a crimeâ€”not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!
"
4,1,Prosecutor,"The prosecution rests.
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"Don't forget: we still have a sledding race this Saturday, pillow biters. 
"
4,1,"Stan, Kyle","We know!
"
4,1,Stan,"Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
"
4,1,Judge,"Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one.
"
4,1,Cartman,"No!
"
4,1,Judge,"I am making an example of you, to send a message out to people everywhere: that if you want to hurt another human being, you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are!  Court is adjourned! 
"
4,1,The Girls,"Woohoo! Hooray!
"
4,1,Judge,"Bailiffs, escort this little bastard to Juvenile Hall.
"
4,1,Black Bailiff,"Yes, sir. 
"
4,1,White Bailiff,"Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he go? 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!
"
4,1,Kenny,"(What the fuck for?!)
"
4,1,Cartman,"They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
"
4,1,Kenny,"(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
"
4,1,Cartman,"Calm down, Kenny!
"
4,1,Kenny,"(Hey!)
"
4,1,Cartman,"Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
"
4,1,Kenny,"(Yes)
"
4,1,Cartman,"Well, come on! I don't have much time! 
"
4,1,Anchor,"A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg?
"
4,1,Greg Nimins,"Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him  but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway.  Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!
"
4,1,Kenny,"(Why don'tcha keep your head down?!) 
"
4,1,Greg Nimins,"Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading.  This could be the final stand-off.
"
4,1,Policeman 1,"Alright, that's far enough. Stop the Go-Go Action Bronco and come out with your hands up.  Just bring it to a stop and come on out.  Jeezus, he's gonna ram it!  Crazy son of a bitch.
"
4,1,Greg Nimins,"Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended. 
"
4,1,Kyle,"What the hell are they doing?
"
4,1,Greg Nimins,"The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.
"
4,1,Stan,"Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
"
4,1,Kyle,"Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God dammit! 
"
4,1,Stan,"Hello?
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!
"
4,1,Stan,"Son of a bitch!
"
4,1,Driver,"Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.
"
4,1,Warden,"Prisoner 24601, arriving.  Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500.  Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband.  At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper! 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"I am!  And I don't want no new cellmate!
"
4,1,Warden,"You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Oh, I will!  You bet your ass I will.
"
4,1,Stan,"Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. 
"
4,1,Stan,"Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
"
4,1,Butters,"...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.
"
4,1,Clyde,"Huh?
"
4,1,Kyle,"Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.
"
4,1,Clyde,"I'm not fat.
"
4,1,Stan,"Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
"
4,1,Clyde,"Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.
"
4,1,Stan,"Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 
"
4,1,Kyle,"Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.
"
4,1,Girl In Pink,"See you Saturday, poo sniffers!
"
4,1,Stan,"Nice going, fat boy!
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!
"
4,1,Inmates,"Yeah!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"...Neither do we
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh, thank you, Jesus.  So we're friends now?
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in ""friends.""
"
4,1,Inmates,"Yeah!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here.
"
4,1,Stan,"Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!
"
4,1,Pip,"Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
"
4,1,Clyde,"So I don't get to be on the team now?
"
4,1,All the boys,"Shut up, fatass!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 
"
4,1,Stan,"Come on, let's get it a try. 
"
4,1,"Kenny, Stan","Woopee!
"
4,1,Stan,"Yeah-
"
4,1,"Stan, Kenny, Kyle","Wo-o-o-o-oh! 
"
4,1,Stan,"Dude, bail! Bail! 
"
4,1,Kenny,"(Huh? Uh.)  (AAAAAA!)  (Ufff!)  (Ugh!)
"
4,1,Stan,"Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.
"
4,1,Kyle,"We killed Kenny?
"
4,1,Stan,"We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. 
"
4,1,Kyle,"Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
"
4,1,Stan,"Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
"
4,1,Butters,"Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!
"
4,1,Pip,"This is a sad day for men everywhere.
"
4,1,Stan,"You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
"
4,1,All the boys,"Yeup.
"
4,1,Kyle,"If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
"
4,1,Butters,"Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"Woohoo. Great time, girls.  Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers! 
"
4,1,Stan,"That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
"
4,1,Some boys,"Oh?
"
4,1,Other boys,"Huh?
"
4,1,Kyle,"How?
"
4,1,Stan,"I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Sweet! Let's go!
"
4,1,The group,"Hooray! Alright! Here we go!
"
4,1,Mother 1,"And have you been brushing your teeth?
"
4,1,Boy 1,"Yes, Mommy.
"
4,1,Mother 1,"And not dropping your soap?
"
4,1,Boy 1,"Yes, Mommy.
"
4,1,Boy 2,"Hi, Mom.
"
4,1,Mother 2,"Young man, that is the fourth time you've been late for our visiting time; you are grounded.
"
4,1,Boy 2,"Grounded? On, no! Um, wait... 
"
4,1,Guard,"Here you go, boys. Keep it short.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Hey you guys.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Hey, fatass. How's prison?
"
4,1,Cartman,"Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?
"
4,1,Stan,"Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
"
4,1,Cartman,"A what?
"
4,1,Kyle,"An ailnay ilefay.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Wwhat's that?
"
4,1,Kyle,"Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!
"
4,1,Stan,"Yeah, you stupid umbassday!
"
4,1,Cartman,"I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here
"
4,1,Kyle,"They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!
"
4,1,Stan,"...Yeah.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
"
4,1,Kyle,"Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
"
4,1,Cartman,"Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
"
4,1,Stan,"Sshh! 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.
"
4,1,Stan,"How are we supposed to give them to you?
"
4,1,Cartman,"Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
"
4,1,Stan,"But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
"
4,1,Cartman,"I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!
"
4,1,Stan,"Alright, here. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Well, okay... here... l'see...
"
4,1,Stan,"Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Me too.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. 
"
4,1,Kyle,"Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. 
"
4,1,Stan,"That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. 
"
4,1,Kyle,"So now what do we do?
"
4,1,Stan,"There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Well, did you get the cigarettes?
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes.  One.  Heh, two.  Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh  yeahhh. Hoh. Phew.  Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit! 
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"You flushed them?!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Son of a bitch!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
"
4,1,Stan,"Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?
"
4,1,Stan,"Yeah. 
"
4,1,Linda Black,"Hello?
"
4,1,Stan,"Hi. Can Token come out and play?
"
4,1,Linda Black,"Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like. 
"
4,1,Kyle,"Killer.
"
4,1,Stan,"Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
"
4,1,Token,"No.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!
"
4,1,Token,"Yeah.
"
4,1,Steve Black,"I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys.
"
4,1,Stan,"It's not?
"
4,1,Steve Black,"No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry.
"
4,1,Steve Black,"No, I'd, actually agree with you.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Huh?
"
4,1,Steve Black,"Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I'd love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind.
"
4,1,Stan,"Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
"
4,1,Steve Black,"Oh, he wouldn't listen to me.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Why not?
"
4,1,Steve Black,"Because I'm black.
"
4,1,"Stan, Kyle","Oh.
"
4,1,Steve Black,"Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh.  Here you go, God-damnit!
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game.  Ew, it smells, man.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!
"
4,1,Cartman,"But you said-
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?
"
4,1,Cartman,"I thought that-
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house.  Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw  Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess.  Hey. Uh, what are you doing?  You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!
"
4,1,Cartman,"I want my Mo-omm 
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Dude. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Mommy, I want my Mommy! 
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here.
"
4,1,Cartman,"You will?
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland.
"
4,1,Aide,"Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?
"
4,1,Governor,"Naw, not another committee. Send them in.  This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee?
"
4,1,Token,"Yeah.
"
4,1,Governor,"Well, boys, what can I do for you?
"
4,1,Stan,"Okay, go ahead and start.
"
4,1,Kyle,"I don't start, you start.
"
4,1,Stan,"Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy.""  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
"
4,1,Token,"If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.
"
4,1,Kyle,"And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?
"
4,1,Stan,"If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
"
4,1,Token,"And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.
"
4,1,Stan,"Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
"
4,1,Kyle,"But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.
"
4,1,Stan,"That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
"
4,1,Token,"""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."" 
"
4,1,Governor,"Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us!  Mph. Oowww!
"
4,1,Cartman,"What's the matter?
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"It's my leg! I think it's broken.  You go on ahead without me.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Uhokay. 
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Hey.  You're supposed to say, ""I'm not going without you,"" or something.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh. Really?
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Okay. 
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"No! You're supposed to say, ""I can't take these,"" or something, dumbass!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh. I can't take these. 
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Take them. They'll bring you luck.  Now go on. Get out of here. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Romper?
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Yeah?
"
4,1,Cartman,"You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
"
4,1,Guard,"Alright, freeze! 
"
4,1,Cartman,"You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!
"
4,1,Guard,"But you've been pardoned by the governor! 
"
4,1,Cartman,"O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. 
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!
"
4,1,Stan,"Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
"
4,1,Kyle,"He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!
"
4,1,Bebe,"Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
"
4,1,Stan,"Alright, where's Clyde.
"
4,1,Clyde,"Right here.
"
4,1,Stan,"Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
"
4,1,Clyde,"For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! 
"
4,1,Kyle,"On the sled, fatass!
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!
"
4,1,Other girls,"Yeah!
"
4,1,Butters,"Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-
"
4,1,Cartman,"You guys! 
"
4,1,Stan,"It's Cartman!
"
4,1,Boy Sledders,"Hooray!
"
4,1,Cartman,"That's right! I'm back! 
"
4,1,Clyde,"Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you.
"
4,1,Cartman,"What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!
"
4,1,Stan,"All right! Let's do this!
"
4,1,Butters,"Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.
"
4,1,Cartman,"I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
"
4,1,Butters,"Uh-get set. Go! 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Go, fatass!
"
4,1,Cartman,"When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
"
4,1,"Token, Kyle, Stan","Go, fatass! 
"
4,1,Stan,"Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! 
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"We've got' em, girls!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
"
4,1,Kids at Finish Line,"Go! You can do it! Come on!
"
4,1,Stan,"We're not gonna make it! 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Hey. 
"
4,1,Girl in Pink,"G'aaaaah! 
"
4,1,Bear,"Rowr.
"
4,1,Boy Sledders,"Hooray!
"
4,1,Stan,"We did it!
"
4,1,Girls,"Awww. 
"
4,1,Kyle,"We won! We won!
"
4,1,Butters,"Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!
"
4,1,Boys,"Hooray!
"
4,1,Kyle,"It's good to have you back, Cartman.
"
4,1,Stan,"Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.
"
4,1,Pip,"Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass!  Oh-ff. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
"
4,1,"Stan, Kyle, Butters, Token","Naah.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
4,1,Guard,"Hey! Romper Stomper! Get up!  You got a visitor! 
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Eric!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Hey, Romper Stomper.
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Wow! I've never had a visitor before!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"You did? 
"
4,1,Cartman,"You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Yeah. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Whoa! 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Oh, yeah!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! 
"
4,1,Romper Stomper,"Oh, the monorail!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
"
4,2,Liane,"What is it, snookums?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
"
4,2,Liane,"Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yeah! This is so tits!
"
4,2,Liane,"Don't say ""tits,"" Eric.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
"
4,2,Liane,"Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! 
"
4,2,Liane,"But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously!  Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't you stoked?!
"
4,2,Stan,"What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
"
4,2,Kyle,"He's fat and he's stupid?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! 
"
4,2,Stan,"Two dollars!
"
4,2,Kyle,"No way!
"
4,2,Stan,"For one tooth?
"
4,2,Cartman,"For one tooth.
"
4,2,Stan,"Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
"
4,2,Kyle,"I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
"
4,2,Kyle,"...Totally what?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.
"
4,2,"Stan, Kyle, Kenny","Sega Dreamcast??
"
4,2,Cartman,"All we need is teeth.
"
4,2,Stan,"I already lost all my baby teeth.
"
4,2,Kyle,"Me too. 
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Nuh-uh.)
"
4,2,Kyle,"You still have baby teeth, Kenny?
"
4,2,Kenny,"(No way!)
"
4,2,Cartman,"Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?
"
4,2,Kenny,"(No I don't! Thank you.)
"
4,2,Cartman,"Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!
"
4,2,Stan,"Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
"
4,2,Kyle,"Almost. You ready, Timmy?
"
4,2,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,2,Kyle,"When I say ""go,"" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
"
4,2,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Right. You're Timmy.
"
4,2,Timmy,"Timmiihh! Lemmeouttaheah!
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
"
4,2,Cartman,"I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny.
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Fuck you!)
"
4,2,Kyle,"Alright! Get ready, Timmy.
"
4,2,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,2,Butters,"Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?
"
4,2,Stan,"What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
"
4,2,Butters,"Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. 
"
4,2,"Stan, Cartman","You what?
"
4,2,Kenny,"(You what?)
"
4,2,Timmy,"Timmih-
"
4,2,Butters,"Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
"
4,2,Stan,"Uh, Butters, could we have it?
"
4,2,Butters,"Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.
"
4,2,Timmy,"Ha-a-ugh.
"
4,2,Butters,"Well, uh, see ya, fellas. 
"
4,2,Kyle,"Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
"
4,2,Stan,"Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
4,2,Cartman,"How are we gonna get it from him?
"
4,2,Stan,"I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
"
4,2,Kyle,"Yeah, let's go. 
"
4,2,Timmy,"Go! Timmy go!  Yeah, Timmy! 
"
4,2,Kyle,"No, Timmy, wait!
"
4,2,Timmy,"Engh go uh Timmy! 
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Hey, guys!)  (Heey-ungh)  (Oowww.)
"
4,2,Cartman,"Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
"
4,2,Timmy,"Hu-aah!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Higher, you guys.
"
4,2,Stan,"Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, camera left!  That's it, now down. 
"
4,2,Butters,"What the-?  Who's there? Who is that?!
"
4,2,Cartman,"I am the tooth fairy, my child.
"
4,2,Butters,"Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? 
"
4,2,Cartman,"Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. 
"
4,2,Butters,"Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Ey!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Come on, fatass!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  Square in the nuts.
"
4,2,Butters,"Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!
"
4,2,Stan,"Well?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Bull's eye!
"
4,2,Liane,"Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.
"
4,2,Cartman,"I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
"
4,2,Liane,"No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Okay.
"
4,2,Liane,"Good night.  What do you have there, Eric?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
"
4,2,Liane,"Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.
"
4,2,Cartman,"I know, huh?
"
4,2,Cartman,"You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
"
4,2,Kyle,"Did the tooth fairy come?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Four dollars. 
"
4,2,Stan,"Oh my God!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Four dollars?
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Oh, my God!)
"
4,2,Cartman,"Do you what this means?
"
4,2,Stan,"Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. 
"
4,2,A Dentist,"Dentist office.
"
4,2,Liane,"Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman.
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you?
"
4,2,Liane,"Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost?
"
4,2,Liane,"About a hundred and twelve.
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"...A hundred and twelve.
"
4,2,Liane,"Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"Your son wouldn't happen to be an ""alligator,"" would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it.
"
4,2,Liane,"O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week. 
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"What?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom!
"
4,2,Liane,"Yes, Eric
"
4,2,Cartman,"You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
"
4,2,Liane,"Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.
"
4,2,Cartman,"You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?
"
4,2,Liane,"I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
"
4,2,Liane,"No, honey. It's just-
"
4,2,Cartman,"How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
"
4,2,Liane,"Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.
"
4,2,Cartman,"How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.
"
4,2,Liane,"Eric! Eric, wait!
"
4,2,Cartman,"No, Mother! No more lies! 
"
4,2,Stan,"Dude, where's the money?
"
4,2,Cartman,"There is no money.
"
4,2,Kyle,"No more money??
"
4,2,Stan,"What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
"
4,2,Cartman,"I know!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Cartman, what's going on?!
"
4,2,Cartman,"You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.
"
4,2,Stan,"Tell us what?!
"
4,2,Cartman,"You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. 
"
4,2,Kyle,"What do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?""
"
4,2,Cartman,"My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
"
4,2,Stan,"Dude.
"
4,2,Kyle,"That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
"
4,2,Cartman,"But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny. 
"
4,2,Kyle,"You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Kyle, open your eyes, man!
"
4,2,Kyle,"It's not true! 
"
4,2,Gerald,"Oh, hello, son. 
"
4,2,Kyle,"Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
"
4,2,Gerald,"What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. 
"
4,2,Kyle,"Oh my God! You did lie to me.
"
4,2,Gerald,"No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.
"
4,2,Kyle,"Peter Pan, too??
"
4,2,Gerald,"Kyle...
"
4,2,Kyle,"What about Moses and Abraham?
"
4,2,Gerald,"Well, they were probably real.
"
4,2,Kyle,"Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
"
4,2,Gerald,"Probably not.
"
4,2,Kyle,"Wahahahah!
"
4,2,Gerald,"Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.
"
4,2,Kyle,"Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! 
"
4,2,Cartman,"Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
"
4,2,Kyle,"What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
"
4,2,Cartman,"No, man, that's just a TV show.
"
4,2,Stan,"You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
"
4,2,Cartman,"What? That your parents lied to you, too?
"
4,2,Stan,"Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
"
4,2,Cartman,"How?
"
4,2,Stan,"Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
"
4,2,Kyle,"All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
"
4,2,Stan,"So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
4,2,Stan,"The kid will never even know.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
"
4,2,Stan,"We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
4,2,Kyle,"I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
"
4,2,Stan,"Come on, Kyle! 
"
4,2,Kyle,"What if this is all just somebody's dream?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Wow, look at the size of these houses!
"
4,2,Stan,"Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  ""Tooth Fairy.""
"
4,2,Cartman,"Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. 
"
4,2,Stan,"There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Got it. 
"
4,2,Stan,"This is the smartest business venture ever. 
"
4,2,Cartman,"What the-? 
"
4,2,Stan,"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
"
4,2,Boy 1,"We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him.
"
4,2,Stan,"...Hey, you can't do that!
"
4,2,Boy 2,"Why not?!
"
4,2,Stan,"Because that's what we're doing!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
"
4,2,Boy 2,"What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Two years?
"
4,2,Blond,"Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?!
"
4,2,Cartman,"It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
"
4,2,Blond,"How dare you! 
"
4,2,Boy 1,"Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!
"
4,2,Stan,"You scram! We were here first!
"
4,2,Rich kid,"What's going on?  Oh! It's the tooth fairies!
"
4,2,Boy 2,"Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up! 
"
4,2,Stan,"You woke him up! 
"
4,2,Rich kid,"I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies but I have been a very good boy.
"
4,2,All,"Shut up!
"
4,2,Boy 1,"Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss!
"
4,2,Stan,"Who's the Boss?
"
4,2,Boy 1,"Loogie.
"
4,2,Loogie,"My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true?
"
4,2,Stan,"Uuh, yeah.
"
4,2,Boy 1,"Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre-  Erp.
"
4,2,Cartman,"We were there first!
"
4,2,Loogie,"Kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years.  I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that.
"
4,2,Stan,"Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
"
4,2,Loogie,"Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what?
"
4,2,Stan,"Well, uh-what do you mean?
"
4,2,Loogie,"How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow? 
"
4,2,Boy 1,"Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!
"
4,2,Stan,"What's a ""tooth trade?""
"
4,2,Loogie,"Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved.  We keep careful track of what houses we've hit so that we don't hit the same one twice in less than two months.  Inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow, but leave a note for Mom and Dad to see.  This is how we let the parents know to leave money under the pillow.  Once the note is in place in the last house, we start all over, going back to the first house. But this time, all we have to do is collect money.  And the kids never know what hit 'em.
"
4,2,The South Park boys,"Wow!
"
4,2,Loogie,"The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries , hockey games , anywhere we can find them 
"
4,2,Beat-up Boy,"Nooo! 
"
4,2,Loogie,"The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality.  But there's never enough teeth. Never enough.
"
4,2,Stan,"Amazing.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Man, that is tits!
"
4,2,Loogie,"And now my only problem is, what do I do with you? 
"
4,2,Boy 1,"Rowwr!
"
4,2,Loogie,"Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me?
"
4,2,Stan,"Oh. Uh-I don't know.
"
4,2,Loogie,"It's that, or else I can cut off your penises. 
"
4,2,Cartman,"Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
"
4,2,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
4,2,Stan,"How much do we get if we work for you?
"
4,2,Loogie,"I'll cut you in at 2%.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent-
"
4,2,Stan,"We're in!
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"Fellow dentists: As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this.  A giant half-chicken/half-squirrel  that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest  for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring! We believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra , and that it-
"
4,2,Dentist,"Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more logical theory.
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us!
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit. 
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds.
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before.
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"Where?!
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"In Montreal. 
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"And where, pray, is this ""Montreal""?!
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand. 
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"Well, I will! 
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"Anyway, the half-chicken/half-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a flotation device.
"
4,2,Boy,"Here! Here, over here, look! Look what I got- I got from the chef! 
"
4,2,Chef,"Hello there, children.
"
4,2,The Boys,"Hey, Chef.
"
4,2,Stan,"We all want double-desserts today!
"
4,2,Chef,"Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. 
"
4,2,Chef,"Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!
"
4,2,Cartman,"That's right. Keep the change, my man.
"
4,2,Chef,"Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!
"
4,2,The Boys,"That there's a time and a place for everything, and it's called ""college.""
"
4,2,Chef,"That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs. 
"
4,2,Little Chef,"Ooo, come on, now.
"
4,2,Kid 1,"Hey, kid. You wanna try some dope?
"
4,2,Girl,"What?
"
4,2,Kid 1,"Come on, kid. Don't you wanna get high?
"
4,2,Little Chef,"Hey, man, I don't need dope. Let me sing you a little song:
I can't wait until I grow up
and my weenie get big and strong
'Cause when it does I'm gonna bust
And make love to you Amanda all night long
I'm gonna make love to y'Amanda in about ten years!
"
4,2,Kid 3,"What?
"
4,2,Kid 2,"What the hell is he talking about?
"
4,2,Little Chef,"And that toothpick is gonna turn into an oak tree,...
"
4,2,Stan,"U-uh, Chef.
"
4,2,Little Chef,"I'ma knock ya down, knock ya up,...
"
4,2,Stan,"Chef!
"
4,2,Little Chef,"...knock ya over, an' knock ya all around.
"
4,2,Stan,"CHEF!
"
4,2,Chef,"Uh?
"
4,2,Stan,"We're not dealing drugs!
"
4,2,Chef,"You're not?
"
4,2,Stan,"No!
"
4,2,Chef,"Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never mind.
"
4,2,The Boys,"Thanks, Chef. 
"
4,2,Kyle,"See ya.
"
4,2,Chef,"Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up. 
"
4,2,Stan,"Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
"
4,2,Stan,"We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Sure, Kyle.
"
4,2,Loogie,"They're what?! They're not gonna pay me? Who the hell do they think they are? I want those South Park kids dead! I want their families dead! I want their houses burned to the ground!  Oh, hi there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are out front, if you need 'em.
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association.
"
4,2,Loogie,"Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some spaghetti?
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted to let you know that I'm onto you.
"
4,2,Loogie,"I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles.
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"I am going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass! 
"
4,2,Cartman,"So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
"
4,2,Odd Boy,"That's right, yeah  . It's all top-grade stuff, too.These Chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see?
"
4,2,Cartman,"How much?
"
4,2,Odd Boy,"Well, huh, Tang Li wants 30, but, but I can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha, buh. Heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh? 
"
4,2,Cartman,"Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
"
4,2,Weasel,"Awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Do you think I'm an idiot?
"
4,2,Weasel,"Huh?
"
4,2,Cartman,"These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?!  Get out of my sight!  Lousy little scum!  What?!
"
4,2,Boy 2,"This is your last chance, kid! Either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes!
"
4,2,Cartman,"I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! 
"
4,2,Kyle,"Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
"
4,2,Boy 2,"He's not gonna do it?!
"
4,2,Kenny,"(He's not gonna do it?!) 
"
4,2,Boy 2,"He's not gonna do it, boss!
"
4,2,Loogie,"Well then, throw him in. 
"
4,2,Boy 1,"Alright, kid. Time to die. 
"
4,2,Kenny,"(No! Nono! No! Don't do this! Nononooo!) 
"
4,2,Boy 2,"Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River?
"
4,2,Anchor,"...to which Ms. Clinton replied, ""I don't even like Vagina."" Finally tonight, a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is live.
"
4,2,Dan Akawa,"Thanks, Tom. I'm here at the house of little Billy Circlovich, um. Billy is in desperate need of a bone-marrow transplant  or he will most certainly die.  Billy, how much more money do you need for the transplant? 
"
4,2,Billy,"Sih, six hundred dollar-. 
"
4,2,Dan Akawa,"Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya!
"
4,2,Billy,"Duh six hundred dohollars.
"
4,2,Dan Akawa,"Well, that's a lot of money.How the hell are you gonna get all that in the short amount of time you have left?
"
4,2,Billy,"Well, I a-I don't know.
"
4,2,Dan Akawa,"Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today.
"
4,2,Billy,"Yehahah.
"
4,2,Dan Akawa,"Billy, we want you to put that tooth under your pillow tonight, because we have a feeling that the tooth fairy  is going to leave you six hundred dollars for it!
"
4,2,Billy,"Really?
"
4,2,Mr. Circlovich,"Really?
"
4,2,Dan Akawa,"Yes, really.  Six hundred dollars. I might also mention that Billy lives in Crestview Apartments, just off Arapaho Road on Emporia Street. Back to you, Tom.  How was that?
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"Perfect. The trap is set.
"
4,2,Cameraman,"Naw, come on. D'ya really think anyone will fall for somethin' that stupid?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together!  This is gonna be tits!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Will somebody take those books away from him?
"
4,2,"Mrs, Circlovich","Be sure to put your loose tooth under your pillow, Billy.
"
4,2,Billy,"Okay-y, Mom. 
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"Thank you for helping out, gentlemen.  If this sting operation works, some bogus tooth fairies should be showing up to take the sick kid's money. When they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm will sound, and that's when you hit the button, Murphy, and activate the lights. Everybody got it?
"
4,2,Dentists,"Got it.
"
4,2,Murphy,"Duuuh, which button do I hit again, boss?  Just kidding. You know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? I was, you know I was actin', I was actin' like him, eheh, oh.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
"
4,2,Kyle,"I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
"
4,2,Stan,"Dude, just stop thinking about it.
"
4,2,Kyle,"But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? 
"
4,2,Kenny,"(You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)
"
4,2,Kyle,"Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.
"
4,2,Billy,"G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad.
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled. 
"
4,2,Billy,"I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant?
"
4,2,Mr. Circlovich,"I think so, Billy. I think so.
"
4,2,Billy,"Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 
"
4,2,Stan,"Kyle?
"
4,2,Murphy,"Eh something strange is happening with the computers. 
"
4,2,Loogie,"Well, well, well. What do we have here?
"
4,2,Stan,"Aw, shit.
"
4,2,Loogie,"Did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? Kolovski , put this buttwipe out of his misery. 
"
4,2,Cartman,"I got it!
"
4,2,Billy,"The tooth fairy! 
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"Let's move out! 
"
4,2,Loogie,"Aw, drat! 
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"Give it up, kids. You're surrounded by dentists.
"
4,2,Loogie,"It was a trap!
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"That's right. And now it's all exposed! You're through! The only thing left to do is to haul all you kids down to prison! 
"
4,2,A voice,"This is reality! I am everywhere , and nowhere.
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"What the hell?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Kyle?
"
4,2,Kyle,"I am nothing, and everything.
"
4,2,Dr. Roberts,"Well, I told you! 
"
4,2,Mr. Foley,"Let's get outta here! 
"
4,2,Kyle,"Hunh. That was pretty weird.
"
4,2,Loogie,"Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup all along!  How could I be so stupid?!
"
4,2,Stan,"What?
"
4,2,Loogie,"I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
"
4,2,Loogie,"Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has fallen.
"
4,2,Stan,"Really?
"
4,2,Loogie,"Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways.
"
4,2,Stan,"So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
"
4,2,Loogie,"Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with.
"
4,2,Kyle,"Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
"
4,2,Cartman,"...Tits.
"
4,2,Timmy,"Timmy!
"
4,3,Randy,"Okay, is everyone ready to go?
"
4,3,Sheila,"Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville.
"
4,3,Sharon,"Me too. We were lucky to get tickets.  Come on, boys! We're gonna be late. 
"
4,3,Liane,"Oh, don't they look precious?
"
4,3,Stan,"Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
"
4,3,Sharon,"No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things..
"
4,3,Kyle,"Awwww!
"
4,3,Grandpa,"Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders!
"
4,3,Sharon,"Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts!
"
4,3,Grandpa,"Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch of frogs prance around in tights and make-up wrappin' their peckers around each others' faces!
"
4,3,Sharon,"Come on, everybody, let's go. 
"
4,3,Grandpa,"Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man.
"
4,3,Sheila,"Oh, this is so exciting
"
4,3,Sharon,"Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley.
"
4,3,Stan,"Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.
"
4,3,Cartman,"He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it!  Ow. 
"
4,3,Randy,"You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? 
"
4,3,Cartman,"Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides! 
"
4,3,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, please, no smoking and no flash-photography during Sarque du Son Bleu
"
4,3,Cartman,"Sarque du Son Bleu.  Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.
"
4,3,Liane,"Eric, sshhhh.

"
4,3,Kenny,"(Woohoo!) 
"
4,3,Cartman,"Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? 
"
4,3,Kyle,"Whoa. 
"
4,3,Stan,"Damn, dude. 
"
4,3,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","Yayy!
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Oh yeah! Woohoo!)
"
4,3,Sheila,"Oh, that was wonderful!
"
4,3,Sharon,"Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again.
"
4,3,Kyle,"Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
"
4,3,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
"
4,3,Cartman,"Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! 
"
4,3,Clown,"Don't forget to buy your souvenirs, folks. 
"
4,3,Stan,"Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.
"
4,3,Kyle,"Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
4,3,Stan,"Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. 
"
4,3,Kyle,"Let's go practice. 
"
4,3,Grandmama,"Hurry up, girls. We must bundle up against the cold.
"
4,3,A Quint,"Did we do good final show, Grandmama?
"
4,3,Grandmama,"Very good, my girls. I only wish it weren't your last show. I love this country so very much. 
"
4,3,Romanian official,"Mrs. Vladchick, it is time. It is time to return to Romania.
"
4,3,Grandmama,"Yes, yes, of course. Just give me vone second to finish getting them ready.  This way, girls. Quickly. 
"
4,3,Quint #2,"Vhy are we going out the window, Grandmama?
"
4,3,Grandmama,"Your mother did not want you to grow up in Romania. This is our only chance.

4,3,Romanian official,"Cauch! We need a boat. 
"
4,3,Native paddler in vest,"Where to, Mack?
"
4,3,Romanian official,"Follow that boat. 
"
4,3,Stan,"Dude, this isn't working.
"
4,3,Kyle,"It's Kenny's singing!
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Hunh?)
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!
"
4,3,Kenny,"(I'm singing as good as I can!)
"
4,3,Stan,"Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 
"
4,3,Grandpa,"Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders.

4,3,Grandmama,"Very good, Glacas.
"
4,3,Stan,"I'm tired, Grandpa.
"
4,3,Grandpa,"No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and watch more McGyver. We've gotta get all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out of ya.  Who the hell would be ringin' the doorbell at this time of night?
"
4,3,Stan,"I don't know.  Whoa. 
"
4,3,Grandmama,"We are very sorry to disturb you. My granddaughters are cold and tired. Is there any possibility we could pay you for a place to sleep?
"
4,3,Randy,"You're from Cirque du Cheville. 
"
4,3,Grandmama,"Yes. We- missed our train. If we could shelter here; it would only be for one night.
"
4,3,Randy,"Well...

4,3,Sharon,"Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow. 
"
4,3,Grandmama,"Oh, thank you so much.

"
4,3,Randy,"Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.
"
4,3,Sharon,"Poor dear must be tired.

4,3,Quint 2,"Ve are twins, except there are five of us instead of two.
"
4,3,Kyle,"But there's only four of you.
"
4,3,Quint 2,"No no, Natalia is just playing mirror buddies with Nadia.
"
4,3,Nadia,"Hello.
"
4,3,Kyle,"So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?
"
4,3,All five quints in unison,"No, don't be ridiculous.
"
4,3,Stan,"Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
"
4,3,A Quint,"You have your own?
"
4,3,Stan,"Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Hey!)
"
4,3,Cartman,"But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!
"
4,3,Quint 1,"Okay.

4,3,Grandpa,"What?!  Oh, dear Jesus!
"
4,3,Randy,"It looks like she had a heart attack.
"
4,3,Grandpa,"No wonder she didn't say good-night.
"
4,3,Randy,"...Ew!
"
4,3,Stan,"Okay, hold it, hold it. 
"
4,3,The boys,"Ow! 
"
4,3,Sharon,"I don't know how to tell. You tell them. 
"
4,3,Randy,"Uh, girls, we... have some bad news.
"
4,3,Quint 5,"What?
"
4,3,Randy,"Um...  Everyone who has a grandma, step forward.  Uh, not so fast, girls. 
"
4,3,Sharon,"Randy! 
"
4,3,Quint 2,"Grandmama is dead?
"
4,3,Quint 1,"What are we going to do now? 
"
4,3,Cartman,"You guys, come here.  This is totally awesome.
"
4,3,Stan,"What?!
"
4,3,Kyle,"How can you say that?
"
4,3,Cartman,"Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
"
4,3,Kyle,"Oh, yeah!
"
4,3,Stan,"Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
"
4,3,Randy,"Well, Stan, it's not really our-
"
4,3,Stan,"They have nowhere else to go.  Please?
"
4,3,Sharon,"Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay.
"
4,3,"Stan, Kyle","Hooray!
"
4,3,Cartman,"Hooray!
"
4,3,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing at the home in South Park where five precious little girls have been rescued from Romania. Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes.  If you'd like to come down and visit the quintuplets, admission is only $5, and for a few dollars more , you can feed them fishsticks.
"
4,3,A Quint,"Mmm.
"
4,3,Reporter,"Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania.
"
4,3,Reporter,"Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world.  Back to you, Tom.
"
4,3,President,"This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid.
"
4,3,Romanian Official,"This could kill our tourism.
"
4,3,President,"You know what to do. 
"
4,3,Instructor,"Alright, Kenny, let's start with some warm-up exercises. 
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha) 
"
4,3,Mrs.McCormick,"Well, what do you think? Can you help him become a better singer?
"
4,3,Instructor,"Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(I wanna be really good)
"
4,3,Instructor,"Well, if you wanna be a real singer, you need to go to a conservatory in Europe. There's no other alternative.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Europe?)
"
4,3,Mrs.McCormick,"We can't afford that.
"
4,3,Instructor,"Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Awww.)
"
4,3,Mrs.McCormick,"Well, Kenny, if it means that much to you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and... you can sing on the way to make money.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
4,3,Sharon,"Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. 
"
4,3,Randy,"What? 
"
4,3,Anchor Tom,"...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago.
"
4,3,Man,"Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.
"
4,3,Randy,"Uh-oh.
"
4,3,Stan,"That's your dad?
"
4,3,Quint 2,"Maybe.
"
4,3,Quint 1,"But we haven't seen papa for more than five years.
"
4,3,Man,"How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.
"
4,3,Voice,"Nadia!
"
4,3,Man,"Nadia, my sweet Barshta
"
4,3,Voice,"Baltania!
"
4,3,Man,"Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right. 
"
4,3,Kyle,"Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.
"
4,3,Stan,"Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
"
4,3,Sharon,"Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we? 
"
4,3,Randy,"I don't know.
"
4,3,Kyle,"You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
"
4,3,Sharon,"We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. 
"
4,3,Cartman,"Damn, we might be screwed.
"
4,3,Stan,"No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 
"
4,3,Cartman,"You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!
"
4,3,A fan,"Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah. 
"
4,3,Cartman,"And shopping malls! Hooray! 
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Woo hoo!)
"
4,3,Romanian Official,"Mrs. Janet Reno, you must understand, the father has right to his children.
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"Yes, but the girls seem to wanna stay here. Why don't you all stay here in America, and this whole thing can go away.
"
4,3,Mr. Vladchick,"Okay.  Heh!
"
4,3,Romanian Official,"Our home is Romania. We love it there.
"
4,3,Mr. Vladchick,"Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there.
"
4,3,Romanian Official,"If daughters will not return on their own, you must force them to return
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest.
"
4,3,Romanian Official,"Protest?
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things.
"
4,3,All three men,"Oh.
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"But I want to assure you, and the Romanian people, that we are going to do everything in our power to make this as confusing as possible. 
"
4,3,Protesters,"Let the quints stay! Romania is gay! Let the quints stay! Romania is gay!
"
4,3,Stephen Stotch,"Fur is murder! Fur is murder!  Oh, what are we protesting here?
"
4,3,A Protester,"Romania sucks!
"
4,3,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, let's see  Here we go. Romania sucks!
"
4,3,Protesters,"Romania sucks! Romania sucks!
"
4,3,Sharon,"Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.
"
4,3,Randy,"That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.
"
4,3,Lead Agent Collins,"Attention, people inside the house!  You must return the quintuplets to their father! You have until...  Oh yeah, that's good.  You have until Easter Sunday to comply.
"
4,3,Protester,"Nooo!
"
4,3,Protesters,"Boooo!
"
4,3,Collins,"What?! 
"
4,3,Stan,"Okay, let's try it again. Hup!
"
4,3,A Quint,"Hup! 
"
4,3,Kyle,"Alright!
"
4,3,Randy,"Stan, we- 
"
4,3,Sharon,"Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania.
"
4,3,Stan,"No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
"
4,3,Kyle,"Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
"
4,3,Randy,"I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. 
"
4,3,Stan,"Now what do we do?
"
4,3,Reporter,"Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets. 
"
4,3,Soldier,"Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the plan.
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"Right.
"
4,3,Soldier,"We'll drop you on the northwest corner of the backyard. You hop into the back of the house and find the quintuplets. When you see them, you say...
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"""Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny.""
"
4,3,Soldier,"Good. And then hand them the Easter eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready?
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"Ready.
"
4,3,Soldier,"Code blue!
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"Code blue! 
"
4,3,Music Instructor,"Lad, we would like very much to have you here at the Romanian Music School.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
4,3,Mrs. McCormick,"How much is all this gonna cost?
"
4,3,Music Instructor,"Don't worry, Ms. McCormick, Romania is very poor country. Apartment is cheap. Food is cheap, Everything is cheap because we are so God-damned poor.
"
4,3,Assistant,"Yes, your two hundred American dollars will last months here.
"
4,3,Mrs. McCormick,"Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny.  Happy Easter, kids. Come see what I brought for ya. 
"
4,3,Phillip,"Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. 
"
4,3,Terrance,"Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb.
"
4,3,Quint 2,"Oh, look. An Easter egg.
"
4,3,Randy,"Oh, shi- 
"
4,3,Lead Soldier,"That's it. Let's move, move move move, move!  Give us the kids, now! Now!

4,3,Officer 1,"Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned floor!

4,3,Officer 2,"Find them!

4,3,Janet Reno,"This is a bust! Hand over the quints!  Hand over the children! Happy Easter. Hand over the children!!
"
4,3,Grandpa,"What the hell's goin' on?! 
"
4,3,Officer 3,"Freeze, asshole!
"
4,3,Grandpa,"Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya!
"
4,3,Officer 3,"Don't push me, man!
"
4,3,Grandpa,"Pull the trigger, you little pussy!
"
4,3,Officer 3,"Gaahhh! 
"
4,3,Officer 4,"Gun! Gun! 
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"Down! Down! 
"
4,3,Protester,"Riot! Riot!

4,3,Officer 5,"Pepper spray! Pepper spray! 
"
4,3,Officer 6,"Go ahead! In the van! 
"
4,3,Stan,"Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
"
4,3,Music Instructor,"Oh, your son is so talented, Ms. McCormick. The people of Romania love him.
"
4,3,Mrs. McCormick,"Good job, Kenny.
"
4,3,Music Instructor,"Mrs. McCormick, we would love for you and your son to stay here in Romania, with us. Will you consider it?
"
4,3,Mrs. McCormick,"Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Sure!)
"
4,3,Music Instructor,"Alright!
"
4,3,Sharon,"Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!
"
4,3,Cartman,"Dude, what the hell happened?
"
4,3,Stan,"The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
"
4,3,Kyle,"Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!
"
4,3,Stan,"Yeah! Well, not this time!
"
4,3,Cartman,"Huh?
"
4,3,Stan,"We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
"
4,3,Protester 1,"Hmm.
"
4,3,Protester 2,"Yeaahh.
"
4,3,Protester 3,"I don't know. I usually like to stop protesting by 5:30.
"
4,3,Protester 4,"Yeah, ah, do we get overtime for this?
"
4,3,Stan,"Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.
"
4,3,Protester 5,"Alright! 
"
4,3,Protester 6,"Yeah!
"
4,3,Protester 7,"Down with Japan! 
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"Alright. We just need to get a few more pictures of the girls reunited with their father so everyone knows they're happy. 
"
4,3,Photographer,"Come on, girls. Smile.  We want you to look happy. Smile.  Look at the silly frog. Who's got the silly frog? Look at him. I've got- Look at him. It's so silly. ""I'm so silly."" 
"
4,3,Stuart,"Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and-  Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much.  Man.
"
4,3,Stan,"Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
"
4,3,Soldier,"You can't see them, boys. They're happily reunited with their father.
"
4,3,Stan,"Come on, angry mob! 
"
4,3,Soldier,"Aaa-a-a-aaa-ah.
"
4,3,Romanian Official,"Alright, it is time for us to return to Romania.
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"What is that?
"
4,3,Officer 7,"It's the protesters. They're back.
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"God-damnit!  We'll take care of them. Come on!  
"
4,3,Officer 8,"Let's move. Move!
"
4,3,Officer 7,"Come on, come on, come on.
"
4,3,Officer 9,"Come oonn, come oonn. 
"
4,3,Officer 10,"This is government property!
"
4,3,Protester,"Let the quints stay! 
"
4,3,Sharon,"You ruined my house! 
"
4,3,Quint 1,"What are you doing, Nadia?
"
4,3,Nadia,"I'm calling the only person in the vorld who can help us. 
"
4,3,Cartman,"Take that! 
"
4,3,Quint 3,"Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! 
"
4,3,Quint 1,"All of you are acting like idiots!
"
4,3,Stan,"Yeah.
"
4,3,Quint 1,"None of you care about us. You only care about yourselves!
"
4,3,Quint 2,"Look at you, Father. You walked out on us five years ago , and now you act like you miss us sooo much! You are a liar and a fake!
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah, you suck, dude!
"
4,3,Quint 3,"And you Romanian leaders , you don't care about us! All you care about is making America look stupid!
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!
"
4,3,Quint 3,"And you protesters! Don't you have anything better to do?! Get a life!
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
4,3,Quint 3,"And you boys are the worst of all!
"
4,3,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","Huh?
"
4,3,Quint 3,"You know nothing about Romania, and yet you assume America is so much better! Maybe Romania isn't as nice as America, but it is our home! We are Romanian! All you care about is your own stupid circus! 
"
4,3,Janet Reno,"Where are you going, girls?
"
4,3,Quint 1,"The only place we can go. We're going on Oprah and then a book tour. 
"
4,3,Quint 5,"Yes. You can all kiss our little white Romanian asses! 
"
4,3,Stan,"Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah, screw them!
"
4,3,Kyle,"Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
"
4,3,Stan,"Whatever happened to Kenny?
"
4,3,Romanian Protesters,"Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! 
"
4,3,Officer 1,"Alright, people, the father wants his son returned to him! Hand him over to us!
"
4,3,Romanian Protesters,"Boooo!
"
4,3,Officer 2,"Shut up, Romanians! All right, let's go. Move move move move! 
"
4,3,Officer 3,"Hand over the boy, now!
"
4,3,Mrs. McCormick,"Okay, okay!
"
4,3,Officer 3,"I mean it, lady, you've got about-!  Whoops.
"
4,4,Stan,"Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
"
4,4,Stan,"I know!
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together?  Let's see, how about...
"
4,4,Cartman,"Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me.
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Wendy?
"
4,4,Cartman,"Phew!
"
4,4,Wendy,"1776.
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?
"
4,4,Cartman,"Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle?
"
4,4,Cartman,"Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
"
4,4,Kyle,"The Declaration of Independence?
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence?  Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy? 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"No, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Heh-aaaaaah!
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Timmy, did you not do your homework?!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Erh Timmiihh!!
"
4,4,Stan,"Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Don't call people names, Stanley!
"
4,4,Stan,"But he is-
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Now, Timmy,â€”
"
4,4,Timmy,"Haaaaah.
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"â€”You need to work on your study skills!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Doo-uhh.
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office!
"
4,4,Timmy,"G'oh livin' a lie, livin' a lie, Timmawh!
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"THAT DOES IT!
"
4,4,Principal Victoria,"Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Heh-aaaaaah!
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,4,Principal Victoria,"Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders! 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Ehhha-a-a-ah.
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal Victoria.  I think I may know what the problem is. 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh.
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"Yes, of course.
"
4,4,Principal Victoria,"What??
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, ""Attention Deficit Disorder,"" or ADD. It's very common in kids his age.
"
4,4,Principal Victoria,"Oh!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,4,Principal Victoria,"Well, that certainly would explain it.
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Oolih oo livin' a lie, Timmehuh!
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"Alright, this is a very simple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit Disorder.
"
4,4,Principal Victoria,"Good.
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you a book called, ""The Great Gatsby,"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I'll ask you a few questions. Are you ready?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"Okay, here we go.  ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since""  ""so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Ha-a-a-a-a-h.
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby drive?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"Well, that settles it!
"
4,4,"Mr. Mackey, Principal Victoria","Huh??
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder!
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh oh, I nuh-I knew it.
"
4,4,Principal Victoria,"What can we do for him, doctor?
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today. I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and we'll see how that goes for little Timmy.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Hurry up, children, let's take our seats.  You'd better have done your homework last night, Timmy.  What's this? 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Tim-mih.
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"A note from the principal? ""Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder.""  Oh, brother!
"
4,4,Stan,"He doesn't have to do homework?
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Very well, I guess you're excused from homework.
"
4,4,Kyle,"Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
"
4,4,Cartman,"Yeah, me too.
"
4,4,Stan,"I've got ADD.
"
4,4,Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
4,4,Other classmates,"Yeah, I've got it. Me too. Yeah. It's gay.
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"""After a while I went out and left the hospital, and walked back to the hotel in the rain.""  Alright now, in Chapter 12, what kind of bottles did Miss Van Campen talk about?  Anybody?  Anybody?? My God, these children all have ADD! 
"
4,4,All the kids,"Hooray.
"
4,4,Cartman,"Hoo-ray.
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"It's Ritalin for all of you! 
"
4,4,Drummer,"Dude, we suck!
"
4,4,Skyler,"Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!
"
4,4,Jonesy,"Dude, we never win the Battle of the Bands! It's no big deal.
"
4,4,Skyler,"Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?!
"
4,4,Mark,"Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting.
"
4,4,Skyler,"We've just gotta practice more.
"
4,4,Jonesy,"Dude, we've been practicing for eight years, Skyler.
"
4,4,Skyler,"Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top! 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmuuhh!  Coodalah Timmuh!
"
4,4,Jonesy,"What was that?
"
4,4,Skyler,"Huh-I don't know, man.  Whoaaa!
"
4,4,Mark,"Who is that?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,4,Skyler,"You a singer, man?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Rrrrr-laurlaurlah Timmehah!  Timmehuh!  Timmehh.
"
4,4,Jonesy,"Dude, that's hot!
"
4,4,Skyler,"Yeah!
"
4,4,Pharmacist,"There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick. A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin.
"
4,4,Mrs. McCormick,"And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?
"
4,4,Pharmacist,"We can only hope so. Next? 
"
4,4,Sharon,"Oh, hi, Sheila.
"
4,4,Sheila,"Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?
"
4,4,Sharon,"Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.
"
4,4,Sheila,"I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.
"
4,4,Kyle,"...I am eight.
"
4,4,Pharmacist,"Next, please?  What do we have here- ah! The Ritalin!
"
4,4,Liane,"Yes.
"
4,4,Cartman,"That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
"
4,4,Liane,"Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?
"
4,4,Pharmacist,"Oh, no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all.
"
4,4,Liane,"Alright.
"
4,4,Pharmacist,"Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected.
"
4,4,Liane,"Oh my.
"
4,4,Band,"Look alive, lettin' it feel (so light). Lettin' it feel so light.
"
4,4,People in Audience,"Boooo!
"
4,4,Guy in flat top,"You suck! 
"
4,4,M.C.,"Alright, that was ""Sisters of Mercy Hold No Pain Against the Dark Lord,"" with their song, ""Silk Blood On The Footsteps Of My Mind (Revisited)""
"
4,4,Singer,"We got the best response. We'll be opening for Phil Collins for sure.
"
4,4,M.C.,"And now it's time for our final band.
"
4,4,Guy in Audience,"Thank God! 
"
4,4,M.C.,"Give it up for ""Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld!"" 
"
4,4,Skyler,"1 2 3 4 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih!  Timmih! Lehmeheuh!  Timmih!
"
4,4,Man 1,"Duhude, that handicapped dude ruhules!
"
4,4,Man 2,"Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah!
"
4,4,Man 3,"You guys are terrible! How could you laugh at that poor kid?!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!
"
4,4,The Lords,"Lords of the Underworld.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih, Timmiih!
"
4,4,The Lords,"Darkness fills my heart with pain.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih oo livin' a lie! 
"
4,4,Stan,"Dude, it's Timmy.
"
4,4,Kyle,"No way! 
"
4,4,Man 3,"They're ridiculing that singer! Come on, let's get outta here! 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Sibilah Sibinlaahh! 
"
4,4,The Lords,"The Lords of the Underworld.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih, Timmih Timmitimmi Timmiih!
"
4,4,The Lords,"Darkness fills my heart with pain. 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmehahh! Timmeh Timmeh Sibinlah Timmih Sibinlah Timmih. Timmuh Timmuh Timmuh.  Timmeh!
"
4,4,Cartman,"That was awesuhome!
"
4,4,Stan,"Yeah, Timmy ruhules!
"
4,4,Woman,"Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!
"
4,4,Stan,"But he's funny.
"
4,4,Woman,"How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Hehaahh!
"
4,4,Stan,"He looks pretty happy to me.
"
4,4,Woman,"Oh, you people make me sick! 
"
4,4,M.C.,"Dude, this is a no-brainer. This year's Battle of the Bands winner and the band that gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalablala is... TIMMY!
"
4,4,Crowd,"Wooo!
"
4,4,Jonesy,"We did it, dude!
"
4,4,Skyler,"Listen to them. They really love me.  Wooo!!
"
4,4,Crowd,"Wooo!!
"
4,4,Skyler,"Yes! I'm a rocker! 
"
4,4,Charlie Rose,"Tonight, we analyze the new rock sensation, Timmeo , the controversial new band that has taken the country by storm.  Already playing at several large venues this month , the band prepares for its biggest gig, Lolapalooblaza, where they will open for Phil Collins. But Phil Collins is not happy.
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Well, I thinks it's a horrible tragedy, idn't it? I mean, people aren't gonna see Timmy for his musical skills. They're laughin' at 'im, and I think you shouldn't laugh at people with disabilities!
"
4,4,Man,"Hah haha.
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself!
"
4,4,Kyle,"Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?
"
4,4,Stan,"Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
"
4,4,Cartman,"Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?
"
4,4,Stan,"Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
"
4,4,Cartman,"No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good.
"
4,4,Kenny,"(Good.) 
"
4,4,Chef,"Hello there, children.
"
4,4,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","Hello, Chef.
"
4,4,Kenny,"(Hello, Chef.)
"
4,4,Chef,"How's it goin'?
"
4,4,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","Very well, thank you.
"
4,4,Kenny,"(Very well, thank you.)
"
4,4,Chef,"Everything's fine?? Why??
"
4,4,Stan,"Because we're on Ritalin.
"
4,4,Chef,"What??
"
4,4,Kyle,"We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
"
4,4,Cartman,"It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. 
"
4,4,Chef,"So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!
"
4,4,Kyle,"That's correct, Chef.
"
4,4,Chef,"Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
"
4,4,Stan,"Oh boy oh boy.
"
4,4,Kenny,"(Oh boy.)
"
4,4,Chef,"Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects.
"
4,4,Stan,"But there are no side effects, Chef.
"
4,4,Kyle,"No, not at all. 
"
4,4,Christina Aguilera monster,"Rown! 
"
4,4,Cartman,"Did you guys see that?
"
4,4,Stan,"See what?
"
4,4,Announcer,"You're watching MTV, the cool, brainwashing, twelve-year-old-and-younger station that hides behind a slick image. We're so cool that we decide what's cool. And now, MTV News, the news that is singlehandedly dumbing down our country. Which is cool. Here's your host, Kurt Loder.
"
4,4,Kurt Loder,"Why am I still doing this? I've got to be the oldest person in this network by at least 40 years.
"
4,4,Announcer,"Kurt Loder didn't just say that. No way, he did just say it, but just to be cool. That's what makes him cool. You think Kurt Loder is cool. And now, the news that's cool.
"
4,4,Kurt Loder,"Well, it's only two weeks until Lalapalalababa, and the headlining band has changed. Now headlining the event is Timmy , the new hit sensation out of Colorado. This news came as a shock to the performer that was going to headline Lalapalabala, Phil Collins.
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Well, I think the sad question is, ""Where are the parents in all this?"" I mean, that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited, and they don't even seem to care.
"
4,4,Kurt Loder,"And so, Phil Collins decided to travel to South Park and personally pay Timmy's parents a visit. 
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Well, I mean, why are you lettin' 'em do this to your son? Don't you see that everyone's just laughin' at him?
"
4,4,Richard,"Richarrrrd!
"
4,4,Helen,"Helennnn!
"
4,4,Richard,"'Oodleahah.
"
4,4,Kurt Loder,"Phil Collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should not be allowed to play Lalapalablalala, and vows to do everything in his power to stop it. Phil Collins, by the way, divorced his wife via fax and then married a 27-year-old. I'm Kurt Loder, and that's the news.
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's settle down!  Huhh I mean it; I want quiet!  My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin.  Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?!  Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex.  Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!
"
4,4,Cartman,"What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!
"
4,4,Kyle,"Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 
"
4,4,Cartman,"There you go. 
"
4,4,Christina Aguilera monster,"Rowr.
"
4,4,Cartman,"Whah!
"
4,4,A singer,"Thank you, South Park! Good night!
"
4,4,Jonesy,"Alright, let's rock this house! Hello Miami!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh! 
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Excuse me, Skyler Moles?
"
4,4,Skyler,"Yeah?
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Nice to meet you. I'm Phil Collins.
"
4,4,Skyler,"Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla.
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"I just wanted to tell you that, well, I think that you're a great guitar player and song writer.
"
4,4,Skyler,"Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run. 
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"It's too bad those other guys are holdin' you back.
"
4,4,Skyler,"Huh?
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you. Strange, how everyone focuses n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the name of the band is ""Timmy,""
"
4,4,Skyler,"Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. And all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back. But then, finally, I went solo. And that's when I started writing really great songs. But look, if you happen to be on the sidelines, you know, bein' more of a cheerleader than a player, well, then I guess you should stay on as Timmy's shadow.
"
4,4,Skyler,"Uh, thanks man. See ya.
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"That should just about put an end to all this Timmy nonsense. 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmuh! 
"
4,4,Jonesy,"Another great show, man. There must have been a hundred thousand people out there.
"
4,4,Skyler,"Yeah. All of them chanting ""Timmy, Timmy.""
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
4,4,Jonesy,"What's the matter, Skyler?
"
4,4,Skyler,"The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,4,Skyler,"And the Lords of the Underworld!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,4,Skyler,"It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!
"
4,4,Mark,"Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous.
"
4,4,Skyler,"Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm movin' on!  I don't need Timmy!  I'm goin' solo!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,4,Skyler,"No! Don't try and stop me, man!  I'll see you on fame's backside. 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Ooo livin' a lie!
"
4,4,Phillip,"Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?
"
4,4,Terrance,"Let me see. 
"
4,4,Phillip,"How do you like that, Terrance?
"
4,4,Stan,"Let's watch something else.
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yes, let's. 
"
4,4,Announcer,"You're watching VH1.
"
4,4,The Boys,"Ahhhh.
"
4,4,Anchor,"Here's Lalapalalala's news. The hit group Timmy has broken up.
"
4,4,Stan,"Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
"
4,4,Anchor,"And so, Phil Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler.
"
4,4,Kyle,"You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
"
4,4,Stan,"Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
"
4,4,Cartman,"I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
"
4,4,Stan,"Sounds good.
"
4,4,Cartman,"So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us.  Hooray.  Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. 
"
4,4,Stan,"Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.
"
4,4,Kyle,"Bastard.
"
4,4,Chef,"Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin. 
"
4,4,Randy,"Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.
"
4,4,Chef,"I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape. 
"
4,4,Dr. Shay,"Hello, I'm Dr. Richard Shay, here to tell you about my exciting new drug-free treatment for children with Attention Deficit Disorder.  This treatment is fast and effective and doesn't use harmful drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment to the first child.
"
4,4,Girl,"I want a horse. I want a big brown horse with a brown-and-black tail, and a diamond tiara-  Ah!
"
4,4,Dr. Shay,"Sit down and study! 
"
4,4,Boy 1,"Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go! 
"
4,4,Dr. Shay,"Sit down and study!
"
4,4,Boy 1,"Wwaaahahahahaaha 
"
4,4,Dr. Shay,"Stop crying and do your schoolwork!  If you would like more information on my bold new treatments, please send away for this free brochure, entitled, ""You can either calm down, or I can pop you in the mouth again."" Thank you. 
"
4,4,Chef,"Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.
"
4,4,Sharon,"That video had pretty colors.
"
4,4,Gerald,"It sure did.
"
4,4,Chef,"What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!
"
4,4,Parents,"Yes.
"
4,4,Chef,"Awww, fudge it! 
"
4,4,Stan,"Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
"
4,4,Chef,"The what?
"
4,4,Kyle,"Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.
"
4,4,Parents,"Yes.
"
4,4,Chef,"Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
"
4,4,Chef,"Oh my God!!
"
4,4,Kyle,"Come, see him with us.
"
4,4,Cartman,"Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again!  She's on my back! Hah! 
"
4,4,Chef,"That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!
"
4,4,Pharmacist,"Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points.
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"That's easily another twenty grand apiece! 
"
4,4,Chef,"Hey, open this damn door. 
"
4,4,Pharmacist,"Can I help you?
"
4,4,Chef,"Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit-
"
4,4,Chef,"I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"Huh?
"
4,4,Chef,"All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-
"
4,4,Chef,"You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!
"
4,4,Pharmacist,"Eh wuh, what?? 
"
4,4,Chef,"That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"Mm- my God. What have we done?? 
"
4,4,Pharmacist,"Well, if I had known... Phil Collins, uh, my God! 
"
4,4,Chef,"Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them.
"
4,4,Chef,"Then we need an antidote!
"
4,4,Pharmacist,"Yes, of course.
"
4,4,Clinic Doctor,"Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?
"
4,4,Pharmacist,"I have some right here.  It's a compound called ""Ritalout.""
"
4,4,Chef,"Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick! 
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Last night I went, ""O!""BubudioLast night I went ""Bubudio""
"
4,4,Chef,"Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children. 
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Last night I went, ""O!""Bububudio. 
"
4,4,Randy,"Wasn't that great, son?
"
4,4,Stan,"Sure was, Dad.
"
4,4,Gerald,"It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
"
4,4,Chef,"Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me. 
"
4,4,Stan,"Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. 
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"I know. I'd like to sing the complex and amazing song that won me the Oscar, a song entitled, ""You'll Be In... Me.""  Thanks.You're inside of me.Deep inside of me. So deep inside, I can feel you pushing against my heart.
"
4,4,Chef,"Come on, drink it down. It's free.
"
4,4,Cartman,"You'll be inside of me...
"
4,4,Christina Aguilera monster,"Rowr.
"
4,4,Cartman,"Huh? Oh no! Agh!  Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
"
4,4,Stan,"I feel... different.
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
4,4,Cartman,"Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh
"
4,4,Chef,"Drink this, Eric.  God help me! Heh, get it...  She's gone! Thank God!
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Well, thanks! 
"
4,4,Stan,"Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
"
4,4,Chef,"I think it's working.
"
4,4,Audience,"Booooo!!
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Shut your filthy holes, you little bastards!
"
4,4,Stan,"Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"You just wanna laugh at him.
"
4,4,Stan,"No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!
"
4,4,Audience,"Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!
"
4,4,Jonesy,"Man, it sucks not being part of Lalapalabala. 
"
4,4,Mark,"Yeah. 
"
4,4,Skyler,"Hey dudes. 
"
4,4,Jonesy,"Skyler, what are you doing here?!  Isn't Reach for the Skyler supposed to play soon? 
"
4,4,Skyler,"They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld. 
"
4,4,Mark,"Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again? 
"
4,4,Skyler,"I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head... 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
4,4,Jonesy,"Wow. They really are chanting for us. 
"
4,4,Mark,"Hn they want us back. 
"
4,4,Skyler,"What do you say, Timmy? 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Rrr, rrr, uh, Timmih. 
"
4,4,The Lords,"Alright!
"
4,4,Host,"Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, it is my pleasure to introduce the reunion tour of Timmehuh!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh, and the Lords of the Underworld!  Timmiihh!  Timmih! Livin' a lie-ah!  Hidilah Timmy!  Timmuh- Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!
"
4,4,The Lords,"And the Lords of the Underworld.
"
4,4,Phil Collins,"Put me down, you filthy bastards!  Awwww!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh uluh-livin' a lie!
"
4,5,A British Person,"Aaah.  Dickens. The imagery of cobblestone streets, cragging London buildings, and nutmeg-filled Yorkshire puddings.  Hello, I'm a British person. For years now, the character Pip has been featured prominently in the American show, South Park. However, many Americans don't realize where Pip came from. He's the prowling little adorable Englishman from Charles Dickens' timeless classic, ""Great Expectations""  And so tonight, the makers of South Park have agreed to take a break from their regular show, and instead present the prestigious Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end. Indeed, after watching this show, you'll know the timeless classic as if you'd... read the Cliff Notes themselves. Our story is set in England, in the small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot,  where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents.
"
4,5,Pip,"'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again.  Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together.  But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon.  Wa-a-ah!
"
4,5,Ex-Convict,"Wha' are you doin' 'ere, you little whippersham!
"
4,5,Pip,"Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison?  Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you. 
"
4,5,Ex-Convict,"Wha' are you doin' wit' those?
"
4,5,Pip,"I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  There you are.  And here's a sandwich. You must be starving! 
"
4,5,Ex-Convict,"Here. W-why are you easy to help me?
"
4,5,Pip,"Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.  Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid. 
"
4,5,Mrs. Joe,"Pip, where 'ave you been?!
"
4,5,Pip,"Waaah!  Lovely day, isn't it?
"
4,5,Mrs. Joe,"What the hell's lovely about it?!  Joe, teach this boy some bloody cynicism!
"
4,5,Joe,"I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing.  Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker. 
"
4,5,Mrs. Joe,"A lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while I'm starvin' to death! Why don't you make us some bloody food to eat!
"
4,5,Joe,"Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange. 
"
4,5,Mrs. Joe,"STOP your metal orange, you bastard! You never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale droppin's, you me'al-poundin' fairy!  And you! Why don't you ge' a job?! You're eight years old now!
"
4,5,Joe,"Oh, lookie heeah!  I've gone and made a metal newspaper!
"
4,5,Mrs. Joe,"Shut up, you silly lip! What are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper?
"
4,5,Joe,"Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position!
"
4,5,Mrs. Joe,"Where? 
"
4,5,Pip,"Where?
"
4,5,Mrs. Joe,"""Havisham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter. Will pay up to..."" TWENTY QUID A DAY??
"
4,5,Pip,"That's a lot of  money-loney.
"
4,5,Joe,"You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town. 
"
4,5,A British Person,"Well, the very next day, Pip went to Old Ms. Havisham's house to inquire about the job.  and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams.
"
4,5,Girl,"Who are you?! 
"
4,5,Pip,"...I've come to answer the want ad.
"
4,5,Girl,"Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!
"
4,5,Pip,"What??
"
4,5,Girl,"This way, you pathetic squirt of vaginal discharge!  This way, you beef-witted shriveled-up monkey's penis.  Up here, you gamy mass of baby vomit!  In here.
"
4,5,Pip,"Eho. After you, miss.
"
4,5,Girl,"I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine!
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Who is that?
"
4,5,Pip,"I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Come closer. Look at me.  Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years?
"
4,5,Pip,"Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"I sometimes have sick fancies.  And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play.
"
4,5,Pip,"Um. 
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Estella, play with this boy.
"
4,5,Estella,"With HIM?  But he's just a commoner!
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"But, you can break his heart.
"
4,5,Estella,"...Alright, boy, let us play.
"
4,5,Pip,"Righty-o. What are we going to play?
"
4,5,Estella,"We're going to play a little game called, ""Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log.""
"
4,5,Pip,"Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time!  Who will go first? 
"
4,5,Estella,"Oh, you stupid pathetic boy! 
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"What do you think of her?
"
4,5,Pip,"Well, uh... I think she's very pretty.
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Hm-m-m. What else?
"
4,5,Pip,"I think she's rather insulting.
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall ""play"" some more. 
"
4,5,A British Person,"That night, Pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get Estella's beautiful face out of his mind.
"
4,5,Dream Estella,"Stop dreaming about me, you slow-witted rectal belch!
"
4,5,A British Person,"Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk. But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew.
"
4,5,Pip,"Don't you wanna play anymore?
"
4,5,Estella,"Boy, do you still think I'm pretty? 
"
4,5,Pip,"Oho. Well, yes, miss.
"
4,5,Estella,"And, do you still think I'm insulting?
"
4,5,Pip,"Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!
"
4,5,Estella,"I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus!
"
4,5,Pip,"Oh, dear.
"
4,5,Estella,"You may kiss me if you like.  Come. Let us walk in the daisy garden. 
"
4,5,A Boy,"Oh, what fun it is to splash about in the fountain!  You there, the prowling little boy! I bet you can't jump on my back!  Go on, then. Try and jump on my back!
"
4,5,Pip,"Who is that?
"
4,5,Estella,"Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only one, did you?
"
4,5,Pip,"Oh I... rather thought I was.
"
4,5,Estella,"Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come, let us walk through the rose garden. 
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces.
"
4,5,A British Person,"Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella. And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps because she treated him like dirt, Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day.  Oh, bless him! Isn't he lovely??  But, isn't it sad? Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could never love him, for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice.
"
4,5,Joe,"And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it.  Your very own metal fuzzy dice.
"
4,5,Pip,"Yes. I see.  Hoh, lovely.
"
4,5,Joe,"Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?
"
4,5,Pip,"Joe, do you know anything about girls?
"
4,5,Joe,"Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.
"
4,5,Pip,"But, do you know anything about them? About how they work.
"
4,5,Joe,"Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'. 
"
4,5,Pip,"Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?
"
4,5,Joe,"Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip.  Who could that be? 
"
4,5,Lawyer,"Joe, the blacksmith?
"
4,5,Joe,"The same.
"
4,5,Lawyer,"I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip.
"
4,5,Pip,"I'm Pip, sir.
"
4,5,Lawyer,"Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice. 
"
4,5,Joe,"Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir.
"
4,5,Lawyer,"I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires.  Do you still object?
"
4,5,Joe,"Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but-
"
4,5,Lawyer,"He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman.
"
4,5,Joe,"That's great news! 
"
4,5,Lawyer,"There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous.
"
4,5,Pip,"Oho. But it must be Ms. Havisham!
"
4,5,Lawyer,"OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood?
"
4,5,Pip,"Yes sir.
"
4,5,Lawyer,"Then you will go to London in a week's time.  Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned.
"
4,5,Joe,"I am, sir.
"
4,5,Lawyer,"Then I should take my leave.  Good evening, gentlemen, and we shall see you in London next week, Pip. 
"
4,5,Pip,"Good-bye, sir.
"
4,5,Joe,"Pip!  A young gentleman! Of great expectations!
"
4,5,Lawyer,"You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this?
"
4,5,Pip,"None, sir.
"
4,5,Lawyer,"I should think not.  On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow.
"
4,5,Pip,"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. 
"
4,5,A Boy,"Mr. Pip? 
"
4,5,Pip,"Mr. Pocket?
"
4,5,Pocket,"Pray, come in! 
"
4,5,Pip,"Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar
"
4,5,Pocket,"As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth.  This is my little room - rather musty, and this is your bedroom. 
"
4,5,Pip,"My, how lovely.
"
4,5,Pocket,"Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them!  I'm quite ashamed!
"
4,5,Pip,"Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!
"
4,5,Pocket,"Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!
"
4,5,Pip,"Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed.
"
4,5,Pocket,"That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad!
"
4,5,Pip,"Well, what do you mean?
"
4,5,Pocket,"Well, don't you know about Ms. Havisham's melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come!  Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havisham.
"
4,5,Pip,"Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?
"
4,5,Pocket,"You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havisham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat.  And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth.
"
4,5,Pip,"Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry! 
"
4,5,Pocket,"Not at all, I'm sure.  Anyway, Ms. Havisham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip , to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler.
"
4,5,Pip,"Sorry! Sorry!
"
4,5,Pocket,"Not at all, I'm sure.  So this man pursued Ms. Havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her. She passionately loved him back. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came. But not the groom.  And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table!
"
4,5,Pip,"Oh. Excuse me.
"
4,5,Pocket,"Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding.
"
4,5,Pip,"At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.
"
4,5,Pocket,"But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table.
"
4,5,Pip,"Terribly sorry, Pocket.
"
4,5,Pocket,"Not at all, I'm sure!
"
4,5,A British Person,"And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havisham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella.
"
4,5,Pip,"Good evening, Ms. Havisham. 
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Come closer, Pip.  My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you?
"
4,5,Pip,"Thanks to you.
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well.  She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her? 
"
4,5,Pip,"Oh, my! She is even prettier than before. 
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?
"
4,5,Pip,"I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day.
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it.
"
4,5,Pip,"Righto.
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved.
"
4,5,Pip,"Yes, but... where will I find her?
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!
"
4,5,Pip,"Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything!  I'm the happiest boy in the land!
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper.  Lover her.
"
4,5,A British Person,"Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world.
"
4,5,Pip,"Hello, Estella.
"
4,5,Estella,"Pip.  My goodness, how you've changed!
"
4,5,Pip,"Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I? 
"
4,5,Estella,"I suppose.  So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance?
"
4,5,Pip,"Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.
"
4,5,Estella,"Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith?
"
4,5,Pip,"Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.
"
4,5,Estella,"Naturally. 
"
4,5,Pip,"It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.
"
4,5,Estella,"Is it? Why? 
"
4,5,Pip,"Because I believe I'm in love with you.
"
4,5,Estella,"Pip, you must know that I have no heart.
"
4,5,Pip,"I think you do.
"
4,5,Estella,"Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but  you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment.
"
4,5,Pip,"I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind.
"
4,5,Older Boy,"Hey, Estella, let's get out of here.
"
4,5,Estella,"Alright, Steve. Just one moment. 
"
4,5,Pip,"Who...? Who is that?
"
4,5,Estella,"That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car.
"
4,5,Pip,"I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?
"
4,5,Estella,"I should. He's my boyfriend.
"
4,5,Pip,"Boyfriend??
"
4,5,Estella,"What's the matter, Pip?!
"
4,5,Pip,"I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!
"
4,5,Estella,"It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip.  He's... seventeen and has a car. I'm... I'm... very  I'm  leaving. 
"
4,5,Pip,"Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a- 
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip. 
"
4,5,Pip,"Ms. Havisham! But um...
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip?  Look at the way he holds her hand.
"
4,5,Pip,"But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Things aren't always as they seem, Pip.  Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart?
"
4,5,Pip,"...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt.
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Yes. Tell me about the pain.  Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things.
"
4,5,Pip,"It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly.
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe.
"
4,5,Steve,"Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it.
"
4,5,Pip,"But why do you make your daughter hurt people?
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device.  You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation.
"
4,5,Steve,"What the hell??
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis platform. 
"
4,5,Steve,"Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm not lettin' you walk out on me!  What the?! 
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you! 
"
4,5,Joe,"Pip? Pip, old chap? 
"
4,5,Pip,"Joe?
"
4,5,Joe,"That's right. You're safe and warm now.
"
4,5,Pocket,"Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours.
"
4,5,Pip,"Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?
"
4,5,Joe,"Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you. 
"
4,5,Ex-Convict,"Allo, Pip. You remember me? 
"
4,5,Ex-Convict,"I'll rip off your arms and shove 'em up your arse!
"
4,5,Pip,"Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.
"
4,5,Ex-Convict,"Yes. After you helped me I moved to Wales and made somethin' o' myself. If it weren't for you, I'd have never become a millionaire.
"
4,5,Joe,"'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!
"
4,5,Pip,"You? But why?
"
4,5,Ex-Convict,"Because back then you treated me like any other person. You're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man.
"
4,5,Pip,"Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it. 
"
4,5,Pocket,"I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman, who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex.
"
4,5,Pip,"Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.
"
4,5,Pocket,"Righto. Pip. Righto.
"
4,5,Pip,"And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.
"
4,5,Joe,"What's that, Pip.
"
4,5,Pip,"If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!
"
4,5,Joe,"Yeah! 
"
4,5,A British Person,"And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, in which the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havisham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations!
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle?
"
4,5,Estella,"Yes, Mother. 
"
4,5,Pip,"Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch.
"
4,5,Estella,"Pip? 
"
4,5,Joe,"Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havisham!
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin.
"
4,5,Pocket,"Dear God, Pip, look! 
"
4,5,Steve,"Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend!
"
4,5,Boy,"So am I.
"
4,5,Man,"And me.
"
4,5,Man In Middle,"We were all Estella's boyfriends at one time or another. Now we're doomed.
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Yes. Cry away, males.  Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete.
"
4,5,Pip,"You won't get away with this!
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Won't I?  Let the transformation begin. 
"
4,5,Joe,"Pip, she started the device! 
"
4,5,Pip,"Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!
"
4,5,Pocket,"Righto, Pip. 
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"It begins.
"
4,5,Pip,"Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.
"
4,5,Estella,"It is... what I was raised for. 
"
4,5,Robot Monkey,"AAAAAAA!!!
"
4,5,Pocket,"Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havisham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid.
"
4,5,Man,"How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!
"
4,5,Pocket,"Yes, but just think about... panda bears!  Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda bears are.  What silly little noses they have!
"
4,5,Man,"Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct.
"
4,5,Pocket,"Oh, right, right, let's not think about panda bears, then. Let's think about ...swimming! Oh, what jolly fun swimming is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive. 
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"...Yes...
"
4,5,Ex-Convict,"Get out of that chair, you old cow! 
"
4,5,Pip,"Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart.
"
4,5,Estella,"I told you, Pip. I have no heart.
"
4,5,Pip,"But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny.
"
4,5,Estella,"Oh my. 'E's very cute.
"
4,5,Pip,"You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But look at this bunny.  There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.  ...Right.
"
4,5,Pocket,"Oh what fun it is to collect stamps! Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors.
"
4,5,Man,"My father died in a stamp-collecting accident.
"
4,5,Pocket,"Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about... 
"
4,5,Man In Middle,"Ice-skating!
"
4,5,Pocket,"Oh what fun ice-skating is!  Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me.
"
4,5,Joe,"Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!
"
4,5,Pip,"Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to-  Ten baby bunnies!
"
4,5,Joe,"...There's too many of them! 
"
4,5,Pocket,"Please, sirs, you must not cry!
"
4,5,Man,"We can't help it! You're bawlin' us to tears! 
"
4,5,Pocket,"Philip, it's too late!!
"
4,5,Pip,"Twenty-six baby bunnies
"
4,5,Estella,"I don't want to. I don't see the point in this.
"
4,5,Pip,"What?
"
4,5,Estella,"I don't want to kill any more of them.
"
4,5,Pip,"There! You see?! You do have a heart!
"
4,5,Estella,"You think so? Let me see it  Maybe I can kill it.
"
4,5,Pip,"No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now! 
"
4,5,Ms. Havisham,"Yessss!  Noooo! 
"
4,5,Pocket,"Ooooo, top smart, Pip! 
"
4,5,Joe,"You did it, Pip! 
"
4,5,Joe,"Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?
"
4,5,Estella,"Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over.
"
4,5,Pip,"You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!
"
4,5,Estella,"Yes! Yes, my small-testicled love! 
"
4,5,Pocket,"Oh, I'm so glad everything has worked out.  Where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then, Pip?
"
4,5,A British person,"And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Pocket, who died of hepatitis B.  So ends Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. We hope you now have a deeper appreciation for Pip, and indeed,  all masterpieces of literature like this one.  Until next time, I'm a British person. Good night.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card!  You can deny it, or cover it up.
"
4,6,Stan,"Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
"
4,6,Cartman,"It's ""Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis"" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up.
"
4,6,Stan,"Um, deny it?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. 
"
4,6,Electronic Head,"Hello, I'm Bill Kurtis. Many believe that the U.S. Government... covered it up. I'm Bill Kurtis.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.
"
4,6,Stan,"Sweet.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! 
"
4,6,Kyle,"What?
"
4,6,Cartman,"I just gave you AIDS.
"
4,6,Kyle,"AIDS?! 
"
4,6,Stan,"Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns  and 800 points. 
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?
"
4,6,Kenny,"(No.)
"
4,6,Stuart,"We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. 
"
4,6,Cartman,"God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.
"
4,6,Stan,"You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
"
4,6,Cartman,"...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
"
4,6,Kyle,"What?
"
4,6,Cartman,"I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here .
"
4,6,Kyle,"You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah!  â€” maybe a little mo down, down in hyah.  SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. 
"
4,6,Electronic Head,"I'm Bill Kurtis.
"
4,6,Cartman,"I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys""  That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li-  Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316.  Hi Tony.  ""So what are you into?""  Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face.  ""Kewl. Wanna get together?  Smiley-face?""  Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.  ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning.""  Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Hi, are you Tony? 
"
4,6,Tony,"Yeah. You're -Eric?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Yeah! 
"
4,6,Tony,"I brought you some candy.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Wow, cool!
"
4,6,Tony,"And some books on Kama Sutra.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.
"
4,6,Tony,"Yahahahah like having your back rubbed?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. 
"
4,6,Agent,"Hold it right there, scumbag!
"
4,6,Tony,"Huh?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Huh?
"
4,6,Agent,"We monitored your little online chat.  Now you're coming with us! 
"
4,6,Tony,"No! 
"
4,6,Cartman,"What the hell just happened?
"
4,6,Mom,"You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save food for the baby.
"
4,6,Dad,"Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby.
"
4,6,Mom,"Kenny, you have to change the baby's diapers!
"
4,6,Dad,"You have to share your room with the baby!
"
4,6,Mom,"The baby.
"
4,6,Dad,"The baby!
"
4,6,Mom,"The baby!!
"
4,6,Kenny,"(HAAAAAAAAGH!) 
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Stop it!
"
4,6,Stuart,"Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again.
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Oh, alright. 
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Dad, I wanna play catch.)
"
4,6,Stuart,"Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son.
"
4,6,Kenny,"(But I wanna play now!)
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.
"
4,6,Stuart,"Aw, alright.
"
4,6,Stuart,"Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it!  Good job. Now throw me one.  Ohp! Guhhogh! 
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"What happened?!
"
4,6,Stuart,"Aw, he smacked me in the balls! 
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Woohoo!) 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to-  Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy.  ""Hi. I'm eight and a half inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see, how about this one?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Mister Hammerhead?
"
4,6,Mr. Hammerhead,"Hi there.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison??
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Haah! Eric!
"
4,6,Cartman,"You wanna be my friend?
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, crap!
"
4,6,Cartman,"That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Huh-uh, nothing! Nothing! 
"
4,6,Agent,"Alright, scumbag, we got you!
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me.
"
4,6,Agent,"Nice try, buddy! We monitored your little online chatâ€”now, you're coming with us! 
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"No-o!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!
"
4,6,Kyle,"See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
"
4,6,Stan,"Oh, man, that's terrible.
"
4,6,Kyle,"I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 
"
4,6,Stan,"Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
"
4,6,Stan,"Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!
"
4,6,Stan,"We're making faces at sick people.
"
4,6,Cartman,"No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?! 
"
4,6,Stan,"We don't know.
"
4,6,Cartman,"I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
"
4,6,Kyle,"We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
"
4,6,Stan,"You're not more mature than us, Cartman!
"
4,6,Cartman,"YES I AM!! 
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady.
"
4,6,Officer Barbrady,"Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants.
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"O-ogh! 
"
4,6,Tony,"Do you like having your back rubbed?
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Eat me, pervert!
"
4,6,Tony,"Okay. 
"
4,6,Man,"We demand you release these men at once!
"
4,6,Officer Barbrady,"Who are you?
"
4,6,Man,"We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?
"
4,6,Officer Barbrady,"Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters.
"
4,6,Man,"Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!
"
4,6,Other NAMBLA Men,"Yeah, uh-huh.
"
4,6,Officer Barbrady,"Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI.
"
4,6,Man,"Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
"
4,6,Other NAMBLA Men,"Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
"
4,6,Officer Barbrady,"Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!
"
4,6,Man,"All these men wanted was to love a young boy!  There is nothing wrong with love!
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age.  Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!
"
4,6,Man,"You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong.  Come on, men! 
"
4,6,Officer Barbrady,"Wow, they've got activists for everything these days.
"
4,6,Dr. Mephesto,"I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese.  Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick-  Who could that be?  Why, it's little Eric Cartman.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Dr. Mephesto, I need help.
"
4,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Well of course, come in.
"
4,6,Cartman,"You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.
"
4,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
"
4,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA.
"
4,6,Cartman,"NAMBLA?
"
4,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! 
"
4,6,Dr. Mephesto,"Sure!
"
4,6,Man,"Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy.
"
4,6,Members,"Awwww.
"
4,6,NAMBLA leader,"And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and women's are protected under civil-rights laws,  we want the same!
"
4,6,Members,"Yeah.
"
4,6,Eager Man,"Yeh-hehah-hah.
"
4,6,NAMBLA leader,"What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a-  Can we... help you?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
"
4,6,NAMBLA leader,"You... do?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Sure.
"
4,6,NAMBLA leader,"Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus.
"
4,6,Cartman,"...Sweet.
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister.
"
4,6,Kenny,"(No!!) 
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Yup, it's for sure!
"
4,6,Stuart,"And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room. 
"
4,6,Kyle,"Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.
"
4,6,Stan,"Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
"
4,6,Kenny,"(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
"
4,6,Kyle,"What are you talking about, fatass?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! 
"
4,6,Pharmacist,"Can I help you, young lady?
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)
"
4,6,Pharmacist,"Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there. 
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Thanks.) 
"
4,6,Pharmacist,"Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't sell that to you without permission from your parents.  Oh, well, alrighty then. Cash or charge?
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Cash.)
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.) 
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me.
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Here.) 
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink.
"
4,6,Kenny,"(What?)
"
4,6,Stuart,"Well, I can still drink. 
"
4,6,Kenny,"(No! Daddy!) 
"
4,6,Stuart,"Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls.  What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of...  Who-o-oa.
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"What's the matter?
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Uh oh.)
"
4,6,Stuart,"Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants! 
"
4,6,Stuart,"Oohhh, God!  Oooh, my balls!  Ooh, God 
"
4,6,NAMBLA Member,"Just a few more pictures, Eric. You make a perfect poster child.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Thanks, dude. 
"
4,6,NAMBLA leader,"Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Really? Awesome!
"
4,6,NAMBLA leader,"Yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends. 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.
"
4,6,NAMBLA leader,"Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready.
"
4,6,Cartman,"KIIICK ASS!
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby. 
"
4,6,Announcer,"Hey, are you feeling down? You need some excitement. And North Park Funland has just opened its newest ride! The John Denver Experience!  You'll be Rocky Mountain High with this, the most EXTREME, INSANE RIDE EVER BUILT.
"
4,6,Two Guys,"It was-
"
4,6,Guy 1,"-fun.
"
4,6,Guy 2,"-fun.
"
4,6,Announcer,"Note: people with heart conditions and expectant mothers should not ride the JOHN DENVER! Open now! Come on down!
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Mom!) 
"
4,6,Stuart,"Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Oh, it's all right.  You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy. 
"
4,6,Operator,"Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride here at the John Denver Experience. Have fun.
"
4,6,Stuart,"What did he say?  ...John Denver Experience.
"
4,6,Stuart,"Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom.
"
4,6,Stuart,"Oh, I'm not gonna make it. I'm gonna be sick!  Oh, my stuhomach!  Oh, my nose!  Augh! 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
"
4,6,Kyle,"They are?
"
4,6,Cartman,"We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
"
4,6,Stan,"We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.
"
4,6,Kyle,"We don't wanna go!
"
4,6,Cartman,"You can't go.
"
4,6,Kyle,"We don't WANNA go!
"
4,6,Cartman,"No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out
"
4,6,Stan,"Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
"
4,6,Dr. Doctor,"You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick.  It's alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle of life. 
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Eeww.)
"
4,6,Dr. Doctor,"I can see its head!
"
4,6,Ms. McCormick,"You can?
"
4,6,Dr. Doctor,"Push, now. Push hard!  Oh my God. 
"
4,6,Ms. McCormick,"What is it?? 
"
4,6,Dr. Doctor,"It's ali- 
"
4,6,Stuart,"Oh my God, it killed Kenny!
"
4,6,Ms.McCormick,"Bad baby, bad!
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Huh. Huh??)  (That does it!) 
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'?  Uh what are you doing, Kenny?  Kenny, what are you going to plunge?
"
4,6,Kenny,"(AAAARRRRHHH!)
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Aaaaaaah!  AAAAA! 
"
4,6,Stuart,"Kenny, what the hell are you doing?! 
"
4,6,Cartman,"What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!
"
4,6,Stan,"We got invited too, fatass!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.
"
4,6,NAMBLA Leader,"Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us.
"
4,6,NAMBLA Member,"Oh, yeah. 
"
4,6,NAMBLA Leader,"First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you.
"
4,6,NAMBLA Leader,"Now, I know that many of us have already found partners in this fahine city, and I'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members.
"
4,6,Stan,"This is boring.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
"
4,6,Member 1,"Ho hohohoho
"
4,6,Member 2,"Woohoohoohoohoo. 
"
4,6,NAMBLA Leader,"Ho, goodness! What a gift from God! Aha ha, we'll... ""get"" ...to it very soon, I assure you. But first, I'd just like to hear from a couple of you on your progress. Uh yes, Patrick.
"
4,6,Patrick,"Uh I, I found a little eight-year-old named Buttehers. He's a beautiful , bright, little boy.
"
4,6,Butters,"Well, uh I sure am, I guess.
"
4,6,Patrick,"And his skin is as soft as fresh linen. 
"
4,6,Stan,"That seems kind of... weird.
"
4,6,Butters,"Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose.
"
4,6,NAMBLA Leader,"Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you, Mr. Harris?
"
4,6,Mr. Harris,"Well, I want to announce that I may have found the dream boy of the decade. He's sexy, sassy, and full of spunk. His name is Timmy.
"
4,6,Timmy,"TIMMMIHH, tih, Timmih?
"
4,6,NAMBLA Leader,"Wuhell, members, I know we're all eager to get acquainted with our new partners and, so why don't we turn down the lights and start to dance!

"
4,6,Mephesto,"Yes.

4,6,Lead Agent,"The North American Man/Boy Love Association?
"
4,6,Mephesto,"What? No!  We're the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes. 
"
4,6,Blond Agent,"Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA.
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place. 
"
4,6,Mephesto,"Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?!
"
4,6,Lead Agent,"You know of them?
"
4,6,Blond Member,"Know of them? We've been fighting with them for years over the rights to nambla.com!
"
4,6,Brunet Member,"Yeah, those perverted bastards!
"
4,6,Blond Agent,"Wow. You guys really do look a lot like Marlon Brando.

4,6,Member 3,"All right.
"
4,6,Member 4,"Alright.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Dude. Being mature is boring!
"
4,6,Stan,"Yeah.

4,6,Waiter,"Sacre bleu.

4,6,Kyle,"Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
"
4,6,Cartman,"They're all over the place.

4,6,Token,"What are we gonna do?!
"
4,6,Stan,"Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
"
4,6,The Boys,"Yeah.

4,6,Cartman,"Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
"
4,6,Kyle,"How?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. 
"
4,6,Butters,"Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Now, are you a team player or not?!
"
4,6,Butters,"Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team.""
"
4,6,Butters,"Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
"
4,6,Butters,"Well uuh-uuh-alright then. 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
"
4,6,Butters,"Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team. 
"
4,6,Stuart,"Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans! 
"
4,6,NAMBLA Leader,"Oh, one of the boys just came in. 
"
4,6,Stuart,"What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! 
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Are you alright, Stuart?
"
4,6,Stuart,"Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old menâ€”I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath! 
"
4,6,Lead Agent,"We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights?
"
4,6,NAMBLA Leader,"Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today.  Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called ""freedom."" They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live.  You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand. 
"
4,6,Kyle,"Dude. You have sex with children.
"
4,6,NAMBLA Leader,"We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away. 
"
4,6,Kyle,"Dude. You have sex with children.
"
4,6,Stan,"Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Seriously.
"
4,6,Lead Agent,"Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time. 
"
4,6,Kyle,"Well, Cartman
"
4,6,Cartman,"Well, what?
"
4,6,Kyle,"Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
"
4,6,The Boys,"Yeah!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
"
4,6,Stan,"And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
"
4,6,Cartman,"No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. 
"
4,6,Paramedic,"Okay, let's roll. 
"
4,6,Nurse,"Dr. Flores, dial 18-
"
4,6,Stuart,"Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo.
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Our little angel, yes.
"
4,6,Stuart,"Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. 
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"What should we name him?
"
4,6,Stuart,"Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)
"
4,6,Stuart,"God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.
"
4,6,Mrs. McCormick,"Fifty-second.
"
4,7,Mr. Wyland,"Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland. 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.
"
4,7,Mr. Wyland,"Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers.  But if we all behave and respect each other, I'm sure we can make this a fun and productive day. Let's start with roll call. Let's see, mmmmm.  Eric Cartman?
"
4,7,Stan,"Here! 
"
4,7,Mr. Wyland,"Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Here.) 
"
4,7,Wendy,"It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus.
"
4,7,Mr. Wyland,"Okay, and where iiiissâ€¦ Kenny McCormick?
"
4,7,Cartman,"Here.  Oh, hoho. Ow.
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, what the hell was that?
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
"
4,7,Stan,"...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Huh?
"
4,7,Stan,"You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Not with me, man.
"
4,7,Mr. Wyland,"Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today.  I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days â€” Kyle Broflovski?
"
4,7,Stan,"He's fakin'!
"
4,7,Mr. Wyland,"Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it.
"
4,7,The Class,"Awww. 
"
4,7,Cartman,"He's fakin'! 
"
4,7,Mr. Wyland,"Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too.
"
4,7,Cartman,"But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
"
4,7,Mr. Wyland,"I don't care! Get down here and do it!
"
4,7,Butters,"Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'? 
"
4,7,Stan,"Now, that's a get-well card! 
"
4,7,Chairman,"Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"What??
"
4,7,Board Member,"Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting. 
"
4,7,Chairman,"Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was?
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!
"
4,7,Chairman,"...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about.  It's your somewhat substantial police record.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, whatever!
"
4,7,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! 
"
4,7,Board Member,"All we're saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little  ""child molestation"" thing dies down a bit.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.
"
4,7,Chairman,"We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore.  I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun... 
"
4,7,Chairman,"Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?
"
4,7,Sheila,"Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.
"
4,7,Sharon,"Hello, sweetie. 
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?
"
4,7,Sheila,"They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.
"
4,7,Sharon,"Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look. 
"
4,7,Stan,"Go on, Butters!
"
4,7,Butters,"Ho, I don't wanna!
"
4,7,Stan,"Butters, go on!
"
4,7,Butters,"Oh, uhuh alright, then. 
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, ""Get well soon!""
And ""Please don't die on us.""
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, you really are sick, huh?
"
4,7,Kyle,"I don't know, I...
"
4,7,Sheila,"I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.
"
4,7,Sharon,"Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.
"
4,7,Sheila,"Really? In People?
"
4,7,Sharon,"There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named ""Miss Information.""
"
4,7,Sheila,"Oh, well, with a name like ""Miss Information"" she must know something.
"
4,7,Sharon,"Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.
"
4,7,Sheila,"Okay. I'll get our coats. 
"
4,7,Butters,"Can I go now?
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know.
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"I've always wanted to write a novel.
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well, there you go, m'kay?
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"But I never know what to write about.
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Besides teaching?
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"Yes.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"...Poontang.
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"M, m'kay
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Yes, that's it.  I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!
"
4,7,Miss Information,"You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins.
"
4,7,Sheila,"Toxins?
"
4,7,Miss Information,"All the horrible food we eatâ€”the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper.
"
4,7,Sharon,"Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!
"
4,7,Sheila,"You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all. 
"
4,7,Stan,"Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
"
4,7,Miss Information,"What?
"
4,7,Stan,"Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
"
4,7,Sharon,"Don't be a smartass, Stanley.
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans.
"
4,7,Sharon,"Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. 
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts
Oh yeah, now this is getting good 
Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard.
His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his
penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples
Uh, let's see...  Diana's nipples...  Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck.  Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat.
"
4,7,Mrs. Tweak,"Oh my, he looks terrible.
"
4,7,Blonde Mother,"Yes, poor little dear.
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Good morning, everyone.
"
4,7,Blonde Mother,"Oh, thanks for coming, Miss. Information. Kyle seems to be getting worse. 
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Huuuuuuuuuh  Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better.
"
4,7,Sheila,"Really?
"
4,7,Stan,"What?
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter.
"
4,7,Sharon,"Oh, that's great news! 
"
4,7,Sheila,"Oh no!
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system.
"
4,7,Sharon,"Ooooo.
"
4,7,Stan,"Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
"
4,7,Sharon,"Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!
"
4,7,Stan,"Don't be a smartass?
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!
"
4,7,Sheila,"Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.
"
4,7,Other mothers,"I agree. Yeah. That's right. 
"
4,7,Nurse,"Mr. Marsh is here to see you.
"
4,7,Dr. Doctor,"Alright, send him in.  Oh, Stanley.
"
4,7,Stan,"Hi, doctor. 
"
4,7,Dr. Doctor,"How can I help you?
"
4,7,Stan,"Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
"
4,7,Dr. Doctor,"He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine.
"
4,7,Stan,"But I don't think it's working.
"
4,7,Dr. Doctor,"Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die.
"
4,7,Stan,"Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
"
4,7,Dr. Doctor,"I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn.
"
4,7,Stan,"...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
"
4,7,Dr. Doctor,"That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact,  there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle.
"
4,7,Stan,"Who?  Oh, shit.
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.) 
"
4,7,Cartman,"""Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.
"
4,7,Kenny,"(No, no.)
"
4,7,Cartman,"Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!)  (There! It's mine!) 
"
4,7,Cartman,"No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow! 
"
4,7,Liane,"Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?
"
4,7,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
4,7,Liane,"Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Okay, mom.
"
4,7,Liane,"And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. 
"
4,7,Cartman,"What's goin' on, guys?
"
4,7,Stan,"Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oh-kay.
"
4,7,Stan,"Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Uh huh.
"
4,7,Stan,"What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oh, I think I see where this is going. 
"
4,7,Stan,"His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
"
4,7,Stan,"Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
"
4,7,Cartman,"No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!
"
4,7,Stan,"But you only need one, fat boy!
"
4,7,Cartman,"No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!
"
4,7,Kenny,"(It's not that's fucking serious.) 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.
"
4,7,Stan,"Oh my God!
"
4,7,Kyle,"How much?
"
4,7,Cartman,"I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?
"
4,7,Stan,"Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
"
4,7,Cartman,"Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Ten million dollars??)
"
4,7,Stan,"What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
"
4,7,Cartman,"What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
"
4,7,Stan,"Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!
"
4,7,Man 1,"Ooo, free-range aspirin!
"
4,7,Man 2,"All-natural cell phones! 
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Oh, look everyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez. 
"
4,7,Man 3,"Ooo.
"
4,7,Man 4,"I'd like to buy some more stuff.
"
4,7,Man 5,"Come in. Come here, guys.
"
4,7,Man 6,"Do you have any new holistic items for sale?
"
4,7,Carlos Ramirez,"Oohh, oh yeah. Aah...  Here, uh, this is a- uhh, dream...catcher.
"
4,7,Woman 1,"Oh, a dreamcatcher. I'll buy one. 
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto,"Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair tampons. They're, like, tampons made with all-natural hair from the Cherokee people.
"
4,7,Sharon,"Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hairâ€”now that sounds natural.
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto,"Oh yeah. We love the earth, man.
"
4,7,Carlos Ramirez,"Oh yeah, the earth is great.
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto,"Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll give him, like, a, a brain enema, or somethin'.
"
4,7,Carlos Ramirez,"uh'hm, ho ho hm.
"
4,7,Sheila,"Wonderful!
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit. 
"
4,7,Man 7,"D'you have anymore stuff to sell? We wanna buy more stuff.
"
4,7,Man 8,"Yes. Much, much more stuff.
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto,"Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab some more junk.  Come on. 
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you.
"
4,7,Carlos Ramirez,"Oh yah. You too and junk. 
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto,"That's funny, man. 
"
4,7,Sharon,"Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste.
"
4,7,Stan,"You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
"
4,7,Sharon,"That's right.
"
4,7,Stan,"Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic medicine is about NATURE.  Two-hundred and thirty-three dollars. 
"
4,7,Sheila,"Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.
"
4,7,Stan,"Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
"
4,7,Sharon,"You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!
"
4,7,Stan,"And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
"
4,7,Sharon,"Enough, Stanley!
"
4,7,Stan,"Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.
"
4,7,Kenny,"(I know.)
"
4,7,Stan,"I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Uh huh.)
"
4,7,Stan,"I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! 
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Rrrh!)
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Chapter 18.
Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized about.
Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up!
And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help but feel aroused.  ""Go on"", Rebecca said softly, ""Touch me."" Diana leaned down slowly and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood forest of penises.
They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with...
Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?!  Oh, Mr. Hat!
"
4,7,Stan,"Come on, where are they? 
"
4,7,Stan,"This is it??
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Uh huh)
"
4,7,Timmy,"Timmiiihh!
"
4,7,Stan,"This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
"
4,7,Butters,"Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.
"
4,7,Stan,"Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
"
4,7,Butters,"Huh, where are we goin'?
"
4,7,Stan,"We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. 
"
4,7,Daughter,"Mom... Do you ever have those heavy flow days?
"
4,7,Mother,"Oh absolutely sweetheart, everybody does.
"
4,7,Daughter,"Mom, remember the movie The Shining where the elevator doors are opening up..
"
4,7,Mother,"Oh honey what you need is a more absorbent tampon. 
"
4,7,Daughter,"Like what?
"
4,7,Mother,"Well, what's the most absorbent thing in the world?
"
4,7,Daughter,"Well... Cherokee hair I guess.   But what does that have to do with me?
"
4,7,Mother,"Because now there is all new, natural 
Cherokee hair tampons. 
.
"
4,7,Female announcer,"A cotton tampon can hold only so much liquid. 
Other tampons also come up short. 
But Cherokee hair has been known for ages to be strong and powerful 
Each tampon is hand woven 
from over 200 strands of Cherokee hair and then bound together with these decorative native beads.
"
4,7,Daughter,"You were right mom! All natural Cherokee hair tampons really did the trick. 
"
4,7,Mother,"And when you're done using them  they make a great toy for Jessie.  Go get it boy! 
"
4,7,Jessie,"Grrr... grrrr
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto (Tommy Chong in his stoner voice),"Let the wonders and the mysteries of our people, like, change the way you think about tampons.
"
4,7,Cartman,"No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
"
4,7,Stan,"Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
"
4,7,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,7,Stan,"Sshhh!
"
4,7,Timmy,"Timmiihh.
"
4,7,Stan,"If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Okay)
"
4,7,Timmy,"Timmiihh.
"
4,7,Stan,"Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!
"
4,7,Butters,"Oh well, we're busted. 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Shut up, Fluffy! 
"
4,7,Stan,"Oh, phew.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! 
"
4,7,Stan,"Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
"
4,7,Butters,"I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
"
4,7,Stan,"...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
"
4,7,Cartman,"whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!
"
4,7,Stan,"You suck, Cartman!
"
4,7,Cartman,"Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!
"
4,7,Stan,"God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
"
4,7,Cartman,"I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care. 
"
4,7,Publisher,"First and foremost, Mr. Garrison, I would like to thank you for choosing Harequin Romance.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Yeahyeahyeah. So, did you read the book?
"
4,7,Publisher,"Uh yes, Mr. Garrison, we did read your book. 
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well, what did you think?
"
4,7,Publisher,"Well, uh, frankly, Mr. Garrison, n-we don't know if the Harequin Romance label is appropriate for you.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Ooohhh, why not??
"
4,7,Publisher,"Mr. Garrison, uh... are you aware that the word ""penis"" occurs six-thousand and eighty-three times in your novel?
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel.
"
4,7,Publisher,"Nnnno, I don't think that this book really qualifies as a ""romance novel.""
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"No?
"
4,7,Publisher,"No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call... gay. Really, really gay.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell are you talkin' about?!
"
4,7,Publisher,"It's just that the focus really seems to be on the... male organs.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!
"
4,7,Publisher,"It is.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs!  Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!
"
4,7,Publisher,"Hmmm.
"
4,7,Stan,"There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
"
4,7,Kenny,"(You never seem to care when I die!)
"
4,7,Stan,"My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... 
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!) 
"
4,7,Mover,"Look out!  Oops.
"
4,7,Stan,"Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! 
"
4,7,Mrs.Tucker,"Four dozen Cherokee hair tampons, please.
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto,"No problem, man. Pay Miss Information up front. 
"
4,7,Man 7,"Hi, uh, I have a little bit of pain in my balls whenever I watch VH1.
"
4,7,Carlos Ramirez,"Oh, here, try this, man. Ah, this is allll-naturalll ball juice. 
"
4,7,Man 7,"Wow, I feel better already! 
"
4,7,Miss Information,"And next we have Mrs. Broflovski's son. 
"
4,7,Sheila,"Okay, here he is.
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto,"Ahahem, that kid looks really sick.
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again.
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto,"No. I mean, he looks REALLY sick, man. You should take him to, like, a doctor.
"
4,7,Customers,"Hmm?
"
4,7,Sheila,"But you're more in touch with the earth.
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto,"Look, bein' in touch with the earth has nothing to do with dyin', man.
"
4,7,Sharon,"It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing. 
"
4,7,Carlos Ramirez,"No, man, that kid needs a doctor! And besides, we're not actually Native Americans. I mean, I'm- I'm more like a- a Mexican.
"
4,7,Customers,"What?!
"
4,7,Man,"Hu-uh?!
"
4,7,Carlos Ramirez,"Yeah. A Mexican.
"
4,7,Man 7,"Uugh.  Ptu, ptu.
"
4,7,Man 8,"I didn't know that.
"
4,7,Gerald,"Oh my God!
"
4,7,Sharon,"How dare you deceive us like that!
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto,"Hey, we never said we were Native Americans, man. Miss Information said that.
"
4,7,Carlos Ramirez,"Yeah. She said nobody would buy anything from Mexicans. 
"
4,7,Miss Information,"Uh, toxins are your enemy. 
"
4,7,Woman 1,"Kill her! 
"
4,7,Carlos Ramirez,"Funny.
"
4,7,Stan,"So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
"
4,7,Sheila,"Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!
"
4,7,Stan,"That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!
"
4,7,Cartman,"Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, please. Kyle needs it.
"
4,7,Cartman,"It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!
"
4,7,Stan,"Alright, alright, here. 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.
"
4,7,Nurse,"Doctor, Eric Cartman is here- 
"
4,7,Dr. Doctor,"Why, hello there, Eric. 
"
4,7,Cartman,"You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please.
"
4,7,Dr. Doctor,"Oh, I see.  Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?
"
4,7,Cartman,"No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
"
4,7,Dr. Doctor,"Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery.  If you'll just sign this release. 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Thank you. 
"
4,7,Sheila,"How are you feeling, boubbie?
"
4,7,Kyle,"Better, thanks.
"
4,7,Stan,"You look a lot better.
"
4,7,Sharon,"Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick.
"
4,7,Kyle,"Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
"
4,7,Chief Running Pinto,"Yeah.  Hey, man, we're glad you're getting better, too.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Heh. Hey, what what's going on?
"
4,7,Stan,"Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!
"
4,7,Cartman,"Huh?
"
4,7,Stan,"It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
"
4,7,Dr. Doctor,"Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release.
"
4,7,Liane,"Isn't that funny, sweetie?
"
4,7,Cartman,"Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, here's everybody. 
"
4,7,Stan,"Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present. 
"
4,7,Kyle,"Oh. ...Thanks?
"
4,7,Cartman,"I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
"
4,7,Stan,"Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. 
"
4,7,Kyle,"Huh?  What the?
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.
"
4,8,Mayor,"Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Mayor, it's about the South Park flag.
"
4,8,Mayor,"Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!
"
4,8,Jimbo,"We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!
"
4,8,Chef,"Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!
"
4,8,Chef,"That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!
"
4,8,Mayor,"Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.  and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it. 
"
4,8,Chef,"You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?
"
4,8,Chef,"Yeah!
"
4,8,Jimbo,"No, because it's their history!
"
4,8,Chef,"Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!
"
4,8,Jimbo,"And I'm telling you it WON'T!
"
4,8,Mayor,"Oh, boy.
"
4,8,Mr. Wyland,"Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club.
"
4,8,Class,"Aaaaah!
"
4,8,Mr. Wyland,"I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year.  Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has beenâ€¦ Cartman.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Thaaat's ri-ight.
"
4,8,Kyle,"Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
"
4,8,Class,"Yeah.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
"
4,8,Stan,"You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
"
4,8,Cartman,"Yes I do!
"
4,8,Craig,"No you don't!
"
4,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
4,8,Kyle,"Told ya.
"
4,8,Mr. Wyland,"Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, I want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on. 
"
4,8,Jimbo,"This is about history, kids.  If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD!  -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not  ""politically correct."" Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL!  And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?
"
4,8,Ned,"Nnneh, in 1867, fourteen pioneers from the East Coast traveled across the Plains-
"
4,8,Stan,"Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
"
4,8,Kyle,"Yeah, we got it.
"
4,8,Jimbo,"You sure?
"
4,8,"Stan, Kyle","Yup.
"
4,8,Jimbo,"You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson!  God-damnit, we missed him again!
"
4,8,Chef,"Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag!  You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved!  Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?
"
4,8,Randy,"Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.
"
4,8,Chef,"Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion.  That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!
"
4,8,Wendy,"We'll march with you, Chef.
"
4,8,Chef,"That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?
"
4,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon.
"
4,8,Chef,"Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?
"
4,8,Principal Victoria,"Thursday's no good, we've got choir council.
"
4,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, yeah.
"
4,8,Principal Victoria,"What about next Sunday?
"
4,8,Chef,"Fine! Next Sunday!
"
4,8,Man 1,"You mean, during the ball game?
"
4,8,Man 2,"Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday.
"
4,8,Chef,"Monday??
"
4,8,Principal Victoria,"Oh, I can't do Monday.
"
4,8,Man 3,"I could do Tuesday.
"
4,8,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, Tuesday morning's good.
"
4,8,Man 1,"You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.
"
4,8,Man 2,"Saturday is perfect for me.
"
4,8,Principal Victoria,"Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?
"
4,8,Man 3,"Mm hmm.
"
4,8,"Man 2, Woman 2","Yeah.
"
4,8,Man 1,"Yeah.
"
4,8,Man 3,"That sounds good.
"
4,8,Man 2,"Mm hmm.
"
4,8,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, I think that's the best day.
"
4,8,Chef,"Okay! On Saturday, we march!
"
4,8,Man 2,"Oh, march? What are we marching for?
"
4,8,Chef,"To bring down the South Park Flag!
"
4,8,Man 2,"â€¦Oh. 
"
4,8,Man 3,"Oohh, I gotta go.
"
4,8,Man 1,"I know what I may like. I don't like marching
"
4,8,Woman 2,"Uh, marching's really not for me.
"
4,8,Man 2,"See you later.
"
4,8,Mr. Wyland,"Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, children, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay, and half think the flag should be changed.
"
4,8,Wendy,"How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!
"
4,8,Mr. Wyland,"Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the ""Flag Should Stay The Way It Is"" team?
"
4,8,"Stan, Kyle","Me. Me. Me. Me.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!
"
4,8,Stan,"Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 
"
4,8,Kyle,"Yeah, me neither.
"
4,8,Mr. Wyland,"Alright. Stan and Kyle,  you can both be the team leaders for the ""Flag should stay the way it is"" team.  Now, who wants to lead the ""Flag should be changed"" team?  Okay, Wendy and Eric can team up. 
"
4,8,Wendy,"Nooo! 
"
4,8,Mr. Wyland,"Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate!
"
4,8,"Stan, Kyle","Hello, Chef.
"
4,8,Chef,"My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam.
"
4,8,Stan,"Islam??
"
4,8,Chef,"From now on, my name is  Abdul Mohammed Jabar  Rauf Kareem Ali.  With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!
"
4,8,Stan,"Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
"
4,8,Chef,"You WHAT?!  You don't think they should change the flag?!
"
4,8,Kyle,"Not really.
"
4,8,Stan,"Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
"
4,8,Chef,"Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!
"
4,8,Stan,"But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
"
4,8,Chef,"But nothin'!  ""But"" my ass! Fix your own damn food! 
"
4,8,Wendy,"Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-
"
4,8,Cartman,"It's okay, I'm here.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.
"
4,8,Wendy,"What??
"
4,8,Cartman,"That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
"
4,8,Butters,"Wwuhuh-o-kay! 
"
4,8,Cartman,"The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
"
4,8,Clyde,"Right. 
"
4,8,Cartman,"Mmmm.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate.
"
4,8,Cartman,"You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
"
4,8,Wendy,"The South Park flag!
"
4,8,Cartman,"Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?
"
4,8,Wendy,"D'aaaaahhh!
"
4,8,Cartman,"Whoa! Calm down, ho. 
"
4,8,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing out front of the South Park Mayor's Office, where both sides of this debate have gathered.
"
4,8,Chef,"Change the flag!
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Don't change history!
"
4,8,Mayor,"Oh brother, what now?!
"
4,8,Chef,"Change the flag! Change the flag!â€¦
"
4,8,Reporter,"Earlier, the South Park townspeople voiced their opinion.
"
4,8,Man 4,"Well, I think the flag is racist!  Huh, but then again, it is part of our history.
"
4,8,Man 5,"Well, I guess the flag is part of history, â€¦but I can see how it is racist.
"
4,8,Man 6,"I think it is history. I think it is racist.
"
4,8,Reporter,"Well, one things for sure, tensions are high and pressure is mounting on the South Park Mayor to do something.
"
4,8,Chef,"â€¦Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag!  In the 1960s there was a monk  who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice!  To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing! 
"
4,8,Monk,"Huh! Haaaaaaaaaaaah! 
"
4,8,The KKK,"White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
"
4,8,Reporter,"What's this? Uh, Tom, it looks as if the KKK have shown up to express their opinion.
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"Hello, brother.  We are here to support your noble cause.
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history.
"
4,8,Ned,"Yeah.
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"Well, whether you want our support or not, we're on your side! 
"
4,8,The KKK,"White Power! White Power!  White Power! White Power!  White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
"
4,8,Sheila,"Mr. Garrison, you're a Klan member?
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"NO, no,  but Mr. Hat is. 
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"White Power! White Power!
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat.
"
4,8,The KKK,"White Power!
"
4,8,Chef,"Change the flag!
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Don't change history!
"
4,8,Mayor,"Ooh, Jesus. What a mess.
"
4,8,Mayor,"Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case.  We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen?  There. Is that better? 
"
4,8,Chef,"No, damnit!
"
4,8,Mayor,"No, but look! He's got a little smile now!  See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think?  Well, some people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?
"
4,8,Johnson,"Mayor, the-ee South Park Elementary children are discussing the flag issue in their debate club on Friday.
"
4,8,Assistant,"Weâ€¦ could use the debate as an excuse to hold a vote on the issue.
"
4,8,Mayor,"Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!
"
4,8,Wendy,"This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-
"
4,8,Cartman,"I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!
"
4,8,Wendy,"If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-
"
4,8,Cartman,"Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!
"
4,8,Wendy,"Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!
"
4,8,Cartman,"You won't let me help.
"
4,8,Wendy,"That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!
"
4,8,Cartman,"â€¦TouchÃ©. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, justâ€¦ tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.
"
4,8,Kyle,"Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 
"
4,8,Stan,"Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
"
4,8,Kyle,"Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!
"
4,8,Kenny,"(Plenty. This is 'cause my family's poor.)
"
4,8,Kyle,"I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
"
4,8,Kenny,"(Ah, fuck you!) 
"
4,8,Stan,"I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
"
4,8,Kyle,"Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.
"
4,8,Kenny,"(Hey, can I have a drink of water?)
"
4,8,Kyle,"Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. 
"
4,8,Stan,"Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. 
"
4,8,Gerald,"Hey, boys, how's the research coming?
"
4,8,Kyle,"Pretty good, I guess.
"
4,8,Stan,"Do you think they should change the flag?
"
4,8,Gerald,"Oh, uuhh. I don't know. 
"
4,8,Kyle,"Kenny ate all the mints, dad.
"
4,8,Gerald,"Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.
"
4,8,Kyle,"Oh.
"
4,8,"Stan, Kyle","Kenny! 
"
4,8,Kenny,"(What?)  (Oh oooooooOOOOOOOH!) 
"
4,8,Stan,"That was a good one.
"
4,8,The KKK,"White Power! White Power!
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"Do not change the flag! It is a symbol of white power!
"
4,8,The KKK,"White Power!
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a racist son of a bitch.
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Don't apologize for me to that spearchucker!
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Dugh!  Ogh. Waaaaah! 
"
4,8,Chef,"How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!
"
4,8,Officer Barbrady,"Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking.
"
4,8,Reporter,"Should the Klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the Capitol? Here's what some people think.
"
4,8,Man 7,"Well, I think they are racist, but Iâ€¦ do think freedom of speech is important.
"
4,8,Man 8,"Well, I, for one, believe in freedom of speech. â€¦Mmm but then again, I think they are racist.
"
4,8,Man 9,"Well, I believe that they are racist, but I do believe that all-
"
4,8,Chef,"Aw, the hell with all of you indecisive bastards!
"
4,8,Reporter,"On Friday, South Park Elementary will present its debate, and after the debate, there will finally be a vote. Preliminary polls show three in favor of changing the flag, three against changing the flag, and 4382 undecided. Z So the pressure in on those South Park kids!
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"Well, that's enough rallying for this afternoon, members. Let's take a hot shower!
"
4,8,The KKK,"Hot shower! Hot shower! Hot shower! 
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them.
"
4,8,Wendy,"I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Uh huh.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
"
4,8,Wendy,"Huh?
"
4,8,Cartman,"I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,â€¦ obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. 
"
4,8,Cartman,"Cool.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite. 
"
4,8,Cartman,"Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make ""quadruple stuffs.""
"
4,8,Wendy,"Hey, that's what I always do, too!
"
4,8,Cartman,"No way!
"
4,8,Wendy,"Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Me neither. 
"
4,8,Wendy,"Aha ha.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Huh.
"
4,8,"Wendy, Cartman","Well, anyway, let's get back to work. 
"
4,8,Cartman,"Whoa.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  We can show that the- 
"
4,8,Cartman,"Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.
"
4,8,Wendy,"No.  You go ahead.
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting.
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"I'm going whether you like it or not!
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh yeah?!  I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final!  Let's just see you try and go without me!  Mi-Mr. Hat?
"
4,8,The KKK,"White Power! White Power! White Power!  White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with.
"
4,8,Ned,"Mmm-okay.
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?
"
4,8,Ned,"No.
"
4,8,The KKK,"White Power! White Power!
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"Good evening, brothers. Our first order of business tonight is to have Brother Anderson update us on last week's minutes.
"
4,8,Brother Anderson,"Last week we decided we hate blacks and Jews. A lot!
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"Alright. And now it's time for us all to come together, andâ€¦ do our cake raffle.
"
4,8,KKK Members,"Oh, cake raffle. 
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"This week's winner isâ€¦  uh, 2 9 7 4.
"
4,8,Ticket 2974 Holder,"I won, I won.  I won the cake! 
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"God job, brother. 
"
4,8,Wendy,"Cartman! 
"
4,8,Cartman,"Ahh! 
"
4,8,Wendy,"Say it'll be like this forever.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Okay, It will be like this forever.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Oh, Cartman! 
"
4,8,Wendy,"AAAAAAaaaah!  Brrrrr. What's wrong with me?  Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl. 
"
4,8,Cartman's voice,"Wendih.  Wendih. 
"
4,8,Wendy,"Aaaah!
"
4,8,Cartman's voice,"Wendih, look at me.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Oh God, please don't let this be happening.
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"Alright brothers, listen up!  As you know, this fine city is holding a vote on whether or not to change their flag. But lynching minorities is history! So what are we gonna do about it?!
"
4,8,Member 1,"Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll burn down the Capitol!
"
4,8,KKK Members,"Yeah!
"
4,8,Member 2,"Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll never leave this town!
"
4,8,KKK Members,"Yeah!
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Let's say they should change the flag!
"
4,8,KKK Members,"Yeah!  Wah?
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"Uh what's that, brother?
"
4,8,Jimbo,"I think we should switch sides!
"
4,8,Ned,"Me too. Nnn-that's a good idea.
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?
"
4,8,KKK Members,"Yeah, m-hm.
"
4,8,Jimbo,"So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?
"
4,8,KKK Members,"Right, yeah.
"
4,8,Jimbo,"So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"That's a great idea, brother!
"
4,8,KKK Members,"Yeah!
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"Alright, it is decided! We will officially tell everyone that we want the flag changed, so that they will all vote against us!
"
4,8,KKK Members,"Hooray, yeah! 
"
4,8,A Member,"We're smart! 
"
4,8,Jimbo,"That worked perfectly, Ned.
"
4,8,KKK Leader,"Well alright, now that that's out of the way, it is time to play, ""Whose got the silliest thing on under their robe?""
"
4,8,KKK Members,"Yeah, woohoo! 
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts.
"
4,8,Ned,"Mm-yup.
"
4,8,Jimbo,"That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy?  Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess.  Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!
"
4,8,Chef,"I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass! 
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you.
"
4,8,Bebe,"Sure, what?
"
4,8,Wendy,"Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman.
"
4,8,Bebe,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
4,8,Wendy,"I know.
"
4,8,Bebe,"Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?
"
4,8,Wendy,"Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-
"
4,8,Bebe,"Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, ""sexual tension."" Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with.
"
4,8,Wendy,"You mean, I should kiss him? 
"
4,8,Bebe,"Kiss him and get it out of your system.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Oh God.
"
4,8,Mr. Wyland,"Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club.  I r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well, so, perhaps the children can shed some light on us. We'll start with Wendy Testaburger on the ""Flag Should Be Changed"" team. 
"
4,8,Wendy,"The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  theâ€¦ the- uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we-  ahâ€¦  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment?  Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee...
"
4,8,People in Audience,"Oh. 
"
4,8,Really Shocked Man,"Oh, God! 
"
4,8,Wendy,"There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. 
"
4,8,Mr. Wyland,"Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point? 
"
4,8,Kyle,"Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. 
"
4,8,Chef,"Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!
"
4,8,Kyle,"Huh?
"
4,8,Chef,"I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!
"
4,8,Kyle's Team,"Racist??
"
4,8,Chef,"Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.
"
4,8,Kyle's Team,"Ooooooohhh.
"
4,8,Chef,"Ooooooohhh?!
"
4,8,Kyle,"W-we really didn't see it that way.
"
4,8,Chef,"But that's a black man up there!
"
4,8,Kyle,"Y-yeah, butâ€¦ the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
"
4,8,Chef,"Well of course it matters when-  â€¦Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?
"
4,8,Kyle's Team,"No.
"
4,8,Chef,"Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.
"
4,8,Mayor,"What?
"
4,8,Mr. Wyland,"What?
"
4,8,Chef,"Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people.
"
4,8,A Few People,"Awww.
"
4,8,Some KKK members,"Awww.
"
4,8,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
4,8,Chef,"I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist.
"
4,8,Jimbo,"Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.
"
4,8,Chef,"Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man.
"
4,8,Jimbo,"We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flagâ€”something that everybody can be happy with.
"
4,8,Chef,"I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.
"
4,8,Audience Members,"Ooh, huhuh. Oooh 
"
4,8,Kyle,"Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?
"
4,8,Mayor,"This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week.  Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag! 
"
4,8,Stan,"Wait, I don't get it.
"
4,8,Kyle,"No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
"
4,8,Chef,"Hooray!
"
4,8,Jimbo,"I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with. 
"
4,8,Cartman,"Me, too!
"
4,8,Wendy,"I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.
"
4,8,Wendy,"I'm totally back to normal. See you later. 
"
4,8,Cartman,"Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Hahaha.  Stan. Stan, wait up! 
"
4,9,Announcer,"Tonight, Stellar Productions presents the boy band of the decade!  It's Fingerbang, live from Madison Square Gardens! 
"
4,9,Fingerbang,"Fingerbang!
Bang-bang!

4,9,Cartman,"Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm--  Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-damnit!  Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million dollars, don't you? That's it! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars.
"
4,9,Kyle,"...How?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Boy band.
"
4,9,Stan,"Boy band?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Boy band.
"
4,9,Kyle,"I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
"
4,9,Cartman,"There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!
"
4,9,Stan,"Dude, we don't have any musical talent.
"
4,9,Cartman,"That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!
"
4,9,Kenny,"(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)
"
4,9,Cartman,"Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
"
4,9,Kyle,"Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
"
4,9,Cartman,"So?
"
4,9,Kyle,"So, all boy bands have five members.
"
4,9,Cartman,"What?
"
4,9,Kyle,"'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.
"
4,9,Stan,"He's right.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!
"
4,9,Sharon,"Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?
"
4,9,Stan,"Well, I guess.
"
4,9,Sharon,"What did you do?
"
4,9,Stan,"Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. 
"
4,9,Sharon,"Oh well, that sounds nice.
"
4,9,Randy,"No, it does NOT  sound nice!  Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band.
"
4,9,Stan,"Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
"
4,9,Randy,"If all your friends jumped off a cliff,  would you do that too?
"
4,9,Stan,"Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
"
4,9,Randy,"You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! 
"
4,9,Shelly,"Geez, what's up Dad's ass?
"
4,9,Butters,"Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
Down came a white angel and she said
""Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head""
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head

"
4,9,Butters,"Ah, I can do it again.
"
4,9,Cartman,"We'll let you know, Butters.
"
4,9,Butters,"Ahah-oo well, alright then. 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
"
4,9,Kyle,"It was?
"
4,9,Stan,"Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better&lt;/&gt; do it better than that.  Next!
"
4,9,Stan,"Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Kyle's brother?
"
4,9,Kyle,"I promised my mom I'd let him try.

"
4,9,Kyle,"Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Dude, she's a chick!
"
4,9,Stan,"Come on, nobody's gonna notice.
"
4,9,Cartman,"""Nobody's gonna notice""?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! 
"
4,9,Stan,"She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
"
4,9,Kyle,"Me too.
"
4,9,Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
4,9,Cartman,"Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
"
4,9,Wendy,"Yeah!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
"
4,9,Stan,"Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
"
4,9,Cartman,"We have to rehearse all that we can!  Now, check this out:  My mom made us costumes!
"
4,9,Stan,"Costumes? 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... 
"
4,9,Stan,"Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
"
4,9,Cartman,"'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
"
4,9,Kyle,"I wanna be the tough one.
"
4,9,Cartman,"...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
"
4,9,Kyle,"I wanna be the tough one!
"
4,9,Cartman,"You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!
"
4,9,Kyle,"Jews are tough!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Since when?!
"
4,9,Kyle,"Since Abraham, fatass!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! 
"
4,9,Stan,"Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways?
"
4,9,Cartman,"I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.
"
4,9,Kenny,"(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)
"
4,9,Stan,"Kenny says that's not what it means.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Okay, Kenny, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, then?
"
4,9,Kenny,"(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)
"
4,9,Cartman,"...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Now, I know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. Keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. It can be very dangerous.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Excuse me, just where do you think you're goin'?
"
4,9,Cartman,"We're goin' to see the mall manager.
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Do you have the proper clearance?
"
4,9,Stan,"Uh oh, mall cops.
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"You have to make an appointment first. Now move along, sir.
"
4,9,Cartman,"But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do,  so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--   Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit..! 
"
4,9,Kyle,"Jesus Christ!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Oh, God, I can't see! 
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Move along, sir. Or I'll do it again.  You see, you put your life on the line every day.
"
4,9,Stan,"Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
"
4,9,Cartman,"The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! 
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Ey!  What are you doin'?
"
4,9,Man,"Nothin'. Just... shopping.
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Move along, sir.  You see, sometimes you gotta just do that. Keeps shoppers on their toes â€” try it. 
"
4,9,Rookie Guard,"Ey!  What are you doin'?
"
4,9,Woman,"Nothing. Why?
"
4,9,Rookie Guard,"Move along, ma'am. 
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"That's what being a mall cop is all about. Hyeuup.
"
4,9,Rookie Guard,"Cool.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. 
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Jesus, they're gonna start a riot! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir!
"
4,9,Manager,"What? Hey. Who are you? 
"
4,9,Cartman,"We... are Fingerbang!
"
4,9,Manager,"O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.
"
4,9,Cartman,"We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
"
4,9,Manager,"What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
"
4,9,Manager,"Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Alright! Let's do it, boys! 
"
4,9,Fingerbang,"I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
I'm goin' to fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
"
4,9,Cartman,"And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--
"
4,9,Manager,"Alright, that's enough!
"
4,9,Cartman,"--you're my fantasy, you fanta--
"
4,9,Manager,"Thank you.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Well, so can we play here?
"
4,9,Manager,"What?? ...No.
"
4,9,Cartman,"No??
"
4,9,Manager,"Who?? No!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Why not?!
"
4,9,Manager,"Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?
"
4,9,Cartman,"You don't think we're any good, do you?!
"
4,9,Manager,"No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. 
"
4,9,Manager,"Wow. That was your best? 
"
4,9,Kyle,"Wow. I feel so rejected.
"
4,9,Stan,"Yeah.
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"There you are! You're the hoodlums who got on the intercom and started an orange smoothie riot!
"
4,9,Stan,"Uh-oh.
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"I will now read you your mall rights! You have the right to shop at a variety of malls in all--
"
4,9,Kyle,"Run for it! 
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Go get 'em, rookie! 
"
4,9,Randy,"Where is Stan?
"
4,9,Sharon,"Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band.
"
4,9,Randy,"What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
"
4,9,Sharon,"Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.
"
4,9,Randy,"And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! 
"
4,9,Shelly,"Mom, what's up Dad's ass?
"
4,9,Sharon,"It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now.
"
4,9,Chef,"Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.
"
4,9,Chef,"Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out. 
"
4,9,Cartman,"I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. 
"
4,9,Chef,"Alright, Eric, what's the matter?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? 
"
4,9,Chef,"Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.
"
4,9,Cartman,"What's the Gomlich effect?
"
4,9,Chef,"The law of physics that states, ""If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming.""
"
4,9,Cartman,"So how do boy bands use that?
"
4,9,Chef,"All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy!  Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Thanks!
"
4,9,Chef,"You're welcome. Now, go away!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Okay. 
"
4,9,Chef,"A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Cucumber in the pants. Got it. 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!"" Okay?
"
4,9,Bebe,"Are we gonna get paid now, or after?
"
4,9,Cartman,"I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. 
"
4,9,Timmy,"Tiimmmaaayyy! 
"
4,9,Kyle,"Dude, what's wrong with your leg?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. 
"
4,9,Girls,"Ahhh. Wow. Woohoo. Yay.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!
"
4,9,Timmy,"Huhaaaaah!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
"
4,9,Bebe,"We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.
"
4,9,Other Girls,"Yeah.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
"
4,9,Girls,"...Matt Lauer.
"
4,9,Cartman,"...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
"
4,9,Bebe,"Oh... Okay. 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Roll camera!
"
4,9,Timmy,"Timmuh! 
"
4,9,Girls,"AAAGGGGHHH! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Jesus Christ!
"
4,9,Fingerbang,"Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
"
4,9,Cartman,"Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!
"
4,9,Bebe,"Okay, so where's our money?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Oh uh, Kyle has it. 
"
4,9,Randy,"Stanley, what the hell are you doing?
"
4,9,Stan,"We are making a music video.
"
4,9,Randy,"You get in the truck right now! 
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad, I was just a--
"
4,9,Randy,"Get in the truck! 
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
"
4,9,Randy,"Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
"
4,9,Randy,"Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?
"
4,9,Stan,"No.
"
4,9,Randy,"Well, maybe it's time.
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad!
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Ey! What are you doin'?
"
4,9,Madman,"I've got a new strain of anthrax that I will soon unleash upon all of North America!
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Move along, sir.
"
4,9,Madman,"Wuh? 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. 
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"God damnit! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Hello again!
"
4,9,Manager,"What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.
"
4,9,Cartman,"I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
"
4,9,Manager,"Oh. What?
"
4,9,Cartman,"If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! 
"
4,9,Timmy,"Timmiihh! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Uh, god damnit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. 
"
4,9,Timmy,"Haaghh.  Timmih, livin' a lie!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Son of a bitch!
"
4,9,Manager,"Hey. This video is dumb.
"
4,9,Cartman,"You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
"
4,9,Manager,"Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side.  For a little while.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Really? You will?
"
4,9,Manager,"Only for twenty minutes, though.
"
4,9,Cartman,"That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
"
4,9,Manager,"Oh. Okay. 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! 
"
4,9,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay? 
"
4,9,Liane,"You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. 
"
4,9,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay? 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Aw, Mom!
"
4,9,Manager,"Wow. What?
"
4,9,Stan,"It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
"
4,9,Randy,"Because I said so!
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
"
4,9,Randy,"Let 'em be pissed off, then!
"
4,9,Stan,"I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
"
4,9,Randy,"No!!  NOOO!! 
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad? What the hell is going on?
"
4,9,Randy,"...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. 
"
4,9,Producer,"Kid, can I talk to you?
"
4,9,Randy,"Uh sure.
"
4,9,Producer,"Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town.
"
4,9,Randy,"Ohh, thanks.
"
4,9,Producer,"Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
"
4,9,Randy,"What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
"
4,9,Producer,"Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?
"
4,9,Randy,"Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--
"
4,9,Producer,"Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--
"
4,9,Randy,"No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.
"
4,9,Producer,"I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning. 
"
4,9,Randy,"And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
"
4,9,Randy,"See ya. 
"
4,9,Randy,"...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
"
4,9,Randy,"See ya. 
"
4,9,Randy,"...And I left my family.
"
4,9,Randy,"See ya. 
"
4,9,Randy,"And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. 
"
4,9,Producer,"Take 112!
"
4,9,Ghetto Avenue Boys,"You've... got... it!
You know you've got... it
What you've got is it!
"
4,9,Randy,"It's obvious to me, girl
"
4,9,Randy,"The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. 
"
4,9,Ghetto Avenue Boys,"Shirl! You've... got... it!
It... is what you've got, girl!
What you've got is it!
"
4,9,Randy,"Now, give it to me, 'cause...
"
4,9,Randy,"I had everything. A huge house,  and all the women you can imagine.  And then one day, just as quick as it started...
"
4,9,Mr. Allens,"Alright, guys, let's take it from the top.
"
4,9,Randy,"Hey, Mr. Allens.
"
4,9,Mr. Allens,"Heh? Woh. Uh... R-Randy.
"
4,9,Randy,"Who are they? 
"
4,9,Mr. Allens,"These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys, my... new boy band.
"
4,9,Randy,"But, w-we're still selling records, right?
"
4,9,Mr. Allens,"Look, kid, you're just getting a little... old to be in a boy band.
"
4,9,Randy,"I'm 19.
"
4,9,Mr. Allens,"Get a life, Marsh!  Alright, guys, let's take it from the top.
"
4,9,Randy,"They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...
"
4,9,Tow Truck Driver,"See ya. 
"
4,9,Randy,"...the women all left...
"
4,9,Women,"See ya. 
"
4,9,Randy,"...and they took back my house.
"
4,9,Randy,"Ugh..! 
"
4,9,Mr. Allens,"See ya. 
"
4,9,Randy,"The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.
"
4,9,Woman,"Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?
"
4,9,Man,"Sure, I remember you!  You got it, baby... You got it, baby 
"
4,9,Randy,"And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.
"
4,9,Stan,"Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
"
4,9,Randy,"I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, ""No!"" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarrayâ€”us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. 
"
4,9,Stan,"...Oh-kay.
"
4,9,Kyle,"Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Where the hell is Stan?!
"
4,9,Kyle,"He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
"
4,9,Cartman,"I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!
"
4,9,Manager,"Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Yes. Yes, sir, any secondâ€”we're just waiting on one more member.
"
4,9,Manager,"Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer. 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll have to do it without him.
"
4,9,Kyle,"Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
"
4,9,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
4,9,Cartman,"Oh, god-damnit!
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad?
"
4,9,Randy,"Huh? Yeah?
"
4,9,Stan,"Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
"
4,9,Randy,"Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.
"
4,9,Stan,"Yeah.
"
4,9,Randy,"You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?
"
4,9,Stan,"Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
"
4,9,Randy,"Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.
"
4,9,Stan,"Really?
"
4,9,Randy,"Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
"
4,9,Stan,"Alright! 
"
4,9,Man,"What's happening here?
"
4,9,Woman,"I don't know, uh. I guess nothing.
"
4,9,Man,"Hm... Well, let's just walk away then. 
"
4,9,Cartman,"God damnit! People are walking away! 
"
4,9,Manager,"Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Just another minute.
"
4,9,Manager,"Sorry. Get out! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.
"
4,9,Wendy,"What's that? 
"
4,9,Kyle,"It's Stan! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! 
"
4,9,Kyle,"Dude, where the hell have you been?!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?
"
4,9,Manager,"Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up.
"
4,9,Cartman,"We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, ""I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall.""  And so, without further ado, all five members of the...
"
4,9,Kenny,"(Uff--!) 
"
4,9,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
4,9,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
4,9,Cartman,"No! He can't be dead!
"
4,9,Kyle,"Dude, he's pretty dead.
"
4,9,Cartman,"No! We were so close!
"
4,9,Manager,"Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!
"
4,9,Cartman,"But we have to perform!
"
4,9,Kyle,"We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!
"
4,9,Stan,"Oh, yes we do.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
"
4,9,Fingerbang,"Fingerbang!
Bang bang 
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang 
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!
"
4,9,Kyle,"We made two dollars.
"
4,9,Stan,"You were great, Dad.
"
4,9,Randy,"Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
"
4,9,Little Girl,"Can I get your autograph?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Ok-Okay, okay.
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Hey, don't hassle the talent, ma'am.
"
4,9,Little Girl,"I actually don't really know who they are, I was just getting an autograph and--  A-a-agg-g-ggh!
"
4,9,Veteran Guard,"Move along, ma'am.  Eh, that was pretty good, kids. Maybe you can come perform at my Elks Club sometime.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.
"
4,9,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
4,9,Cartman,"I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!""
"
4,9,Kyle,"...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
"
4,9,Stan,"Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
"
4,9,Randy,"Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. 
"
4,9,Stan,"I don't think they sell those anymore. 
"
4,9,Kyle,"Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. 
"
4,10,Congregation,"I walk hand-in-hand with Jesus
Over at the park by where he lives
I tell him all my problems
And sometimes he tells me his
What a friend I have in Jesus
I can say that honestly
He's not like all my other friends
Who really don't care about me.
Amen.
"
4,10,Stan,"Bo-ring.
"
4,10,Cantor,"And now Mr. Mackey will read his favorite psalm for us, Psalm 46. 
"
4,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay.  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea...
"
4,10,Cartman,"Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation.  This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation."" 
"
4,10,Mr. Mackey,"God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay.  Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, m'kay, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, m'kay. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place- 
"
4,10,Stan,"Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's...""
"
4,10,Cartman,"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation  to increase the population of the younger generation.""
"
4,10,Kenny,"(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
"
4,10,Cartman,"No no, no. Separation.
"
4,10,Stan,"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-""
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"BOYS! You are in CHURCH! 
"
4,10,Cartman,"Ugh!
"
4,10,Mr. Mackey,"-m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay. 
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about hell.  Hell is not a very nice place. Burning, searing, flames. Screaming, torture. For eternity. Once you are in hell, you cannot escape. You live forever in horrible pain, in burning agony. All sinners are there in misery, dying over and over and over.  If you be cast down into this black bog of stench, then woe is thou,  for Satan has made it the most miserable place in the universe!  And he will be your ruler!  Your ruler of pain and agony!

4,10,Walter,"Oh, well, maybe next time. Great luau!
"
4,10,Satan,"Bye.
"
4,10,Satan,"Chris?
"
4,10,Chris,"Yeah?
"
4,10,Satan,"Did you, uh, see my ""Boy With An Umbrella"" Hummel?
"
4,10,Chris,"Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers.
"
4,10,Satan,"Oh, okay, thanks.  Oh, that must be them now.  Just put the boxes by the-
"
4,10,Saddam,"Hello, Satan! 
"
4,10,Satan,"Saddam...
"
4,10,Saddam,"Did you miss me, buttercup?
"
4,10,Satan,"No, it can't be! You're dead! I killed you!
"
4,10,Saddam,"Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?
"
4,10,Satan,"Oh no.  Oh, God no.
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"A place of everlasting agony and pain! Hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept Christ!  Children in this town have not been attending Sunday school after Mass! And adults have not been coming to Confession! If this does not change, I promise you, you will be going to the black pit of Satan's world!  That is all. Peace be with you. 
"
4,10,Randy,"Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon.
"
4,10,Sharon,"Yeah. 
"
4,10,Stan,"Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.
"
4,10,Sharon,"What?
"
4,10,Stan,"We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 
"
4,10,Cartman,"Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. 
"
4,10,Randy,"Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death.
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Hell is a very real place, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. I'm trying to save their souls and the souls of everyone in this town from the wretched lake of fire!
"
4,10,Saddam,"Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk.
"
4,10,Satan,"I don't want to talk to you, Saddam! This isn't what I need in my life right now.
"
4,10,Chris,"Is that the movers, Satan?
"
4,10,Satan,"Ah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just the movers
"
4,10,Chris,"Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter. 
"
4,10,Satan,"Okay, Chris.
"
4,10,Saddam,"Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan. 
"
4,10,Satan,"Oh, why, I haven't heard that one before.
"
4,10,Saddam,"COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito?  Â¡Me gusta burrito mucho!
"
4,10,Satan,"I can't, Saddam. I'm with Chris now.
"
4,10,Saddam,"Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!
"
4,10,Satan,"Good-bye, Saddam!
"
4,10,Saddam,"Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us.  You can try, but you know we belong together.
"
4,10,Satan,"My life is good now, Saddam. Chris treats me well. You and I are through. Good-bye. 
"
4,10,Saddam,"Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break! 
"
4,10,Nun,"Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And I'll be teaching you so that you can all receive your First Communion.
"
4,10,Stan,"Are we gonna go to hell?
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion.
"
4,10,Cartman,"A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
"
4,10,Stan,"What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Yeah, what if we haven't?
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works.  The priest will give you this round cracker,  and he will say, ""The Body of Christ,"" and then you eat it. 
"
4,10,Cartman,"Jesus was made of crackers?
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"No.
"
4,10,Stan,"But crackers are his- body.
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Yes.
"
4,10,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, ""eat this, for it is my body.""
"
4,10,Cartman,"So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Nononono!
"
4,10,Butters,"Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"The Body of Christ! 
"
4,10,Stan,"Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"No!
"
4,10,Stan,"No??
"
4,10,Butters,"Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?!
"
4,10,"Kenny, Stan, Cartman","O-kay.
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! 
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Eric, do you wanna go to hell?!
"
4,10,Cartman,"Nno!
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Then stop questioning me.
"
4,10,Cartman,"But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confession.
"
4,10,Stan,"Confession? 
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"You'll be getting in the Confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins, so that God can forgive you. You kids will all have to go to your first Confession this Tuesday, so I want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins, so that you can tell the priest everything. 
"
4,10,Kenny,"(OH, SHIT!)
"
4,10,Chris,"Those were some great pork chops, Satan.
"
4,10,Satan,"Yeah.
"
4,10,Chris,"Hey, you.  You've been actin' strange all night. What's up?
"
4,10,Satan,"Nothing. Why?
"
4,10,Chris,"Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly.
"
4,10,Satan,"Oh, huh. Sorry, huh-huh. 
"
4,10,Chris,"Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?
"
4,10,Satan,"Well, Chris, Saddam showed up today.
"
4,10,Chris,"Oh.  Woww!  I wasn't ready for that.
"
4,10,Satan,"He showed up spouting all kinds of things about how he's changed and he still loves me...
"
4,10,Chris,"I thought you... killed him.
"
4,10,Satan,"Yeah, well, where was he gonna go? Detroit?
"
4,10,Chris,"...Do you still love him?
"
4,10,Satan,"No, Chris.
"
4,10,Chris,"It's okay of you do.
"
4,10,Satan,"Well, I mean-  Of course, there's a part of me that will always love him, I... But I also know how abusive he wasâ€”I'm much happier with you.
"
4,10,Chris,"Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults.
"
4,10,Satan,"What?
"
4,10,Chris,"We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy.
"
4,10,Satan,"No, Chris, you don't understand. Saddam is fucking crazy.
"
4,10,Chris,"Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself.  Oops!  Aw, butternuts! 
"
4,10,Stan,"Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Oh yeah, okay.
"
4,10,Stan,"And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Right, I already got that one.
"
4,10,Kyle,"Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?
"
4,10,Stan,"We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
"
4,10,Kyle,"Uhwuwhat?
"
4,10,Stan,"Have you confessed all your sins yet?
"
4,10,Kyle,"No-o-o-o-o!
"
4,10,Cartman,"Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
"
4,10,Kyle,"Oh good. I don't?
"
4,10,Cartman,"No, you're already going to hell.
"
4,10,Kyle,"I am not!
"
4,10,Cartman,"You are, too!
"
4,10,Stan,"Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
"
4,10,Kyle,"I'm gonna go ask my mom! 
"
4,10,Stan,"Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
"
4,10,Cartman,"Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
"
4,10,Kenny,"(What?)
"
4,10,Butters,"Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
"
4,10,Stan,"What, Butters?
"
4,10,Butters,"Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
"
4,10,Timmy,"Timmiih!
"
4,10,Cartman,"What'd we do to Timmy?
"
4,10,Butters,"No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!
"
4,10,Timmy,"Timmiih!
"
4,10,Cartman,"Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.
"
4,10,Stan,"Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
"
4,10,Kenny,"(What are we gonna do?)
"
4,10,Stan,"I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
"
4,10,Satan,"I don't know what I'm gonna do. I can't deny my feelings for Saddam, but... my life is so much better now with Chris.  Yeah. It's like Chris is so perfect in every way, but there's just something about Saddam that I'm more attracted to.  In what way?  Yeah, you're right. Saddam would just treat me bad again. I'm just gonna have to not see Saddam. Put him out of my mind and focus on Chris. If I don't see Saddam, then I won't have such strong feelings for him. Thanks guys. 
"
4,10,Chris,"There you are.
"
4,10,Satan,"Oh hi, Chris!
"
4,10,Chris,"I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.
"
4,10,Satan,"What?
"
4,10,Chris,"Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight.
"
4,10,Satan,"You WHAT?!
"
4,10,Chris,"I just think we all need to get this out in the open.
"
4,10,Satan,"Oh, Chris! Rraarr!  Rraahh! 
"
4,10,Chris,"Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together.
"
4,10,Satan,"No, Chris! He'll try to kill you is what he'll do!
"
4,10,Chris,"Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore.
"
4,10,Satan,"Oh, dear God. 
"
4,10,Stan,"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
"
4,10,Cartman,"How was it?
"
4,10,Stan,"Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!
"
4,10,Cartman,"Huh?
"
4,10,Stan,"The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Who's in there?
"
4,10,Stan,"I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Well, here goes everything. 
"
4,10,Cartman,"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess?
"
4,10,Cartman,"Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
"
4,10,Stan,"...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
"
4,10,Kenny,"(Hey, dude.)
"
4,10,Stan,"God damnit!
"
4,10,Kenny,"(What??)
"
4,10,Stan,"Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Oh, hello, children.
"
4,10,Stan,"We have a question.
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Okay, shoot.
"
4,10,Stan,"Where do handicapped people go when they die?
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"The handicapped are just people like you and me, so the same rules apply. They need to be baptized, take Communion, and confess their sins.
"
4,10,Stan,"But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest.  I'll see if I can find him. Bye. 
"
4,10,Cartman,"And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Your  con- confession does not leave this box.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he would forgive you if he knew.
"
4,10,Cartman,"No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. 
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"I... see.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Father! I need to talk to you. Father!  I have to ask you a question.
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Okayokay, fine! 
"
4,10,Cartman,"Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.
"
4,10,Stan,"What happened??
"
4,10,Cartman,"I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.
"
4,10,Chris,"Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein.
"
4,10,Saddam,"And you must be Mr. Assface.  Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy.  Here, I brought you a potato. 
"
4,10,Chris,"Oh, thank you.
"
4,10,Satan,"Chris, no! It's a bomb! 
"
4,10,Chris,"Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?
"
4,10,Saddam,"Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right?  Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it. 
"
4,10,Chris,"Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready.
"
4,10,Ike,"behayin' glah, and the he find de eye. 
"
4,10,Gerald,"Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day.
"
4,10,Ike,"Cookie monstooh.
"
4,10,Sheila,"Oh, he's growing up so fast! 
"
4,10,Kyle,"Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?
"
4,10,Sheila,"Why? What did you do, Kyle?!
"
4,10,Kyle,"Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
"
4,10,Sheila,"Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.
"
4,10,Kyle,"We don't? But what if we're wrong?
"
4,10,Sheila,"Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too.
"
4,10,Kyle,"Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.
"
4,10,Ike,"Oh, no.
"
4,10,Gerald,"Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?
"
4,10,Ike,"No-o-o.
"
4,10,Kyle,"Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! 
"
4,10,Sheila,"Kyle!
"
4,10,Chris,"So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.
"
4,10,Saddam,"Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?
"
4,10,Satan,"It's all vegetarian, Saddam. Chris was a nutritionist before he died.
"
4,10,Saddam,"Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?
"
4,10,Chris,"Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy.
"
4,10,Saddam,"An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!
"
4,10,Chris,"L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship  And I just want you to know  that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends.
"
4,10,Saddam,"Uh huh.
"
4,10,Chris,"I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with.  And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything.  Right?  Right.
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Father, the children asked me about their handicapped friend. I wanna explain to them that he's fine.
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Well, has your friend ever confessed or been baptized?
"
4,10,Stan,"I don't think so.
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Then, hell awaits him.
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Father, these boys are really worried because they think they have to-
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Yes, but-
"
4,10,Kyle,"Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right?
"
4,10,Kyle,"Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Well, young man, you can rest assured that according to Matthew 25, when you die you will stand before God and he will will say, ""Depart from me, you cursÃ¨d, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."" Yes! As a Jew, your home will be the lake of fire.
"
4,10,Ike,"Oh no.
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Father-
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"I hope to see all of you in church this Sunday.
"
4,10,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny","We will be. 
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Father, I don't know if I agree fully with what you're saying. I think that as long as Jewish people are good, they will get into heaven.
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior. I mean, if you don't go to hell for crucifying the Savior, then what the hell do you go to hell for?!
"
4,10,Kyle,"Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
"
4,10,Stan,"Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. 
"
4,10,Stan,"Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
"
4,10,Kyle,"HAAAAH!
"
4,10,Cartman,"Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
"
4,10,Stan,"Cartman!
"
4,10,Cartman,"What?
"
4,10,Stan,"Dude, you just said ""ass""! That's a sin!
"
4,10,Cartman,"Oh, now you've said it, too!
"
4,10,Stan,"Oh, shit!  Oh!
"
4,10,Kenny,"(Fuck! Oops!) 
"
4,10,Cartman,"Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
"
4,10,Stan,"But what about them?
"
4,10,Cartman,"Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! 
"
4,10,Timmy,"Haaaaah!
"
4,10,Stan,"Okay, come on. 
"
4,10,Timmy,"Haaa-ay, Timmmiih!
"
4,10,Chris,"Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired.
"
4,10,Saddam,"Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back. 
"
4,10,Satan,"Good. I'll show you out.
"
4,10,Chris,"Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!
"
4,10,Saddam,"Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff.  Satan, that guy is a pussy!
"
4,10,Satan,"He's stable, Saddam!
"
4,10,Saddam,"Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!
"
4,10,Satan,"Having stability in your life is a great thing! You should try it!
"
4,10,Saddam,"For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan. 
"
4,10,Satan,"I'm very happy with my life now.
"
4,10,Saddam,"Here.  I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.
"
4,10,Satan,"No, Saddam! I won't be needing this!
"
4,10,Saddam,"D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight.  Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!
"
4,10,Chris,"Goodnight 
"
4,10,Voice,"Hello. Your Excellency?  This is Sister Anne, the Bleeding Eyes of Jesus, calling from the United States?
"
4,10,Secretary,"Yes, I understand you want to speak-a wit the pope.
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Yes. The priest here has been telling the children some pretty radical things, and I just wanted to see what the Church thinks about Jews and the mentally handicapped.
"
4,10,Secretary,"Yes, well the pope is here, but please keep it brief. He is a-very old. 
"
4,10,The Pope,"Heh??
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Hello, His Holiness. I want to ask you about people with mental disabilities.
"
4,10,The Pope,"Heh?
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Do mentally-challenged people go to hell?
"
4,10,The Pope,"Ehhhhh, what's that you say?  Heh?!
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Handicap. Mental handicap.
"
4,10,The Pope,"Fibibiibibibibiibibih.
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"...The priest here said that people with mental handicaps might end up in hell. Is that true?
"
4,10,The Pope,"Eh-bibibiibibibibiibibibih. 
"
4,10,Stan,"Come on! This stupid light won't change.
"
4,10,Token,"Come on! Hurry up!  Hey, what are you guys doin'?
"
4,10,Stan,"We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
"
4,10,Butters,"Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
"
4,10,Clyde,"Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell. 
"
4,10,Stan,"Uh, come on, let's go. 
"
4,10,Kenny,"(Yow!) 
"
4,10,Stan,"...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
4,10,Butters,"He had sins that he didn't confess!
"
4,10,Cartman,"And he never took Communion!
"
4,10,Stan,"He's doomed.
"
4,10,Clyde,"...We've gotta get to that church before we die.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
4,10,Chris,"Yeah.  That's hot.  You take it!  You take it now!
"
4,10,Satan,"Chris, what are you doing?
"
4,10,Chris,"I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too.
"
4,10,Satan,"Oh boy.
"
4,10,Chris,"Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't you, bitch?  I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that.
"
4,10,Satan,"Chris, just... don't... don't do that.
"
4,10,Chris,"But it turns you on.
"
4,10,Satan,"No, it's a- When Saddam did it, yeah, but uh...
"
4,10,Chris,"But what?
"
4,10,Satan,"Nothing. I just- I'm just- really tired is all. Can we- just, please go to sleep?  Chris, seriously. I'm just tired, okay?
"
4,10,Chris,"Okay. I love you, Satan.
"
4,10,Satan,"I love you too, Saddam.
"
4,10,"Satan, Chris","Wuh?!
"
4,10,Satan,"Waw. Uhuh. I'm sorry, I mean, Chris. 
"
4,10,Chris,"It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do.
"
4,10,Satan,"I just need to go get some air. okay? I'll be back... really quick. 
"
4,10,Chris,"Yeah. Sure. Okay.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Come on, hurry up! 
"
4,10,Stan,"Oh no! It's locked!
"
4,10,Cartman,"What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
"
4,10,Butters,"Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. 
"
4,10,Stan,"Confession box is over there! 
"
4,10,Cartman,"I'm first, I'm first! 
"
4,10,Woman,"Oh, huhuh.
"
4,10,Cartman,"What the? 
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Whoa!  Son of a bitch!
"
4,10,Woman,"Eh, heheheheheheh.
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Uhuh. Kids, uh.
"
4,10,Stan,"You're a sinner!
"
4,10,Cartman,"You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh.  Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you!
"
4,10,Cartman,"Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
"
4,10,Priest Maxi,"M-Mrs. Donovan is a temptress from hell! 
"
4,10,Stan,"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
"
4,10,Cartman,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
"
4,10,Damned Soul,"Oh, the pain!  Oh, the pain! 
"
4,10,Satan,"No, I can't.  What am I doing? I know this is the wrong thing to do. I could lose Chris. I can't do this.  I can't do this. 
"
4,10,Cartman,"We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
"
4,10,Randy,"Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!
"
4,10,Sister Anne,"Oh no.
"
4,10,Stan,"Pamphlet. Pamphlet. 
"
4,10,Cartman,"There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
"
4,10,Girl,"I don't wanna to go to hell. 
"
4,10,Cartman,"It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!
"
4,11,Announcer,"Previously on South Park...
"
4,11,Priest Maxi,"Today, we are going to talk about hell. 
"
4,11,Saddam,"Hello, Satan! 
"
4,11,Satan,"Saddam...
"
4,11,Sheila,"Us Jews don't believe in hell.
"
4,11,Kyle,"But what if we're wrong?
"
4,11,Stan,"Let's go. 
"
4,11,Stan,"...they've killed Kenny!
"
4,11,Butters,"He had sins that he didn't confess!
"
4,11,Satan,"No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now.
"
4,11,Priest Maxi,"Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!
"
4,11,Chris,"I love you, Satan.
"
4,11,Satan,"I love you too, Saddam.
"
4,11,Satan/Chris,"Wuh?!
"
4,11,Richie,"Fonz, there's no way you can jump that shark with your water skis. 
"
4,11,Fonzie,"Aaaay! I've gotta try, Richie.
"
4,11,Woman,"Oh, huhuh. 
"
4,11,Stan,"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
"
4,11,Cartman,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
"
4,11,Joanie,"Go Fonz!!!
"
4,11,Fonzie,"Aaaaaa-- 
"
4,11,Announcer,"And now the exciting conclusion of... South Park.
"
4,11,Fonzie,"â€”aaaaaayy-err.  No!  No!  No!  No!
"
4,11,Richie,"I told him he couldn't do it. 
"
4,11,Cartman,"I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! 
"
4,11,Principal Victoria,"You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman.  Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone.
"
4,11,Liane,"Boopie-kins.  It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. 
"
4,11,Stan,"Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
"
4,11,Kids,"Yeah!
"
4,11,Sharon,"We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school.
"
4,11,Stan,"What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
"
4,11,Kyle,"Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.
"
4,11,Principal Victoria,"Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?
"
4,11,Kids,"I will.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Praise God-uh!
"
4,11,Satan,"If I go spend the night with Saddam, then it's over between me and Chris.  Chris has been so nice to me and I know Saddam will just hurt me again.  M-maybe I'll just go talk to Saddam. I need closure, yeah. That's it, I need closure.  What am I doing? 
"
4,11,Saddam,"What took yo so long, baby?
"
4,11,Satan,"Saddam, I'm just here to talk.
"
4,11,Saddam,"Great! Let's talk!  Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy.
"
4,11,Satan,"Saddam, I only came here because I need closure.
"
4,11,Saddam,"Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.
"
4,11,Satan,"No! Saddam, listen to me.
"
4,11,Saddam,"Would you like a drink?
"
4,11,Satan,"Um, maybe just... a little one.  I have to go back soon. I need you to understand that we can't be together anymore.  I need you to not come by the condo and not try to see me. Chris thinks we can all be friends, but I don't. And I have to focus on Chris now.  What is this?
"
4,11,Saddam,"These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.
"
4,11,Satan,"Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now.
"
4,11,Saddam,"Really? So then... What are you doing here?  Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!
"
4,11,Satan,"Saddam...
"
4,11,Saddam,"Here, have another drink. 
"
4,11,Satan,"Ooh, whoa... God, my head. Drank too much.  Chris?  Oh no!! 
"
4,11,Saddam,"Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil!  Ewuh, I'm all greasy.
"
4,11,Satan,"Oh God, what time is it?
"
4,11,Saddam,"Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?
"
4,11,Satan,"I don't know. I-I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris.
"
4,11,Saddam,"Screw him!!
"
4,11,Satan,"No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation!  I just don't know what I'm gonna say. 
"
4,11,Saddam,"I know how to solve this little problem.
"
4,11,Driver,"We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula.  We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination. 
"
4,11,Attendant,"Oiga. Hay algo pegado bajo el autobus. 
"
4,11,Driver,"'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus? 
"
4,11,Kenny,"(Ahow..!)
"
4,11,Driver,"Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay? 
"
4,11,Attendant,"Pienso que sÃ­. 
"
4,11,Driver,"Well, here's fifty for the gas.  Adios.
"
4,11,Kenny,"(Where am I?)
"
4,11,Attendant,"Â¿QuÃ©?
"
4,11,Kenny,"(Where am I?)
"
4,11,Attendant,"Â¿QuÃ©?
"
4,11,Cartman,"This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
"
4,11,Stan,"There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
"
4,11,Kyle,"Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
"
4,11,Gerald,"Hello, boys. 
"
4,11,Kyle,"Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!
"
4,11,Sheila,"It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away.  Just really quick; she says it's very important.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. 
"
4,11,Sheila,"I sure hope this works.
"
4,11,Liane,"Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.
"
4,11,Stan,"Wow, cool.
"
4,11,Cartman,"No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
"
4,11,Liane,"What?
"
4,11,Cartman,"This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!
"
4,11,Stan,"Yeah!
"
4,11,Liane,"Oh. Well,  alrighty then.
"
4,11,Liane,"I... don't think it worked.
"
4,11,All,"Aww.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Let us get back to our work at the church.  Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.  Hello?
"
4,11,Kenny,"(Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)
"
4,11,Cartman,"Oh my God!!
"
4,11,Stan,"What?
"
4,11,Cartman,"It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
"
4,11,Stan,"Kenny?!  What's he say?
"
4,11,Kyle,"Ask him what hell is like.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
"
4,11,Kenny,"(Um...) 
"
4,11,Satan,"Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at me. Well, here it goes. 
"
4,11,Chris,"Hey, you.
"
4,11,Satan,"Hi, Chris. 
"
4,11,Chris,"You... were out all night.
"
4,11,Satan,"Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina.
"
4,11,Chris,"Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?
"
4,11,Satan,"Yes. 
"
4,11,Chris,"Satan, I understand.
"
4,11,Satan,"What?
"
4,11,Chris,"I still feel secure and safe with you.
"
4,11,Satan,"Oh, n-no!
"
4,11,Chris,"What? What's wrong? I said it's okay.
"
4,11,Satan,"I know.
"
4,11,Chris,"Well, what more do you want from me?
"
4,11,Satan,"Well... could you not be such a pussy about it? I mean, can't you just say ""If you ever see Saddam again, I'll break your legs!"" or, or ""I'm gonna go kick Saddam's ass!"" or something?
"
4,11,Chris,"Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.
"
4,11,Satan,"Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous, go throw a football around, for Christ's sake.
"
4,11,Chris,"Now you're starting to hurt my feelings.
"
4,11,Satan,"Ahâ€”I'm sorry, Chris, it's... it's not you, really, it's, it's me.  You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and for some reason, I just can't accept that. 
"
4,11,Saddam,"Die, pussy! 
"
4,11,Chris,"Agghhh!
"
4,11,Satan,"Chris!  Saddam, what the hell are you doing?!
"
4,11,Saddam,"There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.
"
4,11,Satan,"No! Not like this..!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.
"
4,11,Kids,"Wagghh..!
"
4,11,Cartman,"He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
"
4,11,Kids,"Whoa!
"
4,11,Cartman,"And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
"
4,11,Kids,"Wagghh! 
"
4,11,Father,"Where is our daughter?
"
4,11,Heidi,"Dad?
"
4,11,Father,"Marcy! You're coming home this instant!
"
4,11,Cartman,"We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! 
"
4,11,Father,"You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
"
4,11,Father,"You're just a stupid little fat kid who thinks that--  Aagghh--! 
"
4,11,Mother,"Stephen?  Stephen, no!
"
4,11,Cartman,"The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
"
4,11,Kids,"Forgive us, Lord.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.
"
4,11,Mother,"Stephen? Stephen?
"
4,11,Stephen,"Where... where am I?
"
4,11,Man,"Where are we?
"
4,11,Man 2,"No doubt about it...
"
4,11,Woman,"What's happening??
"
4,11,Man 3,"Oooooooooh!
"
4,11,Speaker,"Hello, newcomers, and welcome. Can everybody hear me?  Hello? Can everyb--? Okay.  Uh, I'm the hell director. Uh, it looks like we have about 8,615 of you newbies today, and for those of you who are a little confused, uh, you are dead, and this is hell, so, abandon all hope and uh yada yada yada. Uh, we are now going to start the orientation process, which will last about--
"
4,11,Man 4,"Hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here. I was a totally strict and devout Protestant! I thought we went to heaven!
"
4,11,Hell Director,"Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong.
"
4,11,Soldier,"I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness.
"
4,11,Hell Director,"Uh, you picked the wrong religion as well.
"
4,11,Man 5,"Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven?
"
4,11,Hell Director,"I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer.
"
4,11,Crowd,"Awww.
"
4,11,Hell Director,"So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan.
"
4,11,Satan,"Oooyeah!
"
4,11,Crowd,"Aaggghh!
"
4,11,Satan,"Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh...  muh, I'm sorry. I just can't do this today. I'm just... I'm sorry. 
"
4,11,Hell Director,"Uh, okay. Thank you, Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims...
"
4,11,Chris,"Satan!  'Scuse me. Excuse me.
"
4,11,Satan,"Chris!  But I thought you were dead!
"
4,11,Chris,"Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?
"
4,11,Satan,"Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in--
"
4,11,Chris,"Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?
"
4,11,Satan,"Uh... yeah. Gr-great.
"
4,11,Crowd,"Awww.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Let's see... Matthew 15:11. ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man."" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. 
"
4,11,Liane,"Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. 
"
4,11,Sister Anne,"Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Sister, have you read this book?
"
4,11,Sister Anne,"Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
"
4,11,Sister Anne,"Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their lives.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
"
4,11,Sister Anne,"No.
"
4,11,Cartman,"We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! 
"
4,11,Sister Anne,"Uugh..!  Wait a minute. That's it. 
"
4,11,Televangelist,"...And I'm gonna save all of you right now.  I'm gonna heal your sins-eh.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Well...
"
4,11,Saddam,"Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!
"
4,11,Chris,"Yeah. It's me.
"
4,11,Saddam,"I thought I killed you!
"
4,11,Chris,"Yeah...
"
4,11,Saddam/Chris,"Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?
"
4,11,Saddam,"Right, right.
"
4,11,Chris,"Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?
"
4,11,Saddam,"A walk?
"
4,11,Chris,"Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.
"
4,11,Saddam,"Is this some kind of trick?
"
4,11,Chris,"No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?
"
4,11,Saddam,"Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick.  Okay, let's walk. 
"
4,11,Chris,"Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.
"
4,11,Saddam,"Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?
"
4,11,Chris,"Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them.
"
4,11,Saddam,"You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy! 
"
4,11,Chris,"Agghhh!  Oh God!
"
4,11,Saddam,"Ah hahaha!
"
4,11,Chris,"Nooo! Agh! 
"
4,11,Saddam,"Aggghhh! 
"
4,11,Chris,"Ow!  Goo-aagh..! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
"
4,11,Kyle,"Yes!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
"
4,11,Kyle,"Yes!
"
4,11,Cartman,"That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!
"
4,11,Kyle,"Ow! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
"
4,11,Kyle,"Uh, I think so.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Praise the Lord-uh!
"
4,11,Crowd,"Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Praise God! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
"
4,11,Butters,"Huh-Hallelujah!
"
4,11,Timmy,"Timmiiiy!
"
4,11,Cartman,"We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
"
4,11,Timmy,"Timmiiiy!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Devil be  gone-uh!
"
4,11,Timmy,"Haagggh.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Now walk, Timmih! 
"
4,11,Timmy,"Haagggh.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!
"
4,11,Timmy,"Haghh.
"
4,11,Cartman,"The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! 
"
4,11,Timmy,"Timmilih? 
"
4,11,Cartman,"He walks-uh!
"
4,11,Kids,"Whoa!
"
4,11,Timmy,"Oh-aagghhh! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Yes! Praise the Lord!
"
4,11,Kids,"Praise the Lord!
"
4,11,Satan,"And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all.
"
4,11,Blonde Girl,"Wow, that really sucks.
"
4,11,Satan,"I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer.
"
4,11,Blonde Girl,"Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice.
"
4,11,Satan,"Who?
"
4,11,Blonde Girl,"God.
"
4,11,Satan,"God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken to God in like, 5000 years.
"
4,11,Blonde Girl,"Well then, maybe it's time.
"

4,11,Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy? 
"
4,11,Boy,"Denver.
"
4,11,Cartman,"And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
"
4,11,Boy,"Yeah, that's right.
"
4,11,Kids,"Wooooo!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! 
"
4,11,Boy,"Aghh... 
"
4,11,Kids,"Hooray!
"
4,11,Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!
"
4,11,Ugly Girl,"Yes!
"
4,11,Cartman,"He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!
"
4,11,Ugly Girl,"Wagh...

"
4,11,Kids,"Amen!

"
4,11,Mormon 1,"Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've followed the Mormon faith, and so you've been let in!
"
4,11,Satan,"Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by.
"
4,11,Mormon 2,"Well, you've picked a great time! We've got cookies and punch and we're just about to start playing charades.
"
4,11,Mormons,"Alright. Yeah.
"
4,11,Mormon 1,"And then, Brother Stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie.
"
4,11,Mormons,"Ooooh!
"
4,11,Mormon 3,"Yeahahah!
"
4,11,Satan,"Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around?
"
4,11,Mormon 2,"Sure. All you have to do is say his name and he's there.
"
4,11,Mormon 1,"I'm so grateful for that.
"
4,11,Mormons,"Me, too. Uh huh.
"
4,11,Satan,"Great. Thanks. 
"
4,11,Satan,"Ah... Hello? G-God? It's uh... Satan. 
"
4,11,God,"Yea. Look upon me, and know me.
"
4,11,Satan,"Hi, God.
"
4,11,God,"Hello, Satan.  It's... been a long time.
"
4,11,Satan,"Yeah.
"
4,11,God,"What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?
"
4,11,Satan,"No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice.
"
4,11,God,"You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?
"
4,11,Satan,"No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein,  was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April...
"
4,11,Cartman,"Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah,  and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! 
"
4,11,Stan,"Dude, that seems kind of... weird.
"
4,11,Kyle,"Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
"
4,11,Satan,"...And now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick.
"
4,11,God,"Jesus, what the hell happened to you?
"
4,11,Satan,"Huh?
"
4,11,God,"You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.
"
4,11,Satan,"Well, I just don't know which one to pick.
"
4,11,God,"No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them.  And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist.
"
4,11,Satan,"God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself.
"
4,11,God,"Bingo. 
"
4,11,Satan,"Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes.
"
4,11,God,"It was nice to see you again, Satan.
"
4,11,Satan,"You too.
"
4,11,God,"Goodbye. 
"
4,11,Mormon 2,"Would you like to stay for some cookies and punch?
"
4,11,Mormon 1,"Yes, would you?
"
4,11,Satan,"Uh, no, I need to be getting back.
"
4,11,Mormon 2,"Oh, alright then, but you're gonna miss our big play.
"
4,11,Mormon 4,"Yes. We're going to do a play about how alcohol can ruin family life.
"
4,11,Satan,"Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really  gotta go. 
"
4,11,Mormon 1,"Well, he seemed like a nice fellow.
"
4,11,Mormon 4,"Yes. 
"
4,11,Mormon 2,"Let's go make things out of egg cartons.
"
4,11,Mormons,"Oooh, yeah. I'll do that.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!
"
4,11,Stan,"What worked?
"
4,11,Cartman,"Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
"
4,11,Stan/Kyle,"What?
"
4,11,Kyle,"You're keeping that money yourself?
"
4,11,Cartman,"Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.
"
4,11,Stan,"Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
"
4,11,Cartman,"It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
"
4,11,Stan,"Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
"
4,11,Kyle,"Then why didn't you tell us?!
"
4,11,Cartman,"My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
"
4,11,Kyle,"The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Suck my balls!
"
4,11,Stan,"Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.
"
4,11,Saddam,"Die, pussy! 
"
4,11,Chris,"Ow..! 
"
4,11,Saddam,"Aagghh! 
"
4,11,Chris,"Aagghh! 
"
4,11,Satan,"Guys, guys, guys!  Look, you both can stop fighting now! I've made a decision.
"
4,11,Chris,"You have?
"
4,11,Satan,"Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you.
"
4,11,Chris/Saddam,"What?!
"
4,11,Satan,"Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the lover I want.  So I'm just gonna be alone for a while and learn to like myself. 
"
4,11,Chris,"Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?
"
4,11,Satan,"No, I'm not going on a walk! You're a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy; go away!
"
4,11,Chris,"Fine. 
"
4,11,Saddam,"Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! 
"
4,11,Sister Anne,"Alright kids, it's time to go. It's time for this to stop!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
"
4,11,Sister Anne,"I know you won't listen to me. That's why I brought somebody else. 
"
4,11,Kids,"Wow!
"
4,11,Butters,"Jesus!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Uh-oh.
"
4,11,Jesus,"Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.
"
4,11,Jesus,"God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!
"
4,11,Bebe,"Let's go ice-skating.
"
4,11,Girls,"Yea! 
"
4,11,Butters,"Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.
"
4,11,Boy,"Yeah. 
"
4,11,Cartman,"No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
"
4,11,Kyle,"Serves you right, Cartman!
"
4,11,Stan,"Yeah!
"
4,11,Jesus,"But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!
"
4,11,Cartman,"You're gonna send me to hell?
"
4,11,Jesus,"No. Worse!
"
4,11,Kenny,"(Eric! Eric!)
"
4,11,Cartman,"Aw, crap!
"
4,11,Satan,"Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick.
"
4,11,Rick,"Hi, Satan.
"
4,11,Saddam,"There you are!
"
4,11,Satan,"Awgh... Not again.
"
4,11,Saddam,"You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!
"
4,11,Satan,"Saddam, I told you, I don't need you anymore!
"
4,11,Saddam,"You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me.
"
4,11,Satan,"Yes, I can! Raaarrr! 
"
4,11,Saddam,"Aw, you little..prick!
"
4,11,Satan,"Goodbye forever, Saddam!
"
4,11,Saddam,"What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.
"
4,11,Satan,"Not this time. I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in.
"
4,11,Saddam,"Let me in where? 
"
4,11,Saddam,"What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!
"
4,11,Mormon 5,"Hello, and welcome.
"
4,11,Mormon 1,"We're glad you made it, brother.
"
4,11,Saddam,"Ey, who the hell are you?
"
4,11,Mormon 6,"We're just about to do a play, about how much stealing hurts you deep inside. Come join us. 
"
4,11,Mormons,"Yes. Come on. Let's go.
"
4,11,Mormon 6,"You're here forever. 
"
4,11,Saddam,"Nooo! N-nooooooooooo!
"
4,12,Stan,"Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
"
4,12,Kyle,"Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! 
"
4,12,Kyle,"Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Ungh, gay, dude.
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here 
"
4,12,Younger Boy,"What?
"
4,12,Stan,"What grade are you going into?
"
4,12,Younger Boy,"Thi-ird
"
4,12,Stan,"Stupid third grader!
"
4,12,Cartman,"Yeah,  get out of here! 
"
4,12,Younger Boy,"Uhuhuhow.
"
4,12,Cartman,"There, that's better.
"
4,12,Kyle,"You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
"
4,12,Stan,"Denver? 
"
4,12,Cartman,"U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. 
"
4,12,Kyle,"He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! 
"
4,12,Stan,"Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! 
"
4,12,Clyde,"Like what?
"
4,12,Stan,"Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" all together!
"
4,12,The Kids,"YEAH!!!
"
4,12,Cartman,"Why, that's PERfect!
"
4,12,Butters,"Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?
"
4,12,Stan,"...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
"
4,12,Butters,"Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.
"
4,12,Kyle,"...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
"
4,12,Stan,"Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, ""KISS MY ASS!!!""
"
4,12,Kyle,"Together we are strong! 
"
4,12,The Kids,"YEAH!!!
"
4,12,Clyde,"Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down.
"
4,12,Stan,"We got you covered, Timmy.
"
4,12,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?
"
4,12,Butters,"Huhuh, look at all this stuff.
"
4,12,Cartman,"Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
"
4,12,New Teacher,"Alright, children, quiet down. Welcome to the fourth grade. 
"
4,12,Kyle,"Holy God, dude!
"
4,12,Kenny,"(Those titties are fuckin' huge!) 
"
4,12,New Teacher,"My name is Ms. Choksondik.
"
4,12,Stan,"...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. 
"
4,12,Kyle,"Yeah! 
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?!  I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade!  And it is time to go to work!
"
4,12,Cartman,"KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this.
"
4,12,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sure I do.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up! 
"
4,12,Cartman,"I'm trying.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.
"
4,12,Cartman,"Fantastic, then.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Now, let us begin our first-day exam.  SILENCE!
"
4,12,Stan,"What a bitch!
"
4,12,Kyle,"And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
"
4,12,Cartman,"You guys are all such pussies!
"
4,12,Tweek,"I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!
"
4,12,Stan,"This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
"
4,12,Kyle,"I just didn't think it would come so soon.
"
4,12,Cartman,"Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
"
4,12,Kyle,"Huh?
"
4,12,Cartman,"Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade
"
4,12,Kyle,"Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
"
4,12,Butters,"Huh-it sure was.
"
4,12,Cartman,"I wish I was still there.
"
4,12,Stan,"Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
"
4,12,Kyle,"How?
"
4,12,Stan,"We travel back in time.
"
4,12,Kyle,"Oh yeah, time travel.
"
4,12,Butters,"Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
"
4,12,Stan,"It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
"
4,12,Cartman,"Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.
"
4,12,Kyle,"Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
"
4,12,Cartman,"Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-
"
4,12,Cartman,"Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"Time-travel is no laughing matter. Four times the Enterprise went back in time, and four times they almost didn't make it back.
"
4,12,Stan,"We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"Oh.
"
4,12,Kyle,"So can you do it?
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"It's all theoretical, but from a scientific standpoint, the creation of a rip in space-time is possible. We just need to find an inertia device. 
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"Heeeyyy.  This kid's electric wheelchair might be just what we need.
"
4,12,Timmy,"Tuh-timmih?
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!
"
4,12,Chef,"What's the problem?
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra.
"
4,12,Chef,"You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay. 
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Principal Victoria, I would like a word! 
"
4,12,Chef,"Oooo! Call the doctor!
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across!
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"One of them is mentally handicapped, for Christ's sake!
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"Oh? Which one?
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?! 
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Why?! Where did he go?!
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"We... don't like to talk about it.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the highest expectations for them. And with  God as my witness-
"
4,12,The Adults,"Aww Oooo!
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top!  I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"Wuh sure thing, fine, bye-bye then. 
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"Alright, when we power up, the handicapped kid's chair will accelerate at a high rate of speed about 10 feet that way , then make the required magnetic vibrations.
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"If the fields are right, it should then create a wormhole up near the front of the classroom.
"
4,12,Wendy,"You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"Now, eh, when you all see a wormhole, yuh-you guys are gonna have about 4.2 seconds to run through it.
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"And on the other side you will find yourself in exactly the same spot, only one year ago.
"
4,12,Stan,"Back in the third grade.
"
4,12,Kids,"Cool/Wow.
"
4,12,Kyle,"I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
"
4,12,Kids,"Yeah!
"
4,12,Stan,"Oh! Here she comes.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh.
"
4,12,Cartman,"Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!
"
4,12,Cartman,"We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!
"
4,12,Cartman,"Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? 
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"Primary fusion initiated.
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"Molecular grenadine active. 
"
4,12,Timmy,"Aa-aa-ah!
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"What are you doing?!
"
4,12,Cartman,"We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! 
"
4,12,Timmy,"Timmaaaaaaaaah!  Timmaaaaaaaaah! 
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"I didn't think it would work.
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"Me neither.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!
"
4,12,Cartman,"You're damn right they do!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
"
4,12,Stan,"Yeah!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Come on! 
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Children! Children, come back here!
"
4,12,Stan,"Timmy, you have to stop!
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"No!
"
4,12,Stan,"No??
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"Look, the system malfunctions if he stops. The nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high.
"
4,12,Kyle,"What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"No!
"
4,12,Kyle,"No??
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"We've rigged the chair to be sensitive to his weight. If he gets off, the whole thing blows!
"
4,12,Stan,"So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
"
4,12,The Nerds,"Yup.
"
4,12,Stan,"My God!
"
4,12,Anchor Tom,"It's been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set with explosives.
"
4,12,Stan,"Over here, over here!
"
4,12,Anchor Tom,"The child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion, and so the SWAT team will now attempt to disarm the device.
"
4,12,Timmy,"Timmi-hih-ih! 
"
4,12,SWAT Hansen,"Closer!  Don't worry, son. Just watch your speed and stay still! 
"
4,12,Pilot,"Look out, Hansen!
"
4,12,SWAT rescuer Hansen,"Oh! 
"
4,12,Brunette,"Aaaah!
"
4,12,Timmy,"Timmaaay!
"
4,12,Hansen,"Dear Jesus! Hang on, lady!
"
4,12,Brunette,"Oh my God, what's going on?
"
4,12,Hansen,"Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair is set to explode!
"
4,12,Brunette,"What?!  AAAH!! Omigod! Omigod!
"
4,12,Hansen,"It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the speed above 5!
"
4,12,Brunette,"O-kay. O-kay. Omigod.
"
4,12,Timmy,"Tih-Timmah? 
"
4,12,Brunette,"Okay. I kept the speed at 5.
"
4,12,Hansen,"Good! What's the wheelchair's battery power at?
"
4,12,Brunette,"Oh my God! Less than 20 minutes!
"
4,12,Stan,"Less than 20 minutes?!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Oh no! What have we done?!
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"Whattaya think? Too forward? 
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"I HAVE HAD IT!!!
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"Waaah! 
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison! 
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"As we said before, that's impossible.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"What in God's name happened to him?
"
4,12,Chef,"Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts.
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer Prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn.
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.
"
4,12,Chef,"Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', ""I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!""
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!!
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"And, nobody has found him?
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"Well, we really haven't ll-looked.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"I see.  Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself!
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up  and up  and up!
"
4,12,"Chef, Victoria, Mackey","NOOO!!
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"What?
"
4,12,Brunette,"Oh my God, Oh my God!
"
4,12,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing about two miles outside of Denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death.  Guys, can you tell us what kind of explosive we're actually dealing with here.
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"Uh, well, it's a simple hydrogen-fusion core with a veltig reactant-
"
4,12,Timmy,"Ah, please help!
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"Which just turned into a time bomb.
"
4,12,Timmy,"Please help.
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"This has never happened in all the 72 original Star Trek episodes.
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"Yah... wait, you mean 73 episodes.
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"...No, there were 72.
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"No there weren't!
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"Oh, you are such a nerd! 
"
4,12,Field Reporter,"Tom, I understand that now, the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boy's little friends, in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully, disarm the device.
"
4,12,Hansen,"It's alright, everything's goin' tuh be fine.
"
4,12,Brunette,"Oh my God!
"
4,12,Hansen,"Alright, young man, when you get underneath that wheelchair, I want you to relay back to me with this walkie-talkie, and then I'll tell you which wires to cross. Ready?
"
4,12,Kenny,"(Yes, sir!)
"
4,12,Hansen,"Go below! 
"
4,12,Kenny,"(Hi guys.)  (Uh oh.)  (Uff. I'm okay.)  (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!) 
"
4,12,Stan,"Well, who didn't see that coming?
"
4,12,Brunette,"Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
4,12,Hansen,"Stay calm! You have to stay calm! 
"
4,12,Brunette,"But if we got off the chair it blows up!
"
4,12,Hansen,"No no, that's only if the boy gets off.
"
4,12,Brunette,"Oh.  See ya!
"
4,12,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
4,12,Pilot,"Ten seconds, Hansen!
"
4,12,Stan,"...nine, eight...
"
4,12,Timmy,"Please-a help me.
"
4,12,Pilot,"...six, five...
"
4,12,Timmy,"Please help me. Please help me.
"
4,12,Hansen,"Got it! I think! Up, up! 
"
4,12,Timmy,"Timmay! 
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"Hey, it did work. 
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Hello-oo-ooo.  Oh, what am I doing? I'm gonna get myself killed.  Is anyone here?  Mister? Mr. Garrison?
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Who-? Who are you? What do you want?
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help.  Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how you taught them.
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months. 
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Choksondik.
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"No I don't!  IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang!
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"...Two hundred bucks.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"...Done.
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"Huh? Oh... Can't.
"
4,12,Kyle,"What do you mean, ""can't""?! You made it work; just build us another one!
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"I can't, because pizza-face isn't here! We're not on speaking terms! We got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out!
"
4,12,Stan,"W-what did you get in a fight about?
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"There's 73 original Star Treks! He keeps saying there's 72!
"
4,12,Stan,"Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"No! He actually thinks there's 72.!
"
4,12,Cartman,"Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"No. Pizza-face took all his equipment home to his mom's. Now, if you can go over there and get him to admit that he's wrong...
"
4,12,Stan,"Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
"
4,12,Timmy,"Timmah! Timmaaaaahhh!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Alright, let's try it again.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"""Children, we are now going to do math problems.""
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"""But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems.""
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"""Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!""
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"""Well, I'm not gong' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!""
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"""Don't use that kind of language, young man!""
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"NOOO!
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"No??
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, ""Suck my balls,"" you say, ""Present them.""
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Oh.
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Now, let's try it again.  SUCK MY BALLS!
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Pre-sent them?
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Good.  Very good.  You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"I'm ready. I'm not afraid.
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"You will be! You will be!  You will be.
"
4,12,Stan,"God-damnit, this is ridiculous.
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"What?!
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"Look! There aren't 73 episodes of Star Trek, there are 72! ""The Menagerie"" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! Pizza-face is wrong!
"
4,12,Cartman,"Who the hell cares?!
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"I know! Why does he have to be such a dick about it?!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"No, because he's WRONG!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"And live in a world of 72 original Star Treks? I don't think so! I don't want to live in that world. 
"
4,12,Cartman,"God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!
"
4,12,Stan,"I know.
"
4,12,Butters,"Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that ""The Menagerie"" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.
"
4,12,Stan,"Wait a minute! I've got it. 
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"What?!
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"Dude, Jesus, you're right.
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"What lives inside?
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Oh, alrighty.  What the? Why there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side!  There's nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here.  Wait a minute. Maybe there's not supposed to be anything in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that I alone do have the strength to reach the kids!  I think I get it now! 
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, hurry up in there!  Jesus.  You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight!  You in there?!  Hey, where the hell did she go?  What the?  Haaa! Who? Who are you?
"
4,12,Clean Garrison,"I am you.  I am your gay side.
"
4,12,Unkempt Garrison,"My gay side, uh- I DON'T HAVE A GAY SIDE!!!
"
4,12,Clean Garrison,"You must face me at last. 
"
4,12,Unkempt Garrison,"You aren't real! You can't be!
"
4,12,Clean Garrison,"It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay self, incarnate.
"
4,12,Unkempt Garrison,"What do you want?
"
4,12,Clean Garrison,"I want you to not fight me anymore. To accept me, once and for all.
"
4,12,Unkempt Garrison,"Why?
"
4,12,Clean Garrison,"Don't you see?  All these years, your pain, your confusion, it comes from one place. Your denial of who you are.  Of who... we are.
"
4,12,Unkempt Garrison,"But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am!
"
4,12,Clean Garrison,"Oh, stop it! What about the time you looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in the men's locker room?!
"
4,12,Unkempt Garrison,"I was just comparing size!
"
4,12,Clean Garrison,"For seven minutes?!
"
4,12,Unkempt Garrison,"Aaa! 
"
4,12,Clean Garrison,"And what about the time you masturbated to the men's 100-meter swimming relay at the Olympics?!
"
4,12,Unkempt Garrison,"I was beating off to the chicks!
"
4,12,Clean Garrison,"THERE WERE NO CHICKS!
"
4,12,Unkempt Garrison,"OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER!
"
4,12,Clean Garrison,"ADMIT IT!
"
4,12,Unkempt Garrison,"NO!!!
"
4,12,Clean Garrison,"YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING TO YOURSELF AND GET A G-
"
4,12,Unkempt Garrison,"ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, I ADMIT IT! I'M GAY!!!  I'm...gay. I'm gay!  I am gay! You hear that everyone?  I'm gay! I'm gay! I'm gay and it...  and it feels good.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, children, I hope you all did your-  Oowhat is going on now?! 
"
4,12,Cartman,"Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Oh Good Gravy, not this again.
"
4,12,Cartman,"Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? 
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Children, I will have order!!
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"I can't wait for Gene Roddenberry to tell you how WRONG you are! Just like when you said there were no two-parters of Battlestar Galactica!
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"There WEREN'T!
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"The episode called ""Gonzo on Ice Planet Zero"" was a two-parter.
"
4,12,Nerd #2,"No it WASN'T!
"
4,12,Stan,"Oh, son of a bitch!
"
4,12,Nerd #1,"I'll kill you! 
"
4,12,Cartman,"There it is! Come on, everybody! 
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Children, get back into your seats!
"
4,12,Cartman,"No way, lady!
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Eric, I mean it!
"
4,12,Cartman,"You can suck my balls!
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Present them. 
"
4,12,Cartman,"...What?
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"You said, ""suck my balls."" Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em.
"
4,12,Stan,"Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
"
4,12,Cartman,"TouchÃ©, teacher. TouchÃ©.
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude. Sh-she's right.
"
4,12,Kyle,"Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
"
4,12,Stan,"Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Yeah! You suck, Cartman! 
"
4,12,Cartman,"What??
"
4,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade. 
"
4,12,Timmy,"AAAAAAA! 
"
4,12,Kyle,"Hey, Timmy's back!
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
"
4,12,Timmy,"Eh, Timmih.
"
4,12,Chef,"You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria. 
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!! 
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Garrison?
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"What?
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"You admit it? You admit it! 
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, it feels really good!
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"Well, congratulations!
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, congratulations!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!
"
4,12,Principal Victoria,"Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people. 
"
4,13,Stan,"Dude, what's your little brother doing here?
"
4,13,Kyle,"Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
"
4,13,Stan,"But isn't he only three years old?
"
4,13,Kyle,"Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.
"
4,13,Ike,"I pooped my pants.
"
4,13,Kyle,"But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.
"
4,13,Stan,"Cool!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000.  Yeah, well,  it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,  flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.
"
4,13,Stan,"Wow, cool!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
"
4,13,Kyle,"He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
"
4,13,Cartman,"He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
"
4,13,Ike,"I pooped my pants!
"
4,13,Kyle,"He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
"
4,13,Cartman,"Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. 
"
4,13,Kyle,"Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 
"
4,13,Stan,"Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
"
4,13,Ms. Crabtree,"Sit down and shut up!!
"
4,13,Stan,"But they smell like pee.
"
4,13,Man,"I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student.
"
4,13,Kyle,"You are?
"
4,13,Man,"Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.
"
4,13,Stan,"Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
"
4,13,Bill,"I was held back ten human grades.  I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?
"
4,13,Cartman,"Yeah, that's me.
"
4,13,Bill,"Eric Cartman?  And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?
"
4,13,Cartman,"Yeahhh, you already know about it?
"
4,13,Bill,"Yes. Yes, I do.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Well...  ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!""
"
4,13,Kyle,"I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
"
4,13,Stan,"Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
"
4,13,Kyle,"No, I don't! I don't care!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Here, Kyle. 
"
4,13,Boy #1,"Hey, there he is. That's the kid that's s'posed to be some kind of genius.
"
4,13,Boy #2,"Yeah, he's only three and he's already in kindergarten.
"
4,13,Boy #1*,"Come on.  So, you think you're smarter than the rest of us? Do you think you know more about the world just because you are only 3 and we're 5?
"
4,13,Ike,"Unkoo baba.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats.  My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little  ""nervous breakdown"" and went into the mountains where I lived off of ""rat carcasses"".  But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten.  But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it?  No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?
"
4,13,Filmore*,"Here.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Sally Bands?
"
4,13,Sally,"Here.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Ike Broflovski?
"
4,13,Ike,"Cookie Monster.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too.  Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. 
"
4,13,Cartman,"And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator  and... Trapper Keeper?
"
4,13,Trapper Keeper,"Trapper Keeper active.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
"
4,13,Trapper Keeper,"Ready for hybrid. 
"
4,13,Cartman,"And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
"
4,13,Kids,"Wow.
"
4,13,Bill,"May I hold your Trapper Keeper?
"
4,13,Cartman,"Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.
"
4,13,Kyle,"I'm gonna!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Hold it.
"
4,13,Kyle,"I will!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better.  Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president,  so first we must pick nominees.  Who would like to nominate someone?
"
4,13,Boy #2,"I nominate Filmore, because he's the smartest kid in the class.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, Filmore.  You'll be our first nominee. And who else?  Yes, Jenny.
"
4,13,Jenny,"I gotta go doodie.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president?  Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius.
"
4,13,Ike,"No.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius.  Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?
"
4,13,Filmore,"If I'm elected class president, I'll call for big ol' chairs. And on Fridays, I'll add two minutes to nap time. Thank you. 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about you?
"
4,13,Ike,"Cookie Monster. Ice.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids.
"
4,13,Stan,"Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
"
4,13,Bill,"Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend?  I mean, friend?
"
4,13,Cartman,"I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
"
4,13,Bill,"Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square--  I mean, four square.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.
"
4,13,Bill,"Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Okay, that's cool.
"
4,13,Bill,"Can we play some human tetherball?
"
4,13,Cartman,"A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- 
"
4,13,Bill,"Serve! 
"
4,13,Cartman,"Ugh..! 
"
4,13,Bill,"Got it!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Ey!
"
4,13,Stan,"Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! 
"
4,13,Bill,"Waa-agggh! 
"
4,13,Cartman,"You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. 
"
4,13,Stan,"What the hell just happened?
"
4,13,Kyle,"Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike.  And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for.  You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?
"
4,13,Flora,"I don't know... 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Flora, you have to pick one. Filmore or Ike?
"
4,13,Flora,"Um, I vote for... I don't know.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer.
"
4,13,Flora,"Okay.
"
4,13,Boy #2,"Flora, just say you vote for Filmore so we can all go home.
"
4,13,Flora,"Um...
"
4,13,Sally,"No! You want Ike to be president.
"
4,13,Filmore,"We're gonna be here all night! Why don't you guys just concede?
"
4,13,Two kids,"Yeah!
"
4,13,Sally,"Why don't you just concede?
"
4,13,Other kids,"Yeah! 
"
4,13,Some Kids,"Filmore!
"
4,13,Other Kids,"Ike!
"
4,13,Girl,"I want Ike to be president! 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
"
4,13,Barbrady,"Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.
"
4,13,Cartman,"It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if--  There he is!
"
4,13,Bill,"Wagh!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Got ya! 
"
4,13,Barbrady,"Hey! 
"
4,13,Bill,"Gaagghhh! 
"
4,13,Kyle,"Whoa, dude..!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
"
4,13,Bill,"Please. You do not understand.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.
"
4,13,Bill,"That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed!
"
4,13,Stan,"Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
"
4,13,Barbrady,"Bill Cosby?
"
4,13,Bill,"Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby.  My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.
"
4,13,Barbrady,"Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!
"
4,13,BSM-471,"I have come to destroy that Trapper Keeper, because it was the Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper that belongs to an Eric Cartman in South Park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being, and destroys all of humanity. In the year 2004, a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer. From there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world.  It became stronger and stronger, until by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind  and there was nothing the humans could do.  It wasn't long before Mighty Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless, including humans.  The nations tried everything to stop it.  Nuclear devices, seismic missiles. But nothing worked.  The humans built robots of their own, whole armies of them.  But nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper Keeper.  And so finally, the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the Trapper Keeper before it even got started.
"
4,13,Stan,"Wow, that's amazing.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
"
4,13,Stan,"What do you think, Officer Barbrady?
"
4,13,Barbrady,"Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
"
4,13,BSM-471,"And so, Eric. Now you see why we must destroy your Trapper Keeper.
"
4,13,Cartman,"You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
"
4,13,Cartman,"What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
"
4,13,Stan,"Yes!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! 
"
4,13,Flora,"I decided.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, thank God, Flora!  Alright, who do you vote for?
"
4,13,Flora,"Umm... Ike.
"
4,13,Supporters,"Yay!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class president.
"
4,13,Filmore,"We want a recount.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"What?
"
4,13,Filmore's Supporters,"Recount! Recount! Recount! Recount!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby!  Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore...  ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike.
"
4,13,Filmore,"Count them again.
"
4,13,Supporters,"Yeah!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!
"
4,13,Kid #2,"Wait, there's still that absent kid.
"
4,13,Fillmore,"Yeah. If Carlos is absent, we have to wait for his vote.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, will you grow up?!
"
4,13,Supporters,"Absent kids count! Absent kids count! Absent kids count!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Jesus..! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote. Now go home! 
"
4,13,BSM-471,"Good morning, humans.
"
4,13,Stan/Kyle,"Hey, Bill Cosby.
"
4,13,BSM-471,"I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada.
"
4,13,Kyle,"That should do it.
"
4,13,Stan,"So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
"
4,13,BSM-471,"Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Hey, dudes.
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.
"
4,13,BSM-471,"Oh no!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Why the hell not?!
"
4,13,Stan,"Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
"
4,13,BSM-471,"We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper.
"
4,13,Cartman,"But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. 
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Ech! Screw you guys. Home. 
"
4,13,BSM-471,"Well, that does it! 
"
4,13,Kyle,"Hey! What are you doing?
"
4,13,BSM-471,"I'm afraid I have no other choice.  For the sake of humanity, I have to kill him.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Oh... Okay.
"
4,13,Stan,"Yeah, that's fine.  No, wait!
"
4,13,BSM-471,"What?
"
4,13,Stan,"Can I do it?
"
4,13,BSM-471,"Oh, well, I suppose. 
"
4,13,Stan,"Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!
"
4,13,BSM-471,"Wait!  Perhaps there is another way. If you could take me to where Eric Cartman lives, I could try reasoning with his human mother.
"
4,13,Stan,"Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Yeah, that'd be faster.
"
4,13,Stan,"He's right there.
"
4,13,BSM-471,"I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually starting to feel what you humons call ""compassion"". It is an amazing feeling!
"
4,13,Stan/Kyle/ Kenny,"Awww..!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris?  Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget to pick up your lung.  Alright, the absent kid's ballot is for...  Filmore.
"
4,13,Supporters,"Yay./Hooray. 
"
4,13,Sally,"Wait one minute!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, Jesus tap-dancing Christ.
"
4,13,Sally,"I think the ballot were misleading. Some kids didn't understand whom they were voting for.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?
"
4,13,Filmore,"You're just saying that, 'cause you know you're gonna lose now.
"
4,13,Sally,"No, I'm saying that because you are a boogerface!
"
4,13,Filmore,"Well, just you wait, 'cause my famous aunt is on huh way right now.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Who's your famous aunt?
"
4,13,Filmore,"My aunt Rosie, Rosie O'Donnell.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Your aunt Rosie O'Donnell is coming here?
"
4,13,Filmore,"Yeah, she's very active in politics. So she's gonna set all this straight.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh no..!
"
4,13,Trapper Keeper,"Recharging.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--
"
4,13,Cartman,"Oh, cool.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Whoa...
"
4,13,BSM-471,"And so you see, Ms. Cartman, you cannot buy your son Eric another Trapper Keeper. Not now! Not ever!
"
4,13,Liane,"Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness.
"
4,13,BSM-471,"Correct.
"
4,13,Liane,"Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill. 
"
4,13,BSM-471,"Good. Now all that is left to do is destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has now. Where is he?
"
4,13,Liane,"In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first? 
"
4,13,Stan,"Uh-oh.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Here we go again.
"
4,13,Liane,"Come this way, Billy. 
"
4,13,Stan,"Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 
"
4,13,Cartman,"Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--
"
4,13,Stan,"Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 
"
4,13,Cartman,"Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--
"
4,13,Trapper Keeper,"Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Huh? 
"
4,13,Kyle,"Dammit, Cartman, open up!
"
4,13,Trapper Keeper,"Trapper Keeper, ready for hybrid.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--!
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 
"
4,13,Kyle,"Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
"
4,13,Stan,"You break it down!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!
"
4,13,Stan,"Not it! You lose, Kenny. 
"
4,13,Kenny,"(Awww..!)  (Argh--!) 
"
4,13,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
4,13,Kyle,"You ba--! 
"
4,13,Stan/Kyle,"Agggghhh! 
"
4,13,Liane,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell is that?  Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom!  Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door. 
"
4,13,Rosie O'Donnell,"Hello, kids!
"
4,13,Filmore,"Aunt Rosie!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Run for your lives, children!  I'll try to fight it off!
"
4,13,Filmore,"That's my aunt, Rosie O'Donnell.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well.
"
4,13,Rosie O'Donnell,"Don't worry, kids. Everything's gonna be fine. What's the problem?
"
4,13,Filmore,"Aunt Rosie. We think I won class president.
"
4,13,Ike Supporter,"No, Ike won.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--
"
4,13,Rosie O'Donnell,"Well it obviously isn't that simple, is it? I mean, you'd think a little kindergarten teacher could've handled this, but now we're gonna do it my way!
"
4,13,Trapper Keeper,"We are Trapper Keeper.
"
4,13,BSM-471,"Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Why is that bad?
"
4,13,BSM-471,"It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers!
"
4,13,Stan,"Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 
"
4,13,Kyle,"Step on it, Bill Cosby! 
"
4,13,Guard 2,"Hey, Mark, look.
"
4,13,Mark,"Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen. 
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman, you have to stop!
"
4,13,Trapper Keeper,"We are Trapper Keeper. We are one.
"
4,13,BSM-471,"A part of your friend must still be alive in there. 
"
4,13,Stan,"He is in there.
"
4,13,BSM-471,"That must be what Trapper Keeper is using for ventilation. If one of you could get in there, you could reach the CPU.
"
4,13,Stan,"One-two-three, not it!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Not-- Aw, damnit..! 
"
4,13,Cartman,"What are you doing, Kyle?
"
4,13,Kyle,"I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
"
4,13,Cartman,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Screw you, fat ass!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Hey, screw you.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Cartman! 
"
4,13,Cartman,"Agh--! 
"
4,13,Kyle,"No!
"
4,13,Rosie O'Donnell,"Okay, so then what we're going to do is count everybody's vote by hand, and after that, we're gonna go over the votes again manually, and then--
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, stop it, stop it! Stop i-i-it!   Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year.
"
4,13,Rosie O'Donnell,"We're just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew don't get cheated.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment! Well, just because you're on TV doesn't mean you know crap about the government! Now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds!  ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject, kids.
"
4,13,Rosie O'Donnell,"How dare you?! I will not be preached at by a country pumpkin!  I'm leaving this podunk town, but in my place I'm gonna send more lawyers, statesmen and press than you have ever seen! 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse.
"
4,13,Ladies,"Aaghh! 
"
4,13,Cops,"Wagghh! 
"
4,13,Mark,"Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this.  Car one to base--  Aghh! 
"
4,13,BSM-471,"It is infusing with everything. It is already too powerful to stop!
"
4,13,Stan,"Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
"
4,13,Kyle,"I can't reach the CPU.
"
4,13,Rosie,"What are you doin'?! Get out of my way!
"
4,13,Guard 2,"Oh, no! Now there's two of those things!
"
4,13,Stan,"No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. 
"
4,13,Guard 2,"Huh? Which one? I-It's just like I'm seeing double.
"
4,13,Rosie,"I said, get out of my way!  Aaaaggghhhh!!!  Ogh. Noo-- 
"
4,13,Trapper Keeper,"Eeww.
"
4,13,BSM-471,"Look! I think that infusing with Rosie O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick.
"
4,13,Trapper Keeper,"Oohh... Bad pie... Bad pie... 
"
4,13,Stan,"This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Got 'em!
"
4,13,Stan,"He did it!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form? 
"
4,13,Jesse Jackson,"Is this the kindergarten classroom?
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Jesse Jackson?
"
4,13,Jesse Jackson,"That's right! I believe the African-American in your class were misrepresented!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"We don't have any African-Americans in our class!
"
4,13,Jesse Jackson,"Oh. Bye. 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--
"
4,13,Filmore,"Mistoreh Garrison, I concede. 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"You... yuh, you what?
"
4,13,Filmore,"I don't wanna play anymore, 'cause this game is stupid.
"
4,13,Sally,"Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.
"
4,13,Filmore,"Ike, you could be class president.
"
4,13,Ike,"I pooped my pants!
"
4,13,Sally,"Can we fingerpaint now?
"
4,13,Kids,"Fingerpaint! Fingerpaint!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Ohuh... Yes.  Yes! Let's fingerpaint!
"
4,13,Stan,"You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
"
4,13,BSM-471,"Look! I'm fading!  It must have worked. I don't exist! 
"
4,13,Stan,"Huh, that's a bitch.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
"
4,13,Stan,"Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Awww, man...
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Alright, alright.  Kyle...
"
4,14,Wendy,"Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay?
"
4,14,Kyle,"I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.
"
4,14,Wendy,"Oh no! NO!
"
4,14,Stan,"'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
"
4,14,Wendy,"My poor little Helen.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Timmiihhh!
"
4,14,Wendy,"She can't see or hear us, John.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Heh-aaaah, Timmih!
"
4,14,Stan,"E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!
"
4,14,Stan,"'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
"
4,14,Kyle,"Can we take a lunch break now?
"
4,14,Cartman,"No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
"
4,14,Bebe,"Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate.
"
4,14,Stan,"Uh-eally? Uh you think so?
"
4,14,Bebe,"Water, Helen! Waaa-terr!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Agh oh-ight, Timmih!
"
4,14,Cartman,"God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
"
4,14,Butters,"Hey you guys! We got a big problem! 
"
4,14,Kyle,"What is it, Butters?
"
4,14,Butters,"The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!
"
4,14,Cartman,"How good?
"
4,14,Butters,"They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!
"
4,14,Clyde,"Oh, no!
"
4,14,Kyle,"We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
"
4,14,Clyde,"Oh, now what?
"
4,14,Stan,"Oh yeah, we can't!
"
4,14,Cartman,"Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
"
4,14,Kyle,"Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.
"
4,14,Clyde,"Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?
"
4,14,Wendy,"I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey.
"
4,14,Token,"Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks.
"
4,14,Kids,"Yeah
"
4,14,Cartman,"That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
"
4,14,Kyle,"Okay!
"
4,14,Cartman,"This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
"
4,14,Kids,"Yay!
"
4,14,Rancher,"What kind of turkey are you lookin' for?
"
4,14,Kyle,"A smart one, that can do tricks.
"
4,14,Rancher,"Well, I ain't got a whole lot left, it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all.  Go ahead, just pick one out. 
"
4,14,Timmy,"Timmaay! 
"
4,14,Rancher,"Oh, that one's a little messed up. Not exactly the... pick of the litter.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Haaaaa!
"
4,14,Kyle,"Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
"
4,14,Timmy,"TIMMAY!
"
4,14,Rancher,"Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head.
"
4,14,Kyle,"What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!
"
4,14,Timmy,"T-TIIMMAY TIMMAY!
"
4,14,Kyle,"Alright, we'll take him. How much?
"
4,14,Rancher,"Fifty bucks.
"
4,14,Kyle,"But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
"
4,14,Rancher,"I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot.
"
4,14,Kyle,"...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy, let's go! 
"
4,14,Rancher,"I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too.
"
4,14,Kyle,"Aw, blow it out your ass!
"
4,14,Cartman,"Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les MisÃ©rables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.
"
4,14,Kids,"Bravo.
"
4,14,Wendy,"Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?
"
4,14,Jeffrey Maynard,"I would swear it on my life. Your play shall want for nothing.
"
4,14,Kids,"Hooray!
"
4,14,Jeffrey Maynard,"Now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. Something that sets up the entire show.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey!  What the hell is that?
"
4,14,Kyle,"It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles.
"
4,14,Timmy,"GOBBLES! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
"
4,14,Kyle,"Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
"
4,14,Timmy,"GOBBLES! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
"
4,14,Kyle,"I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
"
4,14,Cartman,"You say, ""No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!""
"
4,14,Kyle,"Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.
"
4,14,Token,"Yeah, that turkey sucks.
"
4,14,Jeffrey Maynard,"Wait! What's that, you say? A thanksgiving turkey is what you require? I know of a turkey.
"
4,14,Stan,"You do?
"
4,14,Jeffrey Maynard,"During my years on Broadway I... worked with a turkey who could do all kinds of tricks. She even jumped through a hoop of fire.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Cool! Can you get it for us?
"
4,14,Jeffrey Maynard,"I will go promptly and call her trainer. On the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey.
"
4,14,Kids,"Alright! 
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!  Gobbles!  Up, heh. Uh!  Heeey, Gobbles!  Gobbles.  Gobbles! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"No no! 
"
4,14,Liane,"Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.
"
4,14,Cartman,"I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
"
4,14,Liane,"Now, hon!
"
4,14,Cartman,"But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.
"
4,14,Liane,"Twenty more minutes, and that's it. 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to ""Phantom Of The Opera""?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!
"
4,14,Clyde,"Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
"
4,14,Cartman,"OP-pression!
"
4,14,Clyde,"Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Alabama, in the late 1800s 
"
4,14,Actors,"\
1800's, Alabama! What a great place and time!
We're so happy that we live in 1800's Alabama 'cause it's sunny and there is no crime!
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"Now to the refrain!
"
4,14,Actors,"And in this little town in 1800's Alabama there's a family by the name of Keller!
Their daughter's deaf and mute and blind as a bat, and her parents can't even tell her!!
"
4,14,Lamond,"Excuse me, I am Lamond, the animal trainer.
"
4,14,Clyde,"Oh.  Cool! He's here! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
"
4,14,Lamond,"Ap ap! Do not call them tricks! She's a very sensitive turkey! She performs feats, not tricks. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the most beautiful bird in America!  Four-time prize winner of the National Western Stock Show and reigning poster child of turkeylovers.com! I give you Alinicia! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Yeh.
"
4,14,Others,"Wow.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Whoa.
"
4,14,Bebe,"Her feathers are beautiful.
"
4,14,Clyde,"That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw.
"
4,14,Lamond,"Of course she is! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy?
"
4,14,Timmy,"TIM-MIH! 
"
4,14,Lamond,"What... is... that?!
"
4,14,Cartman,"Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. 
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!  Gobbles?!
"
4,14,Kyle,"Timmy, we already got a turkey.
"
4,14,Clyde,"Yeah, and it's from Broadway.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles.
"
4,14,Cartman,"No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
"
4,14,Kyle,"Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
"
4,14,Cartman,"No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Tim-mih.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! 
"
4,14,Lamond,"My turkey does not work with other turkeys!
"
4,14,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
"
4,14,Lamond,"Alright, ah ah alright! Alri- ah a-alright. Alright. 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Dude, we need your turkey for our play!
"
4,14,Lamond,"She's not coming out. She's very upset! She's pooped all over the room!
"
4,14,Cartman,"I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
"
4,14,Lamond,"Kill the other turkey!
"
4,14,Cartman,"I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
"
4,14,Lamond,"Well, it could meet with ""an unfortunate accident.""
"
4,14,Cartman,"Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh.
"
4,14,Lamond,"It's very simple! Either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident, or you don't have a feat-performing turkey for your Helen Keller Thanksgiving musical!
"
4,14,Cartman,"Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. 
"
4,14,Bebe,"Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?
"
4,14,Timmy,"Dehh haaa. 
"
4,14,Bebe,"Water, Helen, Water.
"
4,14,Kids,"She's never gonna do it. There's no way she'll ever do it.
"
4,14,Bebe,"Helen, Helen. Water, Helen.
"
4,14,Kids,"How can she talk if she can't hear? This is absolutely pointless!
"
4,14,Cartman,"Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. 
"
4,14,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"Whoa-aaaa 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"Let him rest in peace. Let him rest. Why must he die?
"
4,14,Butters,"They've got special effects! 
"
4,14,Kyle,"What Butters? 
"
4,14,Butters,"The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!
"
4,14,Wendy,"Oh, no!
"
4,14,Clyde,"We're never gonna outdo them now! 
"
4,14,Token,"But what are we gonna do?
"
4,14,Cartman,"Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work!  All of us! 
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"â€”and into your hands  uh he... buh... 
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!  Hu-ugh, Gobbles! 
"
4,14,Lamond,"Little boy.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Timmy.
"
4,14,Lamond,"Yes, Tim. I feel I must speak with you.  The others, well, they don't want you to know, but, oh, I don't know what to do. Should I tell you?
"
4,14,Timmy,"T-Timmih? 
"
4,14,Lamond,"I feel I'm the only one who can be honest with you.  The animal shelter is on its way to...take your turkey away from you.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles? 
"
4,14,Lamond,"You see, they don't allow children in your... situation... to have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They... have to take it away.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!
"
4,14,Lamond,"They take wild pets away from people like you... and hand them over for experiments. And they're shocked, dissected, and flayed while they're still alive. And no matter where you go, the shelter people will find you. The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go. Back into the wild.  Oh no! Here they come now!  Quick, go! And set your turkey free! I'll try to stall them.
"
4,14,Timmy,"T-tim-mih.
"
4,14,Installer,"Eh, excuse me, we're here to install the water effects for the musical?
"
4,14,Lamond,"Uh, the stage is right through there.
"
4,14,Installer,"Thanks. 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit 
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"How is it going, Eric?
"
4,14,Cartman,"Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"Well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Like what?
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"Let's see.  Helen Keller was blind and deaf.  Perhaps you should see what it is like. Deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind. Here. 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Hey, that's not a bad idea.
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"Just relax. Just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow... 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Oh, man!
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"Well, did you see anything?
"
4,14,Cartman,"No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"...Oh, that's too bad.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes! I have it now!
"
4,14,Lamond,"The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go...  let him go... let him go...
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!  Gobbles!!  Gobbles. Gobbles!  Timmih.  Timmih, Gobbles. 
"
4,14,Boy,"Daddy, why did Mommy leave and go to heaven?
"
4,14,Father,"She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had no choice.
"
4,14,Boy,"But I miss her. 
"
4,14,Elderly man,"I could have so much more with my life, son. I've wasted it. I've wasted it, not ever telling you and Mark that I love you. 
"
4,14,Girl,"Robby! Robby, no! 
"
4,14,Woman,"...Because now, every time I look at you , I see her!  I have to move on.
"
4,14,Man,"Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry.
"
4,14,Kelly,"Then why did you do it?? 
"
4,14,Man,"I don't know! 
"
4,14,Lady,"Have you done the right things in your life? 
"
4,14,Sharon,"Hi, Sheila.
"
4,14,Sheila,"Hello, Sharon. Where's your husband?
"
4,14,Sharon,"Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance.
"
4,14,Sheila,"Oh, so did Gerald. 
"
4,14,Gerald,"Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.
"
4,14,Randy,"Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.
"
4,14,Gerald,"Good idea.
"
4,14,Kyle,"So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
"
4,14,Stan,"No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 
"
4,14,Kyle,"You ready for the big show, Timmy?
"
4,14,Stan,"Where's Gobbles, Timmy?
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Alright everybody, let's take our places!
"
4,14,Kyle,"Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?
"
4,14,Cartman,"I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.
"
4,14,Lamond,"You're going to be brilliant, you sexy, gorgeous turkey. With that other meddling animal out of the way, you'll steal the show! 
"
4,14,Driver,"Well, well, what are doing out here?  You shouldn't be out walking the streets. 
"
4,14,Mr. Garrison,"Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant.
"
4,14,Mr. Mackey,"Every year the fourth graders do ""The Miracle Worker,"" and every year I have to sit and watch it.
"
4,14,Principal Victoria,"Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head.  But luckily I got really stoned before I came.
"
4,14,Mr. Garrison,"And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, ""The Miracle Worker."" 
"
4,14,Kids,"Helen Keller, Helen Keller, blind as a bat.She can't hear us speak. What's up with that?
"
4,14,Sheila,"This is ""The Miracle Worker""?
"
4,14,Sharon,"I... well... maybe. 
"
4,14,Principal Victoria,"Oh, oh, haha. Wow.
"
4,14,Wrangler,"Come on. Yaah! Move it!
"
4,14,Jimbo,"Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey!  It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas! 
"
4,14,Wendy,"John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick
When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch.
"
4,14,Stan,"No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.
"
4,14,Wendy,"She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen!
"
4,14,Stan,"Helen!
"
4,14,Wendy,"...Helen! 
I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
"
4,14,Stan,"Oh no! 
"
4,14,Wendy,"Oh no! Oh no!!! 
"
4,14,Lamond,"She's brilliant! Everyone loves her so far. 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.
"
4,14,Installer,"Look, we're only here to do the water effects. We're not in charge of electrical. That's a different union.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Timmih?
"
4,14,Cartman,"Union Mafia bastards! 
"
4,14,Lamond,"Oh, heh. Look, Tim, all is well in love and theatre, right? Haha.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
"
4,14,Kyle,"He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"I do. I know the part. If I must, I can go on.
"
4,14,Cartman,"...Alright, fine! Get in costume!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles! Gobbles!
"
4,14,Jimbo,"There it is!  Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot!  Here, turkey turkey. 
"
4,14,Wendy,"There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"I cannot hear what they are saying. I cannot tell them how I feel.
"
4,14,Cartman,"What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"If only I could say things that go on in my mind.
"
4,14,Principal Victoria,"Oh, wow.
"
4,14,Jimbo,"That's it. Thaaat's it! 
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles! 
"
4,14,Jimbo,"Gotcha!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!  T-timmih?  Gobbles?  Gobbles! Haaaah. 
"
4,14,Jimbo,"Aw, thank God you're alright, kid.  It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?
"
4,14,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
4,14,Bebe,"Yes, that's it.  That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"Wawa.
"
4,14,Bebe,"She did it!
"
4,14,Kids,"She did it! She did it! Water! Water water aaaaaaaa!
Water, Helen, Water.
We can't believe she did it. The dumb kid really did it.
Water, Helen, Water.
"
4,14,Jeffrey,"Now that I can communicate the world is not so cold and dark. 
"
4,14,Kids,"Water, Helen, Aaa-aaaaaa!
"
4,14,Lamond,"Here it comes, angel! Your big finale! The audience is going to go wild!  Oh. Back already? Don't worry. Maynard covered your part flawlessly.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
4,14,Jimbo,"Turkey shoot! 
"
4,14,Lamond,"Alinicia! Jesus, no!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Aaaa, Timmih!
"
4,14,Cartman,"Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
"
4,14,Kyle,"Hey, look! 
"
4,14,Principal Victoria,"Oh. Oh, wow! WOWuh! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"They loved it! They LOVED it!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!
"
4,14,Mr. Garrison,"And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, ""Thanksgiving, Mon Ami.""
"
4,14,Stan,"Okay, here we go. 
"
4,14,Kyle,"Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.
"
4,14,Kindergartners,"It's getting dinner. Let's all eat.
E I E I O.
And on that dinner we'll invite some Indians
E I E I O.
With an Indian here and an Indian there
Everywhere an Indian, Indian. Uh thank, thank-
"
4,14,Pilgrim Girl,"Aaaaaaa!
"
4,14,Kindergartners,"Happy Thanksgiving. 
"
4,14,Mr. Garrison,"Alright, see you next year, parents. 
"
4,14,Cartman,"That's it?
"
4,14,Stan,"We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
"
4,14,Kyle,"Butters told us their play was awesome! 
"
4,14,Butters,"...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles, deh!
"
4,15,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism.
"
4,15,Class,"Yeah! 
"
4,15,"Bebe, New Kid","Woohoo.
"
4,15,Ms. Choksondik,"Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee.  Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea.
"
4,15,Wendy,"Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?
"
4,15,Ms. Choksondik,"They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them.  Now, we don't have quite enough  manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four. 
"
4,15,Butters,"Hey! Ours is still alive!
"
4,15,Ms. Choksondik,"Oh, hold on.  Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen.
"
4,15,Stan,"I can't do it, dude.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.
"
4,15,Kenny,"(Nuh uh!)
"
4,15,Kyle,"Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
"
4,15,Kenny,"(FIVE BUCKS???) 
"
4,15,Stan,"Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
"
4,15,Phillip,"Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso.
"
4,15,Terrance,"I don't see anything.
"
4,15,Phillip,"Look closer.  Closer.  Hunh-nh.
"
4,15,Terrance,"I still don't see anything, Phillip.
"
4,15,Phillip,"Waitwait. Hunh.
"
4,15,Cartman,"I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
"
4,15,Phillip,"Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here.  Ah!  Af!
"
4,15,Terrance,"AAHahahahahahaaa!
"
4,15,Cartman,"Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
"
4,15,Liane,"Eh yes, sweetie.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? 
"
4,15,Liane,"Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  Mommy's  expecting  some company.
"
4,15,Cartman,"God, I have to everything around here!
"
4,15,Cartman,"I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the-  What the hell's going on?
"
4,15,Liane,"Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a ""talk"" with you.
"
4,15,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?
"
4,15,Cartman,"What?!
"
4,15,Dr. Doctor,"We believe that you might have a problem.
"
4,15,Cartman,"You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
"
4,15,Mr. Garrison,"It's called intervention, Eric.
"
4,15,Liane,"Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Fat camp?
"
4,15,Dr. Doctor,"Yes, fat camp.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!
"
4,15,Mr. Mackey,"Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you.
"
4,15,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!
"
4,15,Liane,"Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. 
"
4,15,Ms. Choksondik,"And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-
"
4,15,Principal Victoria,"Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?
"
4,15,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, children. I'll be right back. 
"
4,15,Kyle,"Aw, dude, check this out. 
"
4,15,Stan,"That's so gross.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
"
4,15,Kenny,"(I'm not eatin' that!)
"
4,15,Kyle,"I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
"
4,15,Stan,"I'll throw in five.
"
4,15,Principal Victoria,"And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.
"
4,15,Ms. Choksondik,"Oh dear.
"
4,15,Butters,"I'll throw in a dollar!
"
4,15,Bebe,"I've got three.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
"
4,15,Stan,"forty-one bucks.  Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!
"
4,15,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together. 
"
4,15,Liane,"...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want.  Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin. 
"
4,15,Male Counselor,"Howdy there. I'm one of the weight counselors here. This must be Eric Cartman.
"
4,15,Liane,"Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.
"
4,15,Male Counselor,"Oh, we'll change that.  Hello, camper. My name is Rick. How are you doing?
"
4,15,Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?
"
4,15,Rick,"I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get yo oriented.  I'll take care of him from here, ma'am.
"
4,15,Liane,"Oh.  Well, goodbye, sweetie.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Don't touch me! 
"
4,15,Rick,"Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!
"
4,15,Brunette,"Have you got any candy?
"
4,15,Cartman,"No.
"
4,15,Taller Boy,"My mom says I ain't to eat no candy here. I'm s'psoed to lose weight.
"
4,15,Rick,"Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is  fun, right gang?
"
4,15,Taller Boy,"Right.
"
4,15,Rick,"Wait a second.  Do you kids hear something?  I could've swore that-
"
4,15,Pink Monster,"Raaarrrr!!! 
"
4,15,Rick,"Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat!
"
4,15,Pink Monster,"I'm gonna take over your body and make you slow! 
"
4,15,Rick,"Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise!  And... Proper Diet. 
"
4,15,Pink Monster,"Oh no! Exercise and proper diet have killed me. 
"
4,15,Rick,"I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?
"
4,15,Taller Boy,"Yeah! 
"
4,15,Rick,"Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan,  who's another weight counselor! 
"
4,15,Taller Boy,"Heh! It was a lady in a costume!
"
4,15,Cartman,"Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
"
4,15,Kyle,"What's the matter?
"
4,15,Stan,"Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. 
"
4,15,Kyle,"Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. 
"
4,15,Kids,"Eewww.
"
4,15,Stan,"Well, at least you got it out of your system.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?
"
4,15,Kenny,"(WHAT?!)
"
4,15,Kyle,"I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
"
4,15,Butters,"Huh-I'm in for five!
"
4,15,Stan,"Oh, you guys!
"
4,15,Clyde,"I've got three.
"
4,15,Token,"Six!
"
4,15,Butters,"Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. 
"
4,15,Kyle,"That's 19 bucks, Kenny! 
"
4,15,Kenny,"(Ungh.) 
"
4,15,Kids around Kenny,"AAAAA!
"
4,15,Kids around Timmy,"Waugh.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Kick ass, dude!
"
4,15,Stan,"You know, dude, there might be something to this.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
"
4,15,Rick,"Doing great kids! Come on! 
"
4,15,Cartman,"This... is... bullcrap!
"
4,15,Rick,"Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?
"
4,15,Cartman,"I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
"
4,15,Susan,"I hope you all left room for dessert. Soybean pudding for everybody! 
"
4,15,Brunet Boy,"Are you going to eat your soybean pudding?
"
4,15,Cartman,"Take it! I can't eat this crap!
"
4,15,Blonde Girl,"Me neither. I have to have sugar or I'm going to die.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.
"
4,15,Brunet Boy,"I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You want some?
"
4,15,Cartman,"Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
"
4,15,Cartman,"Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run?  An ice cream truck! Hey wait!  Boy, am I glad to see you!
"
4,15,Driver,"Can I interest you in some ice cream?
"
4,15,Cartman,"You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!
"
4,15,Driver,"Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? 
"
4,15,Cartman,"Hunh?  Uuh! 
"
4,15,Boy 1,"They tricked us again, huh?
"
4,15,Cartman,"Aw, God-damnit!  LET ME OUT OF HMYA! 
"
4,15,Driver,"Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. 
"
4,15,Boy 1,"They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us.
"
4,15,Taller Boy,"Heh-I can't help it. I'd give anything. Any amount of money for some candy. 
"
4,15,Rick,"Hey kids!
"
4,15,Sussan,"Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.
"
4,15,Rick,"Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave.
"
4,15,Susan,"There is no escape.
"
4,15,Rick,"So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT
"
4,15,Eric,"Aw, damnit!
"
4,15,Gerald,"That's what being young is all about.
"
4,15,Mr. Garrison,"But that's not the question.
"
4,15,Liane,"Thanks for coming, everybody.
"
4,15,Mr. Mackey,"Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at havin' trouble at his weight-management camp?
"
4,15,Stan,"We knew he wouldn't make it.
"
4,15,Liane,"Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. 
"
4,15,New Cartman,"Hey, dudes!
"
4,15,Kyle,"Whoa! 
"
4,15,Stan,"I don't believe it.
"
4,15,Liane,"Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. 
"
4,15,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?!
"
4,15,Principal Victoria,"Congratulations. How do you feel?
"
4,15,New Cartman,"I feel awesome!
"
4,15,Kyle,"What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
"
4,15,New Cartman,"You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I'm totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I'd say I'm  a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy!  Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle.
"
4,15,Liane,"I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
"
4,15,Cartman,"Memememeee! 
"
4,15,Kyle,"Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
"
4,15,Stan,"Did you like the old one?
"
4,15,Kyle,"Good point.
"
4,15,Announcer,"And now back to Jesus and Pals, on South Park Public Access.
"
4,15,Jesus,"Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength.
"
4,15,New Cartman,"No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works.
"
4,15,Jesus,"A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman!  Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? 
"
4,15,New Cartman,"God-damnit, all I got was a little golf clap!
"
4,15,Jesus,"Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny.
"
4,15,Kenny,"(Sure!)
"
4,15,Man 1,"Do it again!
"
4,15,Man 2,"Do it again!
"
4,15,Man 3,"Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon!
"
4,15,New Cartman,"This is ridiculous! 
"
4,15,Jesus,"So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?
"
4,15,Stan,"We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
"
4,15,Jesus,"I can't say I approve of this, my children.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Huh? Why not?
"
4,15,Jesus,"Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.
"
4,15,Man 4,"I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone else's vomit.
"
4,15,Man 5,"Yeah!
"
4,15,Man 6,"Yeah! Go for it!
"
4,15,Stan,"What's a prostitute?
"
4,15,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
4,15,Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
4,15,"Stan, Kyle, Kenny","Hey, Chef:
"
4,15,Stan,"Chef, what's a prostitute?
"
4,15,Chef,"Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! ""Chef, what's the clitoris?"" ""What's a lesbian, Chef?"" ""How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?""  For once, can't you just come in here and say, ""Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?""!
"
4,15,Stan,"Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?
"
4,15,Chef,"It sure is! Thank you.
"
4,15,Stan,"Chef, what's a prostitute?
"
4,15,Chef,"Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.
"
4,15,New Cartman,"Lunchtime! I'm starved!
"
4,15,Chef,"Oh my God. Eric?
"
4,15,New Cartman,"That's me.
"
4,15,Stan,"Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
"
4,15,Chef,"Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!
"
4,15,Stan,"Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
"
4,15,Kenny,"(Yeah. Am I?)
"
4,15,Chef,"Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Why?
"
4,15,Chef,"Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services.
"
4,15,Stan,"Like what?
"
4,15,Chef,"Like keeping you company. Understand?
"
4,15,Stan,"No.
"
4,15,Chef,"You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. 
But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children.
That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards.
That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor.
"
4,15,James Taylor,"A prostitute is like any other woman
They all trade somethin' for sex and they do it well.
"
4,15,Chef,"And that's why I say-
"
4,15,Chef and James Taylor,"Prostitutes! Prostitutes! They-
"
4,15,Chef,"Oohhhh  ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here!  ...These children tricked me!
"
4,15,New Cartman,"Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
"
4,15,New Cartman,"Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!
"
4,15,New Cartman,"Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut.
"
4,15,Cartman,"What?!
"
4,15,New Cartman,"I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids!
"
4,15,Cartman,"Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
"
4,15,New Cartman,"Twenty.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Suck my balls, 20!
"
4,15,New Cartman,"Fine! Then I shall bid you good day! 
"
4,15,Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! 
"
4,15,Student 1,"You guys! You have to check this tape out!
"
4,15,Student 2,"Ey, we're trying to study. Finals are tomorrow.
"
4,15,Student 1,"No, dude, check this out! It's a video: this kid, he does all kinds of crazy stuff.  Check it out! He jumped into a Porto-Potty at a construction site and stayed there for four days! 
"
4,15,Other Students,"Whoa! 
"
4,15,Kenny,"(Ow.)
"
4,15,Student 1,"Oh, gro-hoss
"
4,15,Student 3,"Sick!
"
4,15,Student 2,"That's awesome!  Hey guys! Check this out!
"
4,15,Announcer,"Get ready for the Krrrrrrazy Kenny Show!  And now here's your host, the kid who will do anything to himself for money, Krrrraâ€”a--a-a-azy Kenny!  Kenny, through the past weeks we've seen you eat mice, pretend to kill newborn babies to shock their mothers and ...wash your hair with battery acid. The question in all our minds is,  who-haht are you gonna do next? 
"
4,15,Kenny,"(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)
"
4,15,Announcer,"Whoa-ho ho! You heard him, folks! Kenny is going to give a sensual full-body massage to his own grandfather!
"
4,15,Man 1,"Oho! Yeah!
"
4,15,Man 2,"Woohoo!
"
4,15,Audience,"Awww! Awgh!
"
4,15,Stan,"Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
"
4,15,New Cartman,"This is so juvenile. 
"
4,15,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? 
"
4,15,Stan,"Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
"
4,15,New Cartman,"Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home?
"
4,15,Rick,"Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet. 
"
4,15,Susan,"All beddy-byes for the night, are they?
"
4,15,Rick,"I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight.
"
4,15,Susan,"We'll just have to give them more time. They'll do it!
"
4,15,Rick,"They'll do it.
"
4,15,Susan,"They'll do it!! 
"
4,15,Cartman,"Alright, they're gone!  The Cartman store is open! 
"
4,15,Blonde Girl,"Two donuts and a pack of licorice, please.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?
"
4,15,Chad,"'Cause I'm always gonna be fat. I don't wanna eat no sweets, but I can't control myself when they're right in front of me like this.  All my life I've been fat. I've beh- I've been to seven camps and I swore to my momma that I'd lose the weight. I want to, but I can't help myself. 
"
4,15,Cartman,"Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.
"
4,15,Chad,"I'd, I do?
"
4,15,Cartman,"Yes.  A chocolate friend.  Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are.  Look at how yummy and sweet he is.  ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars.  ...There you go.
"
4,15,Announcer,"This week on Pay Per View , Krazy Kenny will crawl up into a woman's uterus and  stay there for six hours. Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime event. Order now!
"
4,15,Howard Stern,"Alright, so we're back talkin' to three competing celebrities: Tom Green, Johnny Knoxville from MTV's Jackass and Krazy Kenny.
"
4,15,Tom Green,"Hey, Howard.
"
4,15,Howard Stern,"Krazy Kenny is here to promote his Pay-Per-View special this week, where he will crawl up into a bus driver's uterus and stay there for six hours.
"
4,15,Johnny Knoxville,"Wow!
"
4,15,Howard Stern,"Now, some people that all you guys do is perform sick and disgusting acts for shock value and money, which makes you whores. But I'd like to prove them wrong. So what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna offer each of you $50,000 to give me oral sex right now.
"
4,15,Tom Green,"I'm in.
"
4,15,Johnny Knoxville,"Me too.
"
4,15,Kenny,"(And me!)
"
4,15,Howard Stern,"Oh.
"
4,15,Tom Green,"Fine! I'll do it for 40!
"
4,15,Johnny Knoxville,"30.
"
4,15,Tom Green,"20!
"
4,15,Kenny,"(...Ten bucks!)
"
4,15,Howard Stern,"Ooh, the kid says he'll do it for ten bucks.
"
4,15,Tom Green,"Damnit. I'm out.
"
4,15,Johnny Knoxville,"Me too. I guess he is the biggest whore.
"
4,15,Howard Stern,"Alright, let's get going, then. Can we cut the cameras?
"
4,15,Rick,"And we're gonna reach for the sky... 
"
4,15,Campers,"Woo-aagh.
"
4,15,Rick...,"And down to the ground. 
"
4,15,Campers,"Woo-ugh.
"
4,15,Rick,"And up to the sky... 
"
4,15,Campers,"Woo-aagh. 
"
4,15,Rick...,"And down to the ground. 
"
4,15,Campers,"Woo-ugh. 
"
4,15,Susan,"Please, Mr. Sanders. 
"
4,15,Mr. Sanders,"No! I have had it!
"
4,15,Rick,"What's happening?
"
4,15,Susan,"Horace's parents want to take him home.
"
4,15,Rick,"Oh! But he's not ready yet.
"
4,15,Mr. Sanders,"Look at what you've done to my boy! You told Horace that he was responsible for his weight! You made him believe that with exercise and proper diet, he could be thin! When we told you it was his genetics!
"
4,15,Rick,"They can lose the weight if they try.
"
4,15,Mr. Sanders,"Look at these kids! They're not getting any thinner!  Your camp is a fraud! You need to accept the fact that most fat people are just genetically fat!
"
4,15,Susan,"Please, sir, if you give us one more week,...
"
4,15,Mr. Sanders,"Your time is up!
"
4,15,Mrs. Sanders,"Yeah, your time is up!
"
4,15,Mr. Sanders,"And I'm going to call all the other parents to tell them to come claim their kids as well! Your camp is a WASTE ...of time!
"
4,15,Horace,"But, Dad, I...
"
4,15,Mr. Sanders,"What?! 
"
4,15,Horace,"...Nothin'. 
"
4,15,Susan,"We're in trouble, Rick.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?
"
4,15,Ms. Crabtree,"HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE?
"
4,15,Kyle,"Six hours.
"
4,15,Ms. Crabtree,"HELL, I'LL DO SIX HOURS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS YOU'RE PAYING ME!
"
4,15,Kyle,"Great.
"
4,15,Stan,"You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
"
4,15,Kyle,"For what?
"
4,15,Stan,"For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
"
4,15,Butters,"Who-what's a hummer??
"
4,15,Stan,"I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
"
4,15,Kyle,"Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
"
4,15,Stan,"I know! 
"
4,15,Kyle,"He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.
"
4,15,New Cartman,"You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame. 
"
4,15,Kyle,"...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
"
4,15,New Cartman,"Uh oh.
"
4,15,Announcer,"Well, we've seen him do just about every disgusting thing in the book, and today live on pay-per-view, Krazy Kenny is going to crawl into a woman's uterus for six hours!  Well, Ms. Crabtree, your cervix has been dilated, your womb equipped with oxygen- How do you feel?
"
4,15,Ms. Crabtree,"I feel great! I haven't had this much attention paid to my coot since I was 16!
"
4,15,Audience,"Hooray!
"
4,15,Announcer,"Well, let's bring out the man of the hour, you know him as the-
"
4,15,Kyle,"Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.
"
4,15,New Kenny,"No way! I'm not doing this!
"
4,15,Kyle,"Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!
"
4,15,New Kenny,"But this isn't fair!
"
4,15,Stan,"Deal, druggie!
"
4,15,New Kenny,"(But I'm gonna starve to death if I get in there!)
"
4,15,Announcer,"And here he is, Kenny McCormick!  We can watch him on the video monitors. How are you doin' in there, Kenny? 
"
4,15,Mrs. McCormick,"That's my boy! 
"
4,15,Rick,"Good-bye, Chad.
"
4,15,Chad's Dad,"We'll be wanting our refund, naturally.
"
4,15,Rick,"Naturally.
"
4,15,Susan,"Good-bye, Alice.
"
4,15,Alice,"Good-bye. Thank you.
"
4,15,Rick,"Oh, don't thank us. We failed you.
"
4,15,Cartman,"...65, 66, 67... 
"
4,15,Chad,"Wait a second! This isn't right!  It's time for me to be responsible for my own actions! Mom, Dad, we've been eating candy this whole time! Eric Cartman's been sneaking in junk food!
"
4,15,Cartman,"Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!
"
4,15,Horace,"No, he's right. The counselors've been doing a good job. We've just been cheating.
"
4,15,Other campers,"Yeah.
"
4,15,Horace,"I believe I can lose the weight with exercise and proper diet. I don't wanna make excuses no more.
"
4,15,Girl,"Me neither.
"
4,15,Other campers,"Yeah. 
"
4,15,Horace,"If you take us back, we promise we won't cheat.
"
4,15,Rick,"Well, it's alright with me. Parents?
"
4,15,Mr. Sanders,"Well, what the heck. Maybe when you're all done you can teach me a thing or two, huh son? 
"
4,15,Cartman,"You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! 
"
4,15,Susan,"Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here anymore.
"
4,15,Campers,"Yeah.
"
4,15,Cartman,"What?!
"
4,15,Rick,"Bubbye. 
"
4,15,Cartman,"Well, screw you, fatasses! 
"
4,15,Audience,"Four, three, two, one!
"
4,15,Announcer,"He did it! Come on out, Kenny!  You made it six hours, Kenny. Come on out of there.  Hmmm. Uh, Ms. Crabtree, maybe you could give him a little push. 
"
4,15,Audience,"OOOOHHHHHH!
"
4,15,Dr. Doctor,"He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.
"
4,15,Ms. Crabtree,"I told you I was a tight virgin flower.
"
4,15,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
"
4,15,Announcer,"Well, he gave his life for our amusement. One little boy who dared to be different. Let us never forget... Kenny McCormick.  Who was that?
"
4,16,Kyle,"Come on. Throw the football, Ike.
"
4,16,Ike,"No on dahdo. 
"
4,16,Stan,"Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Hepatitis B?
"
4,16,Cartman,"No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
"
4,16,Kyle,"...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
"
4,16,Stan,"We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Hold on. I'll be right back. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?
"
4,16,Sheila,"No, Kyle.
"
4,16,Kyle,"But all the guys are going!
"
4,16,Sheila,"Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.
"
4,16,Kyle,"But Mom, I-
"
4,16,Gerald,"The answer is no, Kyle!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Ugh! 
"
4,16,Kyle,"My parents said I can't go.
"
4,16,Stan,"Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
"
4,16,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
4,16,Kyle,"Ah. Oh, now I already told them.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Well, I guess you're screwed, then. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!
"
4,16,Sheila,"Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!
"
4,16,Kyle,"What's Cuba?
"
4,16,Gerald,"A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
"
4,16,Kyle,"And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
"
4,16,Sheila,"The whole thing.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Hoh, geez. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
"
4,16,Kyle,"And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.
"
4,16,Castro,"Â¡Â¡Llamen a todos junto!!
"
4,16,Reporter,"Once again, this does mark the end of Communism in Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced by a young boy's letter.  Now the country is again open to American tourism.  Plans can finally resume for Knott's Berry Farm Cuba. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
"
4,16,Sheila,"No you can't!
"
4,16,Kyle,"What??
"
4,16,Gerald,"Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.
"
4,16,Kyle,"But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!
"
4,16,Sheila,"We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.
"
4,16,Kyle,"But that's not fair! You lied to me!
"
4,16,Gerald,"Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-
"
4,16,Kyle,"What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
"
4,16,Gerald,"Because we're your parents!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Well I wish I didn't have any parents! 
"
4,16,Sheila,"Kyle!
"
4,16,Kyle,"It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
"
4,16,Stan,"Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
"
4,16,Kyle,"They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.
"
4,16,Kyle,"How?!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
"
4,16,Stan,"The police?
"
4,16,Cartman,"Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
"
4,16,Kyle,"What's that?
"
4,16,Cartman,"I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Wow! Three months without parents!
"
4,16,Kenny,"(Wow, that is awesome!)
"
4,16,Stan,"But what do the police do to them?
"
4,16,Kyle,"Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
"
4,16,Cartman,"You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  ""my parents molestered me.""
"
4,16,Kyle,"""My parents molestered me.""
"
4,16,Cartman,"No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  ""My parents molestered me.""  And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say  ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.
"
4,16,Kyle,"What's ""bad touch""?
"
4,16,Cartman,"Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch.""
"
4,16,Kyle,"Okay, molestered, bad touch.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready.
"
4,16,Sheila,"Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that.
"
4,16,Case Worker,"You do have the right to remain silent, ma'am. I suggest you use that right.
"
4,16,Sheila,"Ugh, please, just listen to me!  What about my children? Who will take care of them?
"
4,16,Case Worker,"Oh, now you care?! They're going to live with their grandmother.
"
4,16,Sheila,"Their grandmother's been dead for three years.  You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your-  mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!
"
4,16,Case Worker,"They'll never be able to hurt you again. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"Cool, thanks.
"
4,16,Case Worker,"Alright, folks. Our work here is done. 
"
4,16,Stan/Kyle,"Alright! 
"
4,16,Stan,"Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
"
4,16,Kids,"Yeah, uh huh, woo hoo!
"
4,16,TV Announcer,"The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.
"
4,16,Cartman,"You guys! Come out here! 
"
4,16,Stan,"What's going on?
"
4,16,Cartman,"Notice anything?  Watch. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"...Nothing.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town.  They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested
"
4,16,Kyle,"Not one adult left?
"
4,16,Stan,"...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
"
4,16,Woman,"Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are.
"
4,16,Man,"I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on?
"
4,16,Woman,"There has to be a town around here somewhere.
"
4,16,Man,"Maybe you're reading the map wrong.
"
4,16,Woman,"Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads. 
"
4,16,Man,"What the?  Oh no. No, no, no, no.
"
4,16,Woman,"What's the matter with it?
"
4,16,Man,"I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles.
"
4,16,Woman,"Oh, look! There's a town up ahead.  Smiley Town? That's a strange name.
"
4,16,Man,"Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles. 
"
4,16,Woman,"Hello? Is anybody here? 
"
4,16,Butters,"Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?
"
4,16,Man,"...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car.
"
4,16,Butters,"Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?
"
4,16,Man,"...It's... just you here?
"
4,16,Butters,"No, uh Craig's here, too.
"
4,16,Man,"Oh, good.
"
4,16,Butters,"But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! 
"
4,16,Craig,"What?
"
4,16,Man,"Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?
"
4,16,Butters,"Huuuhhhh, no.
"
4,16,Man,"How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?
"
4,16,Butters,"Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
"
4,16,Man,"Fine! Can you take us there?
"
4,16,Craig,"You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?
"
4,16,Woman,"Yes.
"
4,16,Butters,"Uhh rrreeally are you sure?
"
4,16,Man,"Yes.
"
4,16,Butters,"Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.
"
4,16,Craig,"This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line.
"
4,16,Man,"Well, can you help us find the phone, please?
"
4,16,Craig,"Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.
"
4,16,Woman,"Why not?!
"
4,16,Man,"Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games.
"
4,16,Craig,"Craig.
"
4,16,Man,"What?
"
4,16,Craig,"It's Spaceman Craig. 
"
4,16,Two Small Voices,"Carousel. 
"
4,16,More Voices,"Nah nah nanah nah! 
"
4,16,Man,"Look, there's an elementary school  Come on, there might be some teachers inside. 
"
4,16,Linda,"What is that? WAAH What do you want from us??
"
4,16,Man,"Linda, it's a remote-controlled car.  Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it. 
"
4,16,Linda,"Mark, I don't like this.
"
4,16,Mark,"Relax, Linda, everything's fine.  Ow.  Ow. 
"
4,16,Linda,"What is it?! Acid?!
"
4,16,Mark,"No, uh, it's lemon juice.
"
4,16,Linda,"Oh God! Are you blind?!
"
4,16,Mark,"No, it just really, really, really hurts!
"
4,16,Linda,"Mark? Mark, look.  Well, hello. What's your name?  What- what do you want?
"
4,16,Jenny,"We wanna play.
"
4,16,Linda,"Mark, I'm scared!
"
4,16,Mark,"Don't be scared. They're just kids.  Where are your parents?!
"
4,16,Filmore,"We already played with our parents.
"
4,16,Jenny,"How, we wanna play wit' youuuu. 
"
4,16,Mark,"...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out.
"
4,16,Kindergartners,"We wanna play wit' you! 
"
4,16,Mark,"Get off me! 
"
4,16,Linda,"Oh God, Mark! Help! 
"
4,16,Filmore,"Oh no! She's crossing the white line!
"
4,16,Kindergartners,"Whoa! 
"
4,16,Kindergartner,"Spitwads! 
"
4,16,Craig,"Take that, kindergartners!
"
4,16,Kindergartners,"Ew! 
"
4,16,Mark,"What the hell is gong on here?!
"
4,16,Craig,"Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them.
"
4,16,Mark,"Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!
"
4,16,Craig,"I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
"
4,16,Mark,"The mayor! Good! Finally!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.
"
4,16,Linda,"You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.
"
4,16,Mark,"No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
"
4,16,Cartman,"Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!
"
4,16,Linda,"Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?
"
4,16,Cartman,"Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.
"
4,16,Mark,"No phones, either? How do you communicate?
"
4,16,Cartman,"Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. 
"
4,16,Mark,"Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright? 
"
4,16,Butter's Voice,"It's gonna be about three days. 
"
4,16,Cartman,"So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too.  Ringy-ding?
"
4,16,Mark,"I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!
"
4,16,Francis,"SpitBall!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. 
"
4,16,Linda,"Mark, are we doing the right thing?
"
4,16,Mark,"Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!
"
4,16,Linda,"I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
"
4,16,Mark,"Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!
"
4,16,Linda,"Hey, I think you'd make a great father.
"
4,16,Mark,"Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D-  Look, here's the book they've been talking about-  it makes no sense.
"
4,16,Linda,"My God! Mark!  What is it??
"
4,16,Mark,"It's a boy.  They... killed him.
"
4,16,Linda,"The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here.
"
4,16,Kindergartners,"Nah nah nanah nah!
"
4,16,Linda,"Na-a-ah! 
"
4,16,Mark,"Oh no! 
"
4,16,Linda,"Mark!
"
4,16,Mark,"Uh. The fat kid told us to take it. 
"
4,16,Mark,"Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up! 
"
4,16,Kids,"Nah nah nanah nah! 
"
4,16,Stan,"You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
4,16,Mark,"Why are you doing this?
"
4,16,Stan,"How come you wanna help the fatass?!
"
4,16,Mark,"Who?
"
4,16,Kyle,"The fatass. The mayor.
"
4,16,Mark,"Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than-  -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore.
"
4,16,Stan,"You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
"
4,16,Linda,"Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?
"
4,16,Kyle,"Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
"
4,16,Linda,"But what about before that?
"
4,16,Stan,"You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
"
4,16,Linda,"Yes!!
"
4,16,Stan,"If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
"
4,16,Mark,"I'll do anything to get to a phone!
"
4,16,Stan,"Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
"
4,16,Kids,"The Before time.
"
4,16,Boy,"The story of the before time.
"
4,16,Stan,"Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. 
"
4,16,Kids,"Yuck, yuck, yuck.
"
4,16,Stan,"And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. 
"
4,16,Kids,"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
"
4,16,Stan,"Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. 
"
4,16,Kids,"Provider. Provider.
"
4,16,Stan,"The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. 
"
4,16,Kids,"Boo!
"
4,16,Boy,"Bwack bwack!
"
4,16,Kids,"Coosh!
"
4,16,Stan,"So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. 
"
4,16,Kids,"Carousel, Carousel.
"
4,16,Stan,"We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
"
4,16,Mark,"Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?
"
4,16,Stan,"Yes. No foolies.
"
4,16,Kids,"No foolies.
"
4,16,Mark,"No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone.
"
4,16,Linda,"Mark, I'm scared. 
"
4,16,Mark,"I know, but this will all be over soon.
"
4,16,Sheila,"Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!
"
4,16,Gerald,"Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?
"
4,16,Sheila,"Oh, it's awful! Just awful.
"
4,16,Speaker,"Alright parents, let's all take our seats.  My name is Scott Evans, and I am a prison rehabilitation counselor.
"
4,16,Randy,"Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.
"
4,16,Gerald,"Eh, neither did we.
"
4,16,Mrs. McCormick,"We didn't, either.
"
4,16,Mr. Evans,"Enough, enough!  Look, it's obvious we have a lot of emotional issues and personal demons to face here. During your prison time, you will all be spending one hour a day in therapy here with me. What I want you to do is learn to control those sick, sexual urges you have. Now we're gonna try an exercise: I'm gonna confront you with what you lust after most.  Alright parents, now I, I know this is difficult, but I want you to just look at this child. Just try to suppress your urges to rape him.  Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body.
"
4,16,Gerald,"Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!
"
4,16,Mr. Evans,"Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!
"
4,16,Gerald,"I don't have any urges!
"
4,16,Mr. Evans,"I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down!  Look, I know this is very difficult for all of you. Most of you are still in denial about what you've done! To you it seems you've never raped your children at all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu.  Now let's try again.  Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it!
"
4,16,Linda,"Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. 
"
4,16,Butters,"I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.
"
4,16,Linda,"Oh no. NO!  Aaaah! 
"
4,16,Cartman,"Where is your husband?
"
4,16,Linda,"Uh, uh...
"
4,16,Cartman,"Seize her! 
"
4,16,Mark,"Alright, I got the book for you. 
"
4,16,Stan,"Awesu-home!
"
4,16,Mark,"Now, can I please have the cell phone?
"
4,16,Kyle,"Sure, outlander. I'll get it 
"
4,16,Cartman,"Outlander! 
"
4,16,Cartman,"Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!
"
4,16,Butters,"Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
"
4,16,Cartman,"Butters, calm down, alright?
"
4,16,Mr. Evans,"Okay, so what are some other things that we can do besides molest our children?
"
4,16,Man,"See a movie?
"
4,16,Mr. Evans,"Sure, ""see a movie""'s good.  We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else?
"
4,16,Mrs. McCormick,"Make a sweater?
"
4,16,Mr. Evans,"Uh huh. I'll put ah, ""knitting, sewing.""  Who's got another one?
"
4,16,Blond Man,"Molest children?
"
4,16,Mr. Evans,"Nonono, we're looking for things to do besides molesting our children.
"
4,16,Blond Man,"Oh. Fishing?
"
4,16,Mr. Evans,"Fishing's good. Uh huh. 
"
4,16,Cartman,"I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! 
"
4,16,Linda,"Mmrrhhhh!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Heh, heheh.
"
4,16,Linda,"Rrrmm-mmrrhh!
"
4,16,Mark,"Give him the book back.
"
4,16,Stan,"No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
"
4,16,Cartman,"We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!
"
4,16,Mark,"Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble! 
"
4,16,Cartman,"The Provider awakes!
"
4,16,Stan,"It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn. 
"
4,16,Butters,"Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!
"
4,16,Mark,"Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!
"
4,16,Linda,"Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.
"
4,16,Mark,"What? 
"
4,16,Butters,"I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! 
"
4,16,Mark,"Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!
"
4,16,Stan,"Parents?
"
4,16,Mark,"The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now.  They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much.  Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this!  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Parents. Mom. Dad.
"
4,16,Butters,"Oh boy, here it comes!
"
4,16,Mark,"If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word. 
"
4,16,Stan,"He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
"
4,16,Mark,"Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
"
4,16,Cartman,"Take him down. 
"
4,16,Butters,"Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 
"
4,16,Linda,"Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
"
4,16,Mark,"Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some.
"
4,16,Linda,"Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow! 
"
4,16,Stan,"Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
"
4,16,Stan,"Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
"
4,16,Linda,"Hey, kids.
"
4,16,Stan,"Hey, you guys came back!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Did you make it to your job interview?
"
4,16,Mark,"Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
"
4,16,Linda,"And I got my tubes tied.
"
4,16,Kids,"Alright!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
"
4,16,Kids,"Yeah.
"
4,16,Butters,"Hey! Here they come! 
"
4,16,Kyle,"Mom! Dad!
"
4,16,Sheila,"Kids! 
"
4,16,Parents,"...Come here, come here.
"
4,16,Sheila,"Oh, Kyle. Ike, sweetie, you're OK. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"Yeah. We're fine.
"
4,16,Gerald,"Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.
"
4,16,Kyle,"But you didn't do anything to me.
"
4,16,Gerald,"Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.
"
4,16,Sheila,"It won't happen again. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"But, you guys, I--
"
4,16,Sharon,"Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't.
"
4,16,Liane,"We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see.
"
4,16,Stephen Stotch,"We love you, son, but we only love you in a platonic way from now on.
"
4,16,Butters,"Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?
"
4,16,Mrs. McCormick,"Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is he?
"
4,16,Jenny's Mother,"Everything's gonna be alright now, Jenny.  Come on, let's go home. 
"
4,16,Stan,"Huh.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Huh.
"
4,16,Mark,"Well, what are you kids gonna do now?
"
4,16,Stan,"I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
"
4,16,Kyle,"Sure. 
"
4,16,Cartman,"Snow igloos kick ass. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.
"
4,17,Ike,"Oooh nooo, poopies.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 
"
4,17,Sheila,"It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
"
4,17,Sheila,"Alright, bubbe.  Oh, and boys? Happy Chanukah.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Happy Chanukah, Mom. 
"
4,17,Ike,"Ayaaa ta.  Weee! Weee... 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Go away!
"
4,17,Stan,"A-ah huh.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
"
4,17,Stan,"Ho-o-oh.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Okay, good. You're all here.
"
4,17,Stan,"What is this all about, Kyle?
"
4,17,Kyle,"It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
"
4,17,Cartman,"Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
"
4,17,Cartman,"Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
"
4,17,Kyle,"If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Heh-tchoo!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Dude, you sneezed on my back!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Hey, look.  Hello?
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Hoowwddyy ho! 
"
4,17,Kyle,"...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle.
"
4,17,Kyle,"But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family.  Honey!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Family?
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn.
"
4,17,Autumn,"Howdy-hey kids!  Would you like a drink?
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"They're too young to drink, honey.
"
4,17,Autumn,"Hey haa, it's Christmas!
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids!  This is our son, Cornwallis.
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"Hoowwdy Ho! 
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Our daughter Amber.
"
4,17,Amber,"Hoowwdy Ho! 
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"And our son, Simon.
"
4,17,Simon,"Eee, hey! Hnhn.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head.
"
4,17,Siimon,"Heh What? Dad? Huh?
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Nothin', Simon.
"
4,17,Kyle,"A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.
"
4,17,Stan,"I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
"
4,17,Cartman,"My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer!  And if you want, you can help them.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Sure we'll help! 
"
4,17,Cartman,"Anything for more presents!
"
4,17,Autumn,"""Hic"" Weh-hell, it's a Christmas party! Hey! You boys! You boys wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes?
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay?
"
4,17,Autumn,"But it's a Christmas party!
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Honey, can we go inside for a second?  Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until-  God-damnit!  Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! 
"
4,17,Stan,"Nobody's paying any attention. 
"
4,17,Woman,"Ew, I almost stepped in it.
"
4,17,Tele's Owner,"Well, it was a good effort, boys. But I'm gonna have to close shop. Nobody's buyin' anything an' I can't afford to keep this furnace runnin'!  Oh. And, boys, there's some crap on the sidewalk there. Watch out. 
"
4,17,Red,"Not one toy. I guess this yeear, everyone's content to celebrate with candles and love. 
"
4,17,Stan,"This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
"
4,17,News Anchor,"And in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially SICK OF CHRISTMAS!  In an SPC poll, 38% said they were fed up and tired of the holiday, 5% said they were indifferent to it, and a whopping 57% they would quick Bon Jovi square in the balls if given the opportunity. 
"
4,17,Ms. Choksondik,"Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh.  I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke.
"
4,17,Man,"You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate?
"
4,17,Man 2,"Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls.
"
4,17,News Anchor,"Well, the holiday spirit may be gone from South Park, but at least our faith in each other remains strong.
"
4,17,Assistant,"In South Park.
"
4,17,News Anchor,"Oh really?
"
4,17,Stan,"Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 
"
4,17,Charlie Brown,"Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree for our play.
"
4,17,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.
"
4,17,Stan,"How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
"
4,17,Charlie,"Alright, everyone, we've got to get on with our play!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
"
4,17,Stan,"And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
"
4,17,Cartman,"My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!
"
4,17,Stan,"What, dude?
"
4,17,Kyle,"We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! 
"
4,17,Stan,"We don't know anything about animation.
"
4,17,Kyle,"How hard can it be? Look at it. 
"
4,17,Cartman,"Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!
"
4,17,Kenny,"(Yeah, right! Awesome!)
"
4,17,Stan,"Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"" 
"
4,17,Mayor,"Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!
"
4,17,Aide 2,"Mayor, some adorable children are here to see you.
"
4,17,Mayor,"Meugh. Send them in.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
"
4,17,Mayor,"You do?
"
4,17,Kyle,"We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
"
4,17,Stan,"It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
"
4,17,Mayor,"An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!
"
4,17,The Boys,"Awww.
"
4,17,Mayor,"But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.
"
4,17,The Boys,"Alright!
"
4,17,Kyle,"You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase!  Don't you throw that vase! 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Ah, Mr. Hankey?
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Oh, Kyle! Hoowwddy ho!
"
4,17,Kyle,"We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.
"
4,17,The Nuggets,"Okay!
"
4,17,Autumn,"That's not the only thing we gotta get workin' again,  if you know what I mean...
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. 
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that projector workin'! Don't you worry! 
"
4,17,Amber,"What's the matter, Cornwallis?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.
"
4,17,Butters,"Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.
"
4,17,Stan,"Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
"
4,17,Butters,"Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus.  ""Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff"" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus.  ""Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff.""  ""Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose."" Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. 
"
4,17,The boys,"Whoa!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.
"
4,17,Stan,"That's not me, that's you!
"
4,17,Cartman,"What?!
"
4,17,Kyle,"They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
"
4,17,Cartman,"I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! 
"
4,17,Kyle,"God job, Butters.
"
4,17,Butters,"Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
"
4,17,Stan,"No, that's okay. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"See ya! 
"
4,17,Butters,"Uh-m, alright, alright then.  ""Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?""  ""Huh, Butters, ma'am.""   ""Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?""  ""Whoa! Well, uhuh""  ""Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again."" 
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in.
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"I don't want to, Dad. I'm too sad.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas.
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"It's not that, father. Its... Well, I don't feel like I'm really a part of Christmas.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!
"
4,17,Autumn,"Come on, it's time to sit around the tree!
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"We're having a talk, honey.
"
4,17,Autumn,"God-damnit it's Christmas and we're gonna be a happy family around the tree!
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up.
"
4,17,Autumn,"That's not the only thing that can't get up around here. 
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"...Now come on, son. Don't be so down.
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas isn't for us.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"I see the Nativity. There's angels, shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All the Christmas movies: Santa, elves, reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of it.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"No, you're not a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"I'm nothing but crap!
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"But crap is everything. 
Everything that lives on earth poos in some way
And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day
Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky
It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why
Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men
It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again
And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea.
And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal.
And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside
Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive
By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand
So it can spring to life and become food for the land!
It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe
It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass
''The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end
To make food for the humans and start all over again
You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life.
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"But how can I be that giraffe and blade of grass, and a human? I don't control what they do.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Just like your heart beats without you thinking about it, so, too, your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it. But it is all one life form. It is all...  you.
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"I think I see now.
I'm the poo of the antelope, that flows down to the ground
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Becomes the grass of tomorrow
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"Yeah
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Which the grazers turn around 
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"So I'm the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen
"
4,17,"Mr. Hankey, Cornwallis","Which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo again.
That's the Circle, the Circle of Poo!
"
4,17,Stan,"Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
"
4,17,Kyle,"No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. 
"
4,17,Sound man,"Okay, talk directly in the mike and don't hit any hard p's.
"
4,17,Kyle,"What's a hard p?
"
4,17,Cartman,"You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Oh, yeah.
"
4,17,Sound man,"Uumm, okay, sound is speeding, and...  
"
4,17,The boys,"We wish you a Merry Christmas
"
4,17,Sound man,"Hold on.
"
4,17,Kyle,"We wish- 
"
4,17,The boys,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
"
4,17,Cartman,"...deh..OOOWW!!!
"
4,17,Sound man,"Uh,  mmm. Okay, and? 
"
4,17,Boys,"We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas--
"
4,17,Stan,"Hey!  Wait a minute!
"
4,17,Kyle,"What?
"
4,17,Stan,"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Well, yes, I think so.
"
4,17,Stan,"Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--
"
4,17,Cartman,"Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Don't you oppress me, fat boy.
"
4,17,Cartman,"Don't call me fat, buttfucker.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
"
4,17,Stan,"You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 
"
4,17,Sound man,"Dude, that was awesome.
"
4,17,Stan,"What's awesome?
"
4,17,Sound man,"The script. It's sweet.
"
4,17,Stan,"That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
"
4,17,Sound man,"Well, it should be in the script. All that ""you're fat"" and ""you're a Jew"" and stuff. It's great. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
"
4,17,Stan,"Easy.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
"
4,17,Stan,"Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
"
4,17,Kyle,"Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.
"
4,17,Stan,"Okay.  One.
"
4,17,Kyle,"That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! 
"
4,17,Stan,"Kickass!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Now, the next mouth.
"
4,17,Stan,"Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Okay, where are the E-mouths?
"
4,17,Stan,"E mouths...
"
4,17,Kyle,"Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again?
"
4,17,Stan,"1  2.
"
4,17,Kyle,"So how much done is that?
"
4,17,Stan,"""We wish you a m- Merry""
"
4,17,Kyle,"Aw,  Jesus Christ!
"
4,17,Mayor,"This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year.
"
4,17,Johnson,"This... place is pretty run-down.
"
4,17,Mayor,"It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Hoowwddy ho!  Down here!
"
4,17,Johnson,"WAAGGH!
"
4,17,Mayor,"Oh. Mr. Hankey, it's you. How wonderful.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.
"
4,17,Autumn,"Hi there, Mr. Important Political Person. *hic*  You wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes and run naked through this parkin' lot?
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Uh-uh, honey, please don't start!
"
4,17,Autumn,"I didn't start it! He was looking at my breasts!
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"They're not real, you know.
"
4,17,Autumn,"Don't you say that! 
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn!
"
4,17,Johnson,"Uhhh, we'll just leave you to your cleanup. 
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work.
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"We can fix it up, Dad.
"
4,17,Amber,"Oh, look! A homeless person.  Oh. He looks sad, Papa.  There. That's better.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. 
"
4,17,Stan,"AAAAAAAA!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!
"
4,17,Stan,"That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Fine! We'll do it with out you!
"
4,17,Stan,"We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
"
4,17,Kyle,"We'll dub his voice over.
"
4,17,Stan,"Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!
"
4,17,Kyle,"You love-
"
4,17,Stan,"We love
"
4,17,Kyle,"-And I'll labor. 
"
4,17,Stan,"Tralala
"
4,17,Kyle,"You sit- 
"
4,17,Stan,"We sit.
"
4,17,Kyle,"-And I'll stand. 
"
4,17,Stan,"Tralalalala
"
4,17,Boys,"Get help from our next-door neighbor, 'cause 
"
4,17,"Boys, Hankeys","Even a miracle needs a hand! 
"
4,17,Kyle,"You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?
"
4,17,Stan,"""Awgh! I'm so fat!""
"
4,17,Kyle,"Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.
"
4,17,Stan,"""Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!""
"
4,17,Kyle,"Cool! Now let's try the script!
"
4,17,Sound Man,"Rolling...
"
4,17,Stan,"Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
"
4,17,Stan,"Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! 
"
4,17,Kyle,"You wish-
"
4,17,Stan,"We wish
"
4,17,Kyle,"-And I'll whittle.
"
4,17,Stan,"Tralalalala

"
4,17,Stan,"We sit.
"
4,17,Kyle,"-And I'll stand. 
"
4,17,Stan,"Tralalalala
"
4,17,Kyle,"Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 
"
4,17,Boys,"Even a miracle- 
"
4,17,Stan,"...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. 
"
4,17,"Stan, Kyle","Even a miracle needs a hand!! 
"
4,17,Mayor,"Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. 
"
4,17,Cartman,"Thank you, thank you. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
"
4,17,Cartman,"What are you talkin' about, ""quit""? Huh! I don't remember that.
"
4,17,Mayor,"We know that after you see this darling short film,  you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Okay, Mr. Hankey!
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"O-kay! 
"
4,17,Kids,"We wish you a merry Christmas,We wish you a merry Christmas,We wish you a merry Christmas--

4,17,Stan,"Hey!  Wait a minute!
"
4,17,Kyle,"What?
"
4,17,Stan,"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Yeah, I think so.
"
4,17,Stan,"(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
"
4,17,Kyle,"What?
"
4,17,Stan,"You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Dreidel dreidel dreidel-
"
4,17,Simon,"Eehhhh, pretty! 
"
4,17,Man,"Oh, that's Christmas for ya.
"
4,17,Mayor,"Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties.
"
4,17,Man 2,"Boring.
"
4,17,Man 3,"I've gotta go.
"
4,17,Man 4,"Stupid.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do!
"
4,17,Kyle,"All that hard work.
"
4,17,Mayor,"Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!
"
4,17,Kyle,"But we spent it!
"
4,17,Mayor,"Fine. Then we'll sue you.  Johnson? 
"
4,17,Aide,"I... used to believe in miracles. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"All that work!
"
4,17,Stan,"For nothing.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.
"
4,17,Cartman,"I guess- we might as well- go home now. 
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"But Dad, we can fix the projector.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap.
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"Dad, you taught me an important lesson: That crap is the cycle of everything.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'
"
4,17,Cornwallis,"No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because you showed me that I have the power and the strength to do anything I want. You made me believe in myself, Dad! Now I'm asking you to do the same.
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"Son...  You're the smartest piece of crap since Albert Poodinger! Come on! 
"
4,17,Sharon,"Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family.
"
4,17,Grandpa,"I wanna die. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"What the--
"
4,17,Kenny,"(Nooo!!) 
"
4,17,Kyle,"They did it! They got it working! 
"
4,17,Jesus,"You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle!
"
4,17,Santa,"I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.
"
4,17,Jesus,"Christmas is for celebrating my birth!
"
4,17,Santa,"Christmas is for giving!
"
4,17,Crowd,"Oh, wow!
"
4,17,Amber,"Mom! They got it working!
"
4,17,Autumn,"What's that? They got your father's penis workin' again? 
"
4,17,Kyle,"...We actually spokeâ€”to the Brian Boitano.
"
4,17,Stan,"Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.
"
4,17,Cartman,"Yeah, ham.
"
4,17,Stan,"No not ham!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.
"
4,17,Stan,"...Christmas is about something much more important!
"
4,17,Kyle,"What?
"
4,17,Stan,"Presents.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Ah.
"
4,17,Stan,"Don't you see, Kyle?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
4,17,Stan,"Presents.
"
4,17,Various Folk,"...Presents.
"
4,17,Man 5,"My God, they're right!
"
4,17,Mr. Mackey,"Christmas is about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay?
"
4,17,Randy,"That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
"
4,17,Mayor,"They're starting to understand, Johnson.
"
4,17,Ms. Choksondik,"We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive.
"
4,17,Mayor,"Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
"
4,17,Mr. Hankey,"No, you did it, boys!
"
4,17,Autumn,"Aw, hell, we all did it!
"
4,17,Mayor,"Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?
"
4,17,Stan,"Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
"
4,17,Cartman,"Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
"
4,17,Stan,"Wow! Count me in!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
"
4,17,Boys,"Dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made you out of clay
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
With dreidel I will play!
