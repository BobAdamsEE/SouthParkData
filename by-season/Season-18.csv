18,9,Gerald,"There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
"
18,9,Gerald,"It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
"
18,9,Kyle,"Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
"
18,9,Gerald,"All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Yes! 
"
18,9,Kyle,"Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
"
18,9,PewDiePie,"Aww, look at all the bright colors.
"
18,9,Ike,"...Meh. 
"
18,9,Kyle,"Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
"
18,9,Ike,"Maybe later, 'kay?
"
18,9,Kyle,"Well what are you watching?
"
18,9,PewDiePie,"How's it goin' bros? My name's PewDiePie. I'm playing Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Here we go.  Agh! People are shooting at me, bros!
"
18,9,Kyle,"You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
"
18,9,Ike,"PewDiePie!
"
18,9,PewDiePie,"There's lots of bullet! And I've gotta run! RUN FOR THE BUNKER! RUUUUN!
"
18,9,Kyle,"Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
"
18,9,PewDiePie,"All right, I hope that's enough.
"
18,9,Ike,"Meh.
"
18,9,PewDiePie,"Uh, like I said, um... Look at this. Look at this. Ooohhh, gigrrig! 
"
18,9,Kyle,"Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
"
18,9,Butters,"What's a PewDiePie do?
"
18,9,Kyle,"Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
"
18,9,Cartman,"He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
"
18,9,Kyle,"Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
"
18,9,Announcer,"This Saturday, at the Pepsi Center, it's Women of Rock! Miley Cyrus, Iggy Azalea, Nicki Minaj, and Lorde!  All on one stage, on one night! With a special appearance by Michael Jackson's Hologram!
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"Hee hee!
"
18,9,Announcer,"Ticket proceeds help fight the gluten crisis in West Africa! It's a night of pure, pure estrogen! Tickets on sale now! 
"
18,9,Randy,"Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!
"
18,9,Record Executive,"Come on, this is a great lineup.
"
18,9,Randy,"Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
"
18,9,Record Executive,"I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig.
"
18,9,Randy,"What is that supposed to mean?
"
18,9,Record Executive,"I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada.
"
18,9,Randy,"Yes, Freemium gaming.
"
18,9,Record Executive,"I'm sorry. Freemium gaming destroys lives. I lost my father to Candy Crush.  You need this, Lorde. And the girls out there need you. You've got till tomorrow to think it over. 
"
18,9,Randy,"I love Candy Crush.
"
18,9,Kyle,"All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
18,9,Stan,"I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
18,9,Kyle,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
"
18,9,Kenny,"(Commentary?)
"
18,9,Kyle,"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 
"
18,9,Cartman,"Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. 
"
18,9,Kyle,"All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
18,9,Cartman,"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
"
18,9,Stan,"I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
"
18,9,Kyle,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
"
18,9,Kenny,"(Commentary?)
"
18,9,Cartman,"There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!
"
18,9,Kyle,"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
"
18,9,Shelly,"Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! 
"
18,9,Sharon,"I don't know, Shelly.
"
18,9,Shelly,"But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! 
"
18,9,Randy,"Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
"
18,9,Shelly,"She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!
"
18,9,Randy,"And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
"
18,9,Shelley,"That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything!
"
18,9,Randy,"You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
"
18,9,Shelly,"So can I go or not?!
"
18,9,Randy,"If she means that much to you.
"
18,9,Shelly,"Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys. 
"
18,9,Sharon,"Sooo you're doing it? 
"
18,9,Randy,"How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
"
18,9,Sharon,"Of course not.  Anything to keep you away from cock magic.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
"
18,9,Cartman,"More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
"
18,9,Kyle,"All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
18,9,Cartman,"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
"
18,9,Kyle,"What the fuck?!
"
18,9,Stan,"I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
"
18,9,Cartman,"God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!
"
18,9,Kyle,"But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
"
18,9,Ike,"CartmaaanBrah!
"
18,9,Kyle,"What do you think you're doing?!
"
18,9,Cartman,"Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
"
18,9,Kyle,"You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
"
18,9,Cartman,"I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
"
18,9,Kyle,"I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
"
18,9,Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
18,9,Kyle,"This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
"
18,9,Cartman,"Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Let's Plays?
"
18,9,Cartman,"That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. 
"
18,9,Miley Cyrus,"There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
Throw my hands in the air while I'm twerkin' this chair
There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
And I'm movin' my hands while I'm shakin' my tits.
"
18,9,Stagehand,"Alright guys, Uh, Miley's about to finish up her set. So next we'll need you, Nicki Minaj, then Iggy Azalea who'll be performing with a hologram of Michael Jackson, and then finally you, Lorde.  Have a great show, ladies.
"
18,9,Randy,"Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
"
18,9,Record Executive,"You're nervous, it's understandable.
"
18,9,Randy,"No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
"
18,9,Record Executive,"You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit.
"
18,9,Randy,"Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
"
18,9,Iggy,"Oh fuck you, Lorde! You think you're so much better than everyone!
"
18,9,Randy,"No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
"
18,9,Iggy,"That's easy for you to say because YOU don't have a nice body! Is that why you're so high and mighty, Lorde?! Because you're jealous of this booty?!
"
18,9,Randy,"Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.
"
18,9,Iggy,"'Cause let's face it! You got legs that look like a horse!
"
18,9,Randy,"Fuck you! 
"
18,9,Record Executive,"Alright that's enough!  Look at yourselves!
"
18,9,Iggy,"You're an Internet bullshit artist, Lorde!
"
18,9,Stan,"Hey, what's up?
"
18,9,Kyle,"You're not gonna believe this.
"
18,9,Stan,"Oh no, what now?
"
18,9,Kyle,"I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
"
18,9,Stan,"Yeah?
"
18,9,Kyle,"Come on! 
"
18,9,PewDiePie,"He's just laying there.
"
18,9,Kyle,"See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
"
18,9,PewDiePie,"I'm going ""Dun dun dadadun dun dadadun.""
"
18,9,Kids,"PewDiePie!
"
18,9,Kyle,"And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
"
18,9,Butters,"Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!
"
18,9,Kids,"CartmanBrah!
"
18,9,Stan,"Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
"
18,9,Conner,"Okay Grandpa, we'll be sure to keep that in mind. 
"
18,9,Stan,"Grandpa?
"
18,9,Kyle,"This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
"
18,9,Kid 1,"Yeah Conner, we're supposed to respect our elders, remember?
"
18,9,Kid 2,"It's best to just make old people think they matter.
"
18,9,Stan,"Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
"
18,9,Kid 2,"No sir. Thank goodness we have you to do that. 
"
18,9,Stan,"We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
"
18,9,PewDiePie,"Oh my God I killed him!
"
18,9,Iggy,"Missy who who?
That's all I do is rip off Missy.
Missy who?
Missy who? Missy who? Missy who who? Missy who who?
Alright bitches and hos, via hologram and shit, Michael Jackson! 
"
18,9,Tech 1,"And, cue the hologram! 
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"Hee hee. 
"
18,9,Randy,"They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
"
18,9,Nicki,"Oh Lorde, you're such a purist.
"
18,9,Randy,"Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.
"
18,9,Wendy,"Hi everybody. I love you!
"
18,9,Audience,"Thanks for loving me. I love you too.
"
18,9,Wendy,"So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy??  Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! 
"
18,9,Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah!
"
18,9,Wendy,"So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
"
18,9,Cartman,"Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.
"
18,9,Wendy,"And why do you think young people-?
"
18,9,Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah!
"
18,9,Wendy,"...Why do you think young people are responding to this?  I'm asking you a question! 
"
18,9,Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
"
18,9,MC,"And now, give it up for the girl from New Zealand, LORDE!
"
18,9,Randy,"Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!  Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya.  Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy.  Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya.  And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh.  Oh God. Sorry.  Uh hold on. Hang on, uh. 
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"Hee hee.  I'm free! I'm free!
"
18,9,Randy,"Sorry folks, just one second here.
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"Hee hee. Dah dadit dat ja!
"
18,9,Guard 1,"Stop him. 
"
18,9,Guard 1,"Michael Jackson's hologram is on the loose!
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"Hee hee!
"
18,9,Randy,"Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Okay, uh, uh...  Oooo! Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! 
"
18,9,Fan,"Ogh! Lorde, ewww!
"
18,9,Randy,"Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! 
"
18,9,Randy,"Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Great, thanks.  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?
"
18,9,Stan,"Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
"
18,9,Randy,"I was told to!
"
18,9,Sharon,"You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.
"
18,9,Randy,"Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! 
"
18,9,Kyle,"It's dying. The living room is... dying.
"
18,9,Randy,"Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?
"
18,9,Record Executive,"What are you talking about? It's great! You're the most commented-on artist in the world right now! You're blowing up twitter and you're trending on CartmanBrah. #clitnubbin
"
18,9,Randy,"Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-
"
18,9,Record Executive,"It's not about the music, Lorde! It never was. It's about comments! And sister, you've got 'em!
"
18,9,Randy,"This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
"
18,9,Passenger,"Will you look at that? Everyone on their cell phones, nobody sayin' a word to each other. Call me a grandpa, but I still like commenting face to face with folks. You know what I mean, buddy?
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"Yes.
"
18,9,Passenger,"You're headin' up to the mountains too, huh? Gonna do some skiin'?
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"No, I just need to... take care of some im-, important business.
"
18,9,Passenger,"Oh, what kind of business? Oh are you a fisherman?
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"Yes. I mean, yes, that's all. I'm, I'm just gonna fish and hunt.
"
18,9,Passenger,"Oh, you're a hunter? What do you prey upon?
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"Nobody! That's ignorant!
"
18,9,Passenger,"Well, you must have a favorite kind of prey?
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"Allegedly! Allegedly! That's ignorant!
"
18,9,Passenger,"You know, excuse me for saying so, but you seem kind of... transparent.
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"...That's ignorant. I'm just cold.
"
18,9,Passenger,"I'm saying it must make it easier to sneak up on your prey.
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"Allegedly! I'm weary of this conversation! Can we please stop talking, please?! Ignorant!
"
18,9,Passenger,"Well, whatever it is you're after, I hope you get it.
"
18,9,MJ Hologram,"Oh I will. Trust me, I will. 
"
18,9,Tech 2,"Ah, we've lost any ability to track the hologram's location. Ih...it looks like it reprogrammed its guidance systems.
"
18,9,Record Executive,"We paid a lot of money for that hologram. You'd better find a way to get it back!
"
18,9,Tech 3,"Project Alpha?
"
18,9,Tech 4,"Yes. That might be our only option.
"
18,9,Record Executive,"What is Project Alpha?
"
18,9,Tech 4,"The first hologram we ever created to appear on stage. It was a prototype. But perhaps the best thing to stop a hologram-
"
18,9,Tech 3,"Is another hologram. Bring up Project Alpha!
"
18,9,Tech 2,"Sir, are you sure that we wanna-?
"
18,9,Tech 3,"Bring it up! 
"
18,9,Record Executive,"What is that?
"
18,9,Tech 3,"Tupac.
"
18,9,Tech 4,"Tupac?  Yo. The hologram of Michael Jackson is on the loose. We need you to ""take care of the situation."" 
"
18,9,Tech 3,"Godspeed, Tupac.
"
18,9,Man,"Oh my gosh, honey look it's Tupac! I told you them homies didn't cap his ass!  Oh, this is going on Instagram! 
"
18,9,Cartman,"Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now.  Yep, there's Kyle, Stan andn Kenny looking stupid as ever.
"
18,9,Kyle,"I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
"
18,9,Stan,"Tell me about it.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!
"
18,9,Kyle,"You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Oh God.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Do you mind?!
"
18,9,Cartman,"Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
"
18,9,Kyle,"Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
"
18,9,Cartman,"Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
"
18,9,Randy,"Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. 
"
18,9,Record Executive,"Sit down, Lorde.
"
18,9,Randy,"I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
"
18,9,Record Executive,"Do you know what an artist is now, Lorde? An artist is a conversation piece, nothing more.  Like a vase, or a kitschy side table. Just something for people to comment on.  The old ways are dying. We're not making money off records, we're making money off tweets. And you've taken it to a whole new level.
"
18,9,Randy,"Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
"
18,9,Record Executive,"On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about.
"
18,9,Randy,"I'll do no such thing!
"
18,9,Record Executive,"Who said anything about you? 
"
18,9,Randy,"You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
"
18,9,Record Executive,"Today, commentary IS the content. And you, I'm afraid, are just in the way. 
"
18,9,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle.
"
18,9,Kyle,"What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
"
18,9,Cartman,"Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake.
"
18,9,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell is that?
"
18,9,Kyle,"It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
"
18,9,Cartman,"Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!
"
18,9,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell?
"
18,9,Cartman,"This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
"
18,9,Butters,"It's true!
"
18,9,Cartman,"Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
"
18,9,Butters,"Heheyehah.
"
18,9,Kyle,"There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
"
18,9,Cartman,"There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!
"
18,9,Mr. Garrison,"I don't- I don't even understand what's happening.
"
18,9,Kyle,"THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
"
18,9,Cartman,"This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.
"
18,9,Mr. Mackey,"Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office!
"
18,9,Cartman,"What the hell did I do?
"
18,9,Principal Victoria,"Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
"
18,9,Principal Victoria,"Eric, I am talking to YOU!
"
18,9,Cartman,"Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
"
18,9,Randy,"Sharon? Sharon!
"
18,9,Sharon,"Randy? What's going on?
"
18,9,Randy,"They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!
"
18,9,Sharon,"Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?
"
18,9,Randy,"The hologram's in our bedroom?
"
18,9,Sharon,"Yes!
"
18,9,Tupac's Hologram,"I've gotta be leavin' now, Sharon. I would leave you my number but I'm just a hologram 'n shit.
"
18,9,Randy,"You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!
"
18,9,Record Executive,"It's a brave new world, starting much sooner than we thought. What we need is someone who truly gets the changing of the guard. We have an army of holograms poised to start the next chapter in American culture. How would you like to be in charge of it all?
"
18,9,Cartman,"Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah!
"
18,9,Record Executive,"Glad you feel that way. We have a lot to do together. We're about to take this to a whole new level.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome! CartmaaanBrah!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.
"
18,1,Stan,"Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Barking vaginal belch.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Protruding vaginal boner.
"
18,1,Kenny,"(Dilapidated titties incorporated.)
"
18,1,Cartman,"Oh, I like that. 
"
18,1,Butters,"Rotten boobie turds!
"
18,1,Stan,"Nah.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Bloody butt cough.
"
18,1,Stan,"Uh huh.
"
18,1,Stan,"Angry Clit Spasm
"
18,1,Registrar,"Nope, sorry.
"
18,1,Stan,"Whooping Fart Balls.
"
18,1,Registrar,"Nnnnnope.
"
18,1,Stan,"Lubricated Titty Burgers.
"
18,1,Registrar,"That's taken too.
"
18,1,Stan,"Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge!
"
18,1,Registrar,"Sorry.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
"
18,1,Kyle,"How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
"
18,1,Registrar,"I told you, you just have to be really original with with your company name. There's a lot of startup company these days. 
"
18,1,Cartman,"Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
"
18,1,Registrar,"That's available! Congratulations!
"
18,1,Kyle,"It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
"
18,1,Stan,"Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
"
18,1,Butters,"Man this sucks!
"
18,1,Randy,"Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?
"
18,1,Stan,"No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
"
18,1,Randy,"A startup company? A company that does what?
"
18,1,Stan,"No, we don't wanna do anything.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
"
18,1,Butters,"Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
"
18,1,Randy,"Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
"
18,1,Stan,"...Nnnno, there isn't. 
"
18,1,Cartman,"You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it!
"
18,1,Stan,"What?
"
18,1,Cartman,"It's the greatest startup company name EVER! 
"
18,1,Kyle,"What?! Tell us!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Washington. Redskins. 
"
18,1,Kyle,"Washington Redskins?
"
18,1,Cartman,"It's sooo sweet!
"
18,1,Stan,"I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.
"
18,1,Cartman,"It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
"
18,1,Stan,"Washington Redskins.  I like it!
"
18,1,Kenny,"(Me too!)
"
18,1,Kyle,"What?!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
"
18,1,Kyle,"Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
"
18,1,Stan,"You alright dude?
"
18,1,Kyle,"Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
"
18,1,Cartman,"It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
"
18,1,Cartman,"We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.
"
18,1,Kyle,"I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
"
18,1,Butters,"We already got a dollar!
"
18,1,Stan,"What?! 
"
18,1,Butters,"One dollar pledge!
"
18,1,Kenny,"(Yahoo!) 
"
18,1,Cartman,"I told you guys! ""Washington Redskins"" totally gets people's attention!
"
18,1,Butters,"Another two dollars!
"
18,1,Kyle,"No way!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Sittin' on our asses, here we come!
"
18,1,News 4 Anchor,"Another new startup company is gaining a lot of attention on the Internet. They're a company that does absolutely nothing, and they're called, the Washington Redskins.  The Redskins started as what appeared to be some kind of adolescent prank, but almost overnight it has become one of the most heavily funded projects on Kickstarter.  Why did you give five dollars to the Washington Redskins Kickstarter?
"
18,1,Teen Boy,"I dunno, I just. Uh. They don't do anything, that's pretty sweet. I dunno, I thought it was funny.
"
18,1,Cartman,"By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.
"
18,1,News 4 Anchor,"It's called crowd-funding, using the Internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors, a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.
"
18,1,Businessman,"You are Eric Cartman?
"
18,1,Cartman,"Yes, I know.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"My name is Dan Snyder. I'm the president and owner of the Washington Redskins
"
18,1,Cartman,"Oh, cool. Please take a seat.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Thank you, but I will stand.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Nice, I like that.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Young man, we ask that you please stop using the name Washington Redskins for your organization.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Stop? But why?
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Because we are the Washington Redskins, and we are a football team! You have NO right to use our name to get attention!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that?
"
18,1,Butters,"Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Look! Don't you see that when you call your organization ""The Washington Redskins"", its offensive to us?
"
18,1,Cartman,"How is it offensive?
"
18,1,Coach,"How is it offensive?! Jesus, what-?!
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"We are a proud team, Mr. Cartman! We have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing!
"
18,1,Coach,"Makes us feel like a joke
"
18,1,Cartman,"Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company ""Washington Redskins,"" it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Uh, I know I can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency?
"
18,1,Cartman,"Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. 
"
18,1,Flight attendant,"All around the world, people are saying they are inspired by the Washington Redskins. The Internet startup company has raised so much money in Kickstarter that now, more groups are doing the same.
"
18,1,Reporter,"More news on the Washington Redskins tonight. Their defiant. F-You attitude has now caught the attention of the terrorist group ISIS. The terrorists said they admire the Washington Redskins and want to try it and follow their business model.
"
18,1,A caller,"Well, let's not forget, Marsha that there's a people here, okay, who are not happy about the use of the name, the Football Washington Redskins!
"
18,1,Woman,"Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them? 
"
18,1,Cartman,"Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
"
18,1,Kyle,"Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
"
18,1,Kyle,"People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!
"
18,1,Kyle,"That's the Catholic Church!
"
18,1,Cartman,"NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
"
18,1,Kyle,"That's the NFL!
"
18,1,Cartman,"It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
"
18,1,Butters,"Oh no!
"
18,1,Kyle,"All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
"
18,1,Kyle,"Maybe I'll start my own company.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Well that's fine! You can't call yourself ""Washington Redskins!""
"
18,1,Kyle,"I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 
"
18,1,Cartman,"Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
"
18,1,Kyle,"Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
"
18,1,Stan,"I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. 
"
18,1,Butters,"Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to ISIS. You have to do something, Commissioner Goodell! What are you going to do about this?!
"
18,1,Goodell,"I will get it right, and do whatever is necessary to accomplish that.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"What?!
"
18,1,Goodell,"We will continue to identify and add expertise to our team.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"That's the most ridiculous nothing answer I've ever heard! What are you gonna do now?!
"
18,1,Goodell,"Everyone will participate in educating sessions starting in the next month.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Ugh! This thing is broken!
"
18,1,Goodell,"We can add... and we will do more, do more, do more 
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Get all the NFL owners on Skype! This thing is broken again!
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"And so I call upon the help of all owners. You cannot let my people be belittled like this!
"
18,1,Jim Irsay,"Dan, you don't wanna be dealin' with this stuff. Let the Goodell-bot do it.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"The stupid thing isn't working!
"
18,1,Goodell,"I will get it right.
"
18,1,Steve Bischiotti,"Man, that thing hasn't worked right since we bought it.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Look, my team is starting to lose hope. You have to use your influence to make these people change their name.
"
18,1,Paul Allen,"Did you tell them we're about honor and integrity?
"
18,1,Alex Spanos,"If the Goodell bot is broken, we must stay out of it more than even usual!
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"And so I'm alone? What if they ridicule the 49ers team next? Or make fun of Jerry Jones because his eyes are too far apart?
"
18,1,Jerry Jones,"My eyes aren't too far apart!
"
18,1,Paul Allen,"If we get them to change their logo, will it make you happy?
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Uh I guess we can live with that.
"
18,1,Jim Irsay,"Then it is decided! We will make them change their logo. Begin mas behind-the-scenes under-the-table enforcement of our wishes NOW
"
18,1,Owners,"Go! 
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Thank God!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! ""Fuck you."" Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name ""Redskins"", they will immediately think ""titties"" and ""balls"". It's just a bold new way that we can say ""We don't fucking care."" Go Redskins! 
"
18,1,Kyle,"It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
"
18,1,Stan,"Yeah...
"
18,1,Kyle,"You okay, bro?
"
18,1,Stan,"I just... never saw myself owning a company called ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC.""
"
18,1,Kyle,"Give it time, it'll grow on you.
"
18,1,Stan,"Why don't we just call it ""Untitled Startup Company""?
"
18,1,Kyle,"Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
"
18,1,Stan,"Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Well whattaya mean?
"
18,1,Stan,"I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table"" is holding you back. 
"
18,1,Stan,"Good luck with your company, dude.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Yeah. Good luck with yours. 
"
18,1,Employee,"It's just... incredible, Harry. Everyone is using Kickstarter for everything!
"
18,1,Harry,"And for every project funded, we get 5%.
"
18,1,Employee,"It's like, we don't even have to do anything and we just make money.
"
18,1,Harry,"Sitting on our asses, here we come.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Caw-CAW, Caw-CAW.  HooHOO, hoohooHOO. 
"
18,1,Employee 2,"Huh? 
"
18,1,Cartman,"Goooood morning, guys!
"
18,1,Butters,"Happy Deadline Day!
"
18,1,Cartman,"We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
"
18,1,Butters,"Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!
"
18,1,Cartman,"What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
"
18,1,Butters,"It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
"
18,1,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
18,1,Butters,"Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
"
18,1,Cartman,"What?!
"
18,1,Butters,"Somebody killed Kickstarter!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
"
18,1,Kyle,"What the hell is wrong? ""Can't find the server"" Kickstarter. 
"
18,1,Cartman,"You song of a bitch!
"
18,1,Kyle,"What?!
"
18,1,Cartman,"You broke Kickstarter!
"
18,1,Kyle,"No, I just can't get it to load.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
"
18,1,Kyle,"My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Well, somebody did!
"
18,1,Stan,"It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
"
18,1,Kyle,"He's right. We should do a merger.
"
18,1,Cartman,"A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! 
"
18,1,Kyle,"Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
"
18,1,Cartman,"It is really sweet.
"
18,1,Stan,"And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
"
18,1,Butters,"Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
"
18,1,Kyle,"Whattaya say, Cartman?
"
18,1,Cartman,"Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.
"
18,1,Kyle,"When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
"
18,1,Cartman,"You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest ""fuck you"" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. 
"
18,1,Cartman and Kyle,"Go Redskins!
"
18,1,Announcer,"A beautiful night in Arlington, Texas as the Dallas Cowboys get set to take on the Washington Redskins. That is, of course, Washington Redskins the football team, not Washington Redskins, the audacious crowd-funding company.
"
18,1,Commentator,"Yeah, and if you ask me, the Redskins are a scam.
"
18,1,Announcer,"You're talking about the crowd-funding company- Redskins, right?
"
18,1,Commentator,"That's right. An-and now you've got terrorist groups like ISIS using the Redskins to raise their money. I-I don't like what the Redskins are doing.
"
18,1,Announcer,"Those Redskins
"
18,1,Commentator,"Yeah, whatever.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"No. No, we cannot give up! We have been through too much together. We have fought Eagle, and Bear! The Eagles only beat us by three points.
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Don't let them break you! Don't let them win! 
"
18,1,Announcer,"And the Cowboys are still set to kick off, but there doesn't seem to be anyone to kick off to.
"
18,1,Commentator,"Yeah, and Jerry Jones must be happy this means a forfeit, another win for the Cowboys. 
"
18,1,Announcer,"Wait a minute, it appears a lone Redskin is making his way out of the locker room.  The Cowboys kick it off. 
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Hut! Hut Hut Hut!  Hut hut hut. Hut Hut Hut Hut!  Hut. Hut hut hut. Hut Hut! 
"
18,1,Crowd,"Oh!
"
18,1,Fan wearing #3,"Just stay down! For the love of God!
"
18,1,Dan Snyder,"Hut hut. Hut! 
"
18,1,Fan wearing #74,"Stop! Make it stop!
"
18,1,Fan wearing #82,"Just stay down!
"
18,1,Another fan,"Please!
"
18,1,Fan wearing a blue star,"Just make him stay down!
"
18,1,Other fans,"Go Redskins! Go Redskins!
"
18,1,Stan,"Boy, this is the life, huh guys?
"
18,1,Butters,"We finally did it!
"
18,1,Cartman,"I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. 
"
18,1,Kyle,"What the heck is that? 
"
18,1,Cartman,"Whoa, whoa! What?
"
18,1,Protestor #1,"Change your name!
"
18,1,Protestor #2,"It doesn't belong in today's society!
"
18,1,Kyle,"Change our name?
"
18,1,Stan,"But you all thought our name was sweet.
"
18,1,Protestor #3,"There's nothing sweet about a people who were decimated. A once proud nation that finally lost hope and left their leader to be massacred by Cowboys in a defiant last stand!
"
18,1,Kyle,"When was that?
"
18,1,Protestor #4,"Last night.
"
18,1,Protestor #5,"Until you change your name, we are asking all your subscribers to boycott you.
"
18,1,ISIS Spokesman,"That's right! ISIS will no longer use your insensitive company for its fundraising!
"
18,1,Crowd,"Yeah! Alright!
"
18,1,Protestor #1,"Good for you, ISIS!
"
18,1,Kyle,"Well what the hell do we do?
"
18,1,Cartman,"I guess we gotta go back to school. 
"
18,2,Kyle,"Hey guys!
"
18,2,Stan,"Morning!
"
18,2,Cartman,"How's it going, everybody?
"
18,2,Kyle,"Sup, Jason? 
"
18,2,Cartman,"Hey dude. Sup? 
"
18,2,Craig,"What are you guys doing here?
"
18,2,Cartman,"What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
"
18,2,Jimmy,"I thought you guys said you didn't need school.
"
18,2,Token,"Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.
"
18,2,Kyle,"Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
"
18,2,Craig,"But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
"
18,2,Craig,"You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves.
"
18,2,Kyle,"We were- trying to be funny.
"
18,2,Jimmy,"Yeah well, no one's laughing, Kyle. 
"
18,2,Stan,"Hey Wendy.
"
18,2,Wendy,"You're... back?
"
18,2,Stan,"Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
"
18,2,Wendy,"Oh wow, I'm shocked.
"
18,2,Stan,"So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
"
18,2,Wendy,"You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be ""free to chase your dreams"".
"
18,2,Stan,"Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
"
18,2,Wendy,"Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be  ""dripping in bitches""?!
"
18,2,Stan,"Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 
"
18,2,Wendy,"I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! 
"
18,2,Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at us.
"
18,2,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)
"
18,2,Kyle,"Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore?
"
18,2,Cartman,"Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
"
18,2,Kyle,"Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
"
18,2,Pricipal Victoria,"All right everyone, thanks for coming. As you know, we urgently need to discuss the matter of Butters Stotch, who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back. Are we all set to start?
"
18,2,Woman,"Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.
"
18,2,Mr. Adler,"Awww, do we need Mackey here?
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing.
"
18,2,Principal Victoria,"Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.
"
18,2,Mr. Adler,"He doesn't look any different to me.
"
18,2,Principal Victoria,"In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"It's just the new diet fad! 
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay?
"
18,2,Principal Victoria,"Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?
"
18,2,Principal Victoria,"Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"That's probably gluten, m'kay?
"
18,2,Coach,"Oh, God!
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems,
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off.
"
18,2,Principal Victoria,"Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.
"
18,2,Kyle,"I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
"
18,2,Kenny,"(Right. What the fuck is going on?)
"
18,2,Cartman,"You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party
"
18,2,Kenny,"(A party?!)
"
18,2,Cartman,"Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
"
18,2,Kyle,"Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
"
18,2,Kyle,"Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...
"
18,2,Stan,"For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
"
18,2,Cartman,"What?
"
18,2,Kyle,"No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
"
18,2,Cartman,"We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
"
18,2,Kyle,"A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
"
18,2,Stan,"Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
"
18,2,Kenny,"(This will be awesome!)
"
18,2,Cartman,"So who do we throw the party for?
"
18,2,Stan,"What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 
"
18,2,DJ,"All right, that was ""Get This Party Started"" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys?
"
18,2,Kyle,"Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.
"
18,2,Cartman,"You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
"
18,2,DJ,"Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct?
"
18,2,Cartman,"You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
"
18,2,Stan,"Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
"
18,2,DJ,"Must be pretty special having a big party in your honor, Scott. How does it feel?
"
18,2,Scott,"I actually have plans this weekend.
"
18,2,Cartman,"""I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes.""
"
18,2,DJ,"All right, well, we've got lots of people callin' in. Caller, what's your question?
"
18,2,Craig,"Are you guys making this up?
"
18,2,Kyle,"Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
"
18,2,Craig,"All the pizza we can eat?
"
18,2,Cartman,"Believe it, dude.
"
18,2,Craig,"All right, this better be good.
"
18,2,DJ,"All right, it's sure to be a blast. Phone lines are going craaazy!
"
18,2,Stan,"Sweet!
"
18,2,DJ,"Next caller, what's your question?
"
18,2,Principal Victoria,"Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?
"
18,2,Stan,"Excuse me?
"
18,2,Principal Victoria,"Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.
"
18,2,DJ,"Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment?
"
18,2,Mark,"Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like ""Get your second-hand gluten away from me!""
"
18,2,DJ,"All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys?
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face.
"
18,2,Cartman,"What the hell is gluten?
"
18,2,John Garner,"Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight.
"
18,2,Randy,"Make your dick fly off?
"
18,2,John Garner,"People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that's a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say ""Well there's fat in butter too,"" but that's just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten?
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yes, thank you!
"
18,2,John Garner,"Simply put, gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away. . Flour is of course, just wheat, and when you add a liquid to flour, you get dough.  Dough that makes breads, doughnuts, pasta, and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy.  Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distil the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we're left with is pure gluten. Not a bio-weapon, just harmless flour protein.
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"Then eat it!
"
18,2,John Garner,"Excuse me?
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?
"
18,2,John Garner,"Yeah. Alright.  Dup, dup. 
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off. 
"
18,2,Stephen,"Oh my God! These people don't even know!  Hurry! You gotta go!
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there!  Get out of there!
"
18,2,Stephen,"Get out! You're not safe!
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"You gotta get out!
"
18,2,Stephen,"Hurry! You gotta go!
"
18,2,Randy,"What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?
"
18,2,Sharon,"Yes!
"
18,2,Randy,"Hamburger Helper?
"
18,2,Sharon,"That's all gluten!
"
18,2,Randy,"There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!
"
18,2,Sharon,"Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.
"
18,2,Randy,"Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!
"
18,2,Sharon,"It's in the Triscuits too, Randy!
"
18,2,Stan,"Wait, wait, ah I might need those.
"
18,2,Randy,"This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!
"
18,2,Sharon,"Don't forget the freezer!
"
18,2,Randy,"Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!
"
18,2,Sharon,"I don't know! Look at the ingredients!
"
18,2,Randy,"Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!
"
18,2,Sharon,"All right, that's all of it!
"
18,2,Randy,"You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!
"
18,2,Sharon,"I can get both of these, yeah!
"
18,2,Randy,"All right, come on! 
"
18,2,Kyle,"Hey Cartman.
"
18,2,Cartman,"KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
"
18,2,Kyle,"Dude, calm down.
"
18,2,Cartman,"THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
"
18,2,Kyle,"Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
"
18,2,Cartman,"KYYYLE!
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!
"
18,2,Farmer,"What are you doing to my farm?!?
"
18,2,Randy,"You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! 
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"There's panic all over the country and you're telling me you don't have any kind of containment on this thing?!
"
18,2,Researcher,"We're working as fast as we can, sir.
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"Are you sure it's gluten that started the reaction?
"
18,2,Researcher,"We gave these rats an injection of concentrated whole wheat bread just a short time ago. You can see it already having a negative effect. 
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"We told people that whole wheat bread was healthy! Isn't wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy?
"
18,2,Researcher,"No. We believe now that that's poppycock.
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"All right, listen up! We have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isn't safe to eat. We are the USDA! Without us, people would be eating dirt and... chairs. Whatever it takes, stop this crisis! 
"
18,2,Kyle,"Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
"
18,2,Cartman,"What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
"
18,2,Stan,"We can't let our party suck.
"
18,2,Cartman,"What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
"
18,2,Kyle,"That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
"
18,2,Stan,"I'll be back. 
"
18,2,Cartman,"You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
"
18,2,Kyle,"Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
"
18,2,Cartman,"There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
"
18,2,Randy,"Yes?
"
18,2,Worker 1,"Hello, sir. We've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home. May we come in?
"
18,2,Randy,"Gluten expohn... oh not here!
"
18,2,Worker 2,"Can we come in please?
"
18,2,Randy,"Wuh sure! 
"
18,2,Sharon,"What's going on? 
"
18,2,Randy,"Well that's just a beer.
"
18,2,Worker 1,"Oh Jesus.
"
18,2,Shelly,"BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!
"
18,2,Randy,"Shuut up,  beer is bad for you?!
"
18,2,Worker 2,"We're gonna need you to come with us, sir. Don't touch me.
"
18,2,Randy,"Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?
"
18,2,Worker 1,"We just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on.
"
18,2,Randy,"No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
"
18,2,Randy,"How long do I have to stay here?!
"
18,2,Soldier,"Until the USDA gets control of the situation, sir.
"
18,2,Randy,"What am I supposed to eat?
"
18,2,Soldier,"It's okay, there's lots of toppings. Just eat the toppings. 
"
18,2,A Quarantine,"How'd you get exposed?  Bagels? Gravy?
"
18,2,Randy,"Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce.  Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.
"
18,2,Jeff,"We're trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there, but... It seems impossible to contain.
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"And we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves?
"
18,2,Researcher,"We've been running simulations, but they're problematic because they don't relate to our current schematics. Here, look. This is what we've been recommending for the past three years.  Five basic food groups, not four. We were wrong about that. We now realize, of course, that the largest of these groups we've been recommending is basically poison . Sir, to combat the gluten, we're trying every possible combination of the four remaining food groups, but so far, no answers.
"
18,2,Agent,"Sir, the feds are here.
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"Oh shit!
"
18,2,FDA Agent 1,"Tom Vilsack?
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"Yes?
"
18,2,Michael Taylor,"Michael Taylor, FDA.
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"Yeah, thank you, but this is a USDA problem.
"
18,2,Michael Taylor,"Anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too!
"
18,2,Stan,"Dad? Dad!
"
18,2,Randy,"Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
"
18,2,Stan,"Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
"
18,2,Randy,"I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?
"
18,2,Stan,"Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
"
18,2,Randy,"How's your mom? Your, your sister?
"
18,2,Soldier 2,"This is a quarantined area, kid. You're you're gonna have to go.
"
18,2,Stan,"Nonono, not yet. DAD!
"
18,2,Randy,"That's my son, you bastard!
"
18,2,Soldier 2,"I'm sorry, all right?
"
18,2,Stan,"Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
"
18,2,Randy,"Staaan!
"
18,2,Stan,"Let me talk to my dad! 
"
18,2,Randy,"Staaaaaaan!
"
18,2,Craig,"You call this a party?! Your party sucks!
"
18,2,Token,"Come on guys, let's go!
"
18,2,Jimmy,"No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped! 
"
18,2,Aunt Jemima,"Hello, Eric.  Come on over here, sugar.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Aunt Jemima. 
"
18,2,Aunt Jemima,"There's people in trouble, Eric. They need to be shown the way.
"
18,2,Cartman,"I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.
"
18,2,Aunt Jemima,"You need to get to the USDA, child. They're lookin' for a sign.
"
18,2,Cartman,"I don't even know what that means.
"
18,2,Aunt Jemima,"When you're stuck, look to the pyramids.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Are you going to eat those pancakes?
"
18,2,Aunt Jemima,"They've got it wrong, child!  The world is upside down.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Oooo, trippy...
"
18,2,Aunt Jemima,"Tell then they've got's it backwards!
"
18,2,Cartman,"They've got what backward? 
"
18,2,Cartman,"Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.
"
18,2,Randy,"You can't just keep us in here!
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"We're out.  We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.
"
18,2,Blond,"They're just gonna let us starve to death?
"
18,2,Randy,"They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. 
"
18,2,Blond,"Well then, I guess I might as well eat! 
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"There's nothing left, I told you.
"
18,2,Blond,"There's plenty of pizza dough.
"
18,2,Randy,"Are you crazy?
"
18,2,Blond,"I'm crazy hungry!  Oh... Oh... Fuck it's so good.  I want more! ...it's been so long! 
"
18,2,Randy,"Oh my God, you...  but... you're okay.
"
18,2,Blond,"You don't think it's a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic? This whole thing was a setup, man!
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"A setup? But by who?
"
18,2,Randy,"Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.
"
18,2,Blond,"Maybe Papa John can help us. If we can get a hold of them, then maybe we can- 
"
18,2,Randy,"Ng-oh. 
"
18,2,Stan,"There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
"
18,2,DJ,"Well all right, time for action indeed. Let's go to the phone lines. Go ahead, caller.
"
18,2,Craig,"I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.
"
18,2,Kyle,"We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
"
18,2,Craig,"Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?
"
18,2,DJ,"All right, let's go to Jamie in Como. Go ahead.
"
18,2,Jamie,"It's like ya... ya say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away! It's kind of like.... telling everyone to go fuck themselves!
"
18,2,DJ,"Oh Kansas, watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air.
"
18,2,Wendy,"Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?
"
18,2,Stan,"I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
"
18,2,Wendy,"So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.
"
18,2,Scott,"That is correct, yes, I do.
"
18,2,Wendy,"You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?
"
18,2,Kyle,"Jesus Christ, dude.
"
18,2,Stan,"Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
"
18,2,Wendy,"Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!
"
18,2,Stan,"We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
"
18,2,Wendy,"Thought so. 
"
18,2,DJ,"Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric?
"
18,2,Cartman,"KYYYLE!
"
18,2,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
18,2,Cartman,"KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"It's dinner time on the East coast in less than an hour. People are going to die!
"
18,2,Jeff White,"Sir! They've got a boy on the hot line who says he might know something.
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"Who is this?
"
18,2,Cartman,"My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"The pyramid? That's ancient stuff you're talking about. Are you sure?  Bring up the pyramid! 
"
18,2,Cartman,"What, what is it? What is it for?
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"We built the pyramid a long time ago to illustrate how much people should eat of the four basic food groups.
"
18,2,Programmer,"Sir, we abandoned the pyramid when Michelle Obama got involved.
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"The pyramid down't work. We already tried it.
"
18,2,Cartman,"It's upside down.
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"What?
"
18,2,Cartman,"Sir, the pyramid is upside down.
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"Turn the pyramid upside down.
"
18,2,Programmer 2,"You can't be serious. That would put butter and fat at the top of the-
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"Flip the damned food pyramid!
"
18,2,Michael Taylor,"This is NOT FDA-approved!
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"It's dinnertime on the east coast in ten minutes! Now DO IT! 
"
18,2,Programmer 3,"Sir, we've got a match.
"
18,2,Programmer 4,"Nutrition is stabilizing!
"
18,2,Programmer 5,"We've got a well-balanced vaccine, sir! 
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"Get the President on the phone. Tell him... to have some steak with his butter.
"
18,2,Craig,"Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.
"
18,2,Kyle,"Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
"
18,2,Scott,"Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?
"
18,2,Kyle,"We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. 
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"We really dodged a bullet, young man. Thanks to you, America knows what to eat again.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
"
18,2,Tom Vilsack,"We're gonna get a better view of the stage.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. 
"
18,2,Jeff White,"Wait till my girls see that I was at a party with Lorde!
"
18,2,Clyde,"I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.
"
18,2,Jimmy,"Yeah, she isn't as hot in person.
"
18,2,Randy,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
"
18,2,Stan,"Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?
"
18,2,Wendy,"Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.
"
18,2,Stan,"Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
"
18,2,Wendy,"You're so transparent, Stan.
"
18,2,Stan,"What does that mean?
"
18,2,Wendy,"You wanna dance? 
"
18,2,Randy,"We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! 
"
18,3,Kyle,"Are you okay, Cartman?
"
18,3,Cartman,"Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
"
18,3,Butters,"Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Good for you. 
"
18,3,Butters,"I think someone's in there.
"
18,3,Cartman,"No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!
"
18,3,Craig,"Occupied.
"
18,3,Cartman,"I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
"
18,3,Craig,"You can't call dibs on a toilet.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!
"
18,3,Kyle,"Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this! 
"
18,3,Wendy,"What the hell do you think you're doing?
"
18,3,Cartman,"I'm going to the potty.
"
18,3,Wendy,"This is the girls bathroom!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
"
18,3,Wendy,"WHAT?!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Did you notice the bow?  I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!
"
18,3,Wendy,"GET OUT OF HERE!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. 
"
18,3,Red,"What the hell is that?!
"
18,3,Wendy,"Cartman is using our bathroom!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.
"
18,3,Red,"Hey! I'm gonna tell on you!
"
18,3,Cartman,"It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. 
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!
"
18,3,Cartman,"That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"Alright, listen Eric!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Erica.
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!
"
18,3,Cartman,"All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"With the what?!
"
18,3,Mr. Garrison,"Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.
"
18,3,Mr. Mackey,"But then cisgender-ed is just normal
"
18,3,Mr. Garrison,"Saying ""normal"" is extremely offensive to people who aren't in that group.  Trust me, you don't want this hot potato! Just let him use the girls room!
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"But this isn't a hurting confused child we're talking about. It's Eric Cartman.
"
18,3,Mr. Garrison,"Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants.
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?
"
18,3,Mr. Garrison,"Actually,  it's more like a royal flush.
"
18,3,Reporter,"Gerald Broflovski?
"
18,3,Gerald,"Yes?
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I was hoping you could help me... make sense of somethin'. I understand you had a very large party in your back yard last... last Sunday, was it?
"
18,3,Gerald,"That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"I also understand that a very famous pop artist, Lorde, was the entertainment at that party.
"
18,3,Gerald,"Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"Well it, eh, it's just a little curious, you know? Why a hugely popular Top-20 artist would play such a... well no offence, but such a humble venue?
"
18,3,Gerald,"...Sorry, I don't think I get your-
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"You understand, we deal with a lot of fake stories at Spin.  Was just wondering how the boys got someone like Lorde to play.
"
18,3,Gerald,"From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"You wouldn't know who?
"
18,3,Gerald,"No. Does it really matter?
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"Lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady. It would be a shame if someone was... having fun at her expense.
"
18,3,Sharon,"Randy? Whose are these?
"
18,3,Randy,"Aaah I don't know. Why?
"
18,3,Sharon,"Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?
"
18,3,Randy,"In my jeans?
"
18,3,Sharon,"Randy? Do you have something to tell me?
"
18,3,Randy,"...Yeah. I do.
"
18,3,Red,"Come on! You've been in there for twenty minutes!
"
18,3,Sia,"Yeah! Recess is almost over!
"
18,3,Cartman,"There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
"
18,3,Sia,"Not while you're in here!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
"
18,3,Wendy,"Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-
"
18,3,Cartman,"Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what?  That's what.  Suck my clit and balls.
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.
"
18,3,Cartman,"I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. 
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you! 
"
18,3,Cartman,"Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"Would that be agreeable to you?
"
18,3,Cartman,"OH MY GOD!
"
18,3,Wendy,"That isn't fair!
"
18,3,Red,"Wendy, just go with it!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.
"
18,3,Designer,"Uh huh, well why don't you put the water feature on this side?
"
18,3,Cartman,"Oh on that side?
"
18,3,Designer,"You know, because you've already got AC over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
"
18,3,Randy,"Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.
"
18,3,Record Executive,"I know your wife means a lot to you, Randy,  but you can't leave us hanging. You've got the purest shit out there; it's worth a lot to us.
"
18,3,Randy,"You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
"
18,3,Record Executive,"How many times have you said ""I think I've lost it"" and everything turned out to be okay?
"
18,3,Randy,"Every time?
"
18,3,Record Executive,"Every time. Come on. Get back to work and see. If you get panicked again, call me.
"
18,3,Randy,"Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup. 
"
18,3,Ron,"You wanted to see me?
"
18,3,Record Executive,"Sit down, Ron.  Whattaya know about one of our artists, Lorde?
"
18,3,Ron,"Seventeen-year-old girl from New Zealand, great songwriter,  humble.
"
18,3,Record Executive,"Wrong.  She's a 45-year-old man in Colorado.
"
18,3,Ron,"What?
"
18,3,Record Executive,"He writes the songs, sends us the demos, we fudge them, sell them as a brooding 17-year-old girl way ahead of her time, and nobody knows the difference.
"
18,3,Ron,"Huh.  Holy shit.
"
18,3,Record Executive,"He makes good stuff. Stuff that sells. But he's getting edgy feet. I want you to keep an eye on him. And if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth, well... you know what to do.
"
18,3,Randy,"Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.
"
18,3,Sharon,"Randy?
"
18,3,Randy,"I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. 
"
18,3,Sharon,"I was. Can you help me unload the car? 
"
18,3,Randy,"Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.
"
18,3,Sharon,"Randy?
"
18,3,Randy,"Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Coming. 
"
18,3,Stan,"What is that?
"
18,3,Butters,"That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.
"
18,3,Stan,"Cartman's a girl now?
"
18,3,Butters,"He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 
"
18,3,Cartman,"It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go.  Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome.  Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good!  Perfect.  Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide.  You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready!  Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"Peter Nelson?
"
18,3,Nelson,"Yes?
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I understand you work at the U.S. Geological Survey?
"
18,3,Nelson,"Yeah, that's right.
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"I also understand that you're the uncle of the amazing and talented songwriter, Lorde?
"
18,3,Nelson,"Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay?
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"Work with her? How? 
"
18,3,Nelson,"I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"How's that?
"
18,3,Nelson,"Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology.
"
18,3,Brandon Carlile,"The what?
"
18,3,Nelson,"She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch. 
"
18,3,Clyde,"Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Yup! You know what Hillary says: ""You can suck my clit and balls."" 
"
18,3,Red,"Well I know I'm not even gonna get it done. I swear, he gives us too much homework anyway. I-
"
18,3,Wendy,"Hey guys. 
"
18,3,Red,"...Wendy?
"
18,3,Wendy,"How's it hanging'?
"
18,3,Craig,"Whoa..
"
18,3,Jenny,"Huh?
"
18,3,Jason,"Whoa, wait, is that?
"
18,3,Butters,"Holy moly! 
"
18,3,Cartman,"Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
"
18,3,Wendy,"It's cool. I'll wait.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Dude, this is my fuckin' bathroom!
"
18,3,Cartman,"I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-
"
18,3,Cartman,"Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?
"
18,3,Cartman,"Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"I thought you were a chick.
"
18,3,Cartman,"No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!
"
18,3,Stan,"What?
"
18,3,Cartman,"Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! 
"
18,3,Randy,"Shelly, that's enough time on your phone.
"
18,3,Shelly,"Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!
"
18,3,Randy,"You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
"
18,3,Shelly,"Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!
"
18,3,Randy,"Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. 
"
18,3,Stan,"Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
"
18,3,Randy,"Oh really? About... about what?
"
18,3,Stan,"Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
"
18,3,Randy,"Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde.
"
18,3,Stan,"...What?
"
18,3,Randy,"It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.
"
18,3,Stan,"Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
"
18,3,Randy,"Yah, that's my cover.
"
18,3,Stan,"The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
"
18,3,Randy,"Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go ""Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games."" But they just- do what they want with my songs.
"
18,3,Stan,"Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.
"
18,3,Randy,"Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  ""Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn""  ""Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter.""
"
18,3,Stan,"Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.
"
18,3,Randy,"Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  ""Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter.""  Stan?
"
18,3,Butters,"Hey! Everything okay, Stan?
"
18,3,Stan,"...I don't know where I belong...
"
18,3,Butters,"Just hold it. That's what I do now. 
"
18,3,Cartman,"Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom?
"
18,3,Stan,"I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
"
18,3,Cartman,"He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
"
18,3,Randy,"You wanted to see me, boss?
"
18,3,Boss,"Yes. Please have a seat, Lorde.
"
18,3,Randy,"Hi Carol.
"
18,3,Carol,"Lorde.
"
18,3,Boss,"Lorde, we're all big fans of your music and we think the world of you for staying and working here even after your music career took off.
"
18,3,Randy,"Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.
"
18,3,Boss,"Amazing, yeah. Uh... Lorde... for some time now the females at this office have been pressuring me to... uh... find your own space... to go to the bathroom.  Everyone loves you, but we thought it would be great if you had your very own executive bathroom. 
"
18,3,Randy,"I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.
"
18,3,Carol,"My girls are big fans of your music, Lorde, but the women here aren't comfortable sharing a bathroom with 
"
18,3,Randy,"With what?  With what? 
"
18,3,Announcer,"You are watching E! Entertainment News! That's how low you've sunk.
"
18,3,Anchor,"It's been several days and still there's no sign of the pop singer Lorde. The singer went dark on Twitter claiming severe depression, and stating  ""I realize now that I make people uncomfortable. I need to give this up and go back to just being the old me."" Spin Magazine is claiming they know the reason for the sudden exit, and will be releasing a tell-all article about the troubled artist next week.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
"
18,3,Butters,"Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
"
18,3,Cartman,"At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!
"
18,3,Butters,"Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!
"
18,3,Clyde,"Awe, come on, lay off him guys.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
"
18,3,Clyde,"No, no, just he is. 
"
18,3,Sharon,"You just gonna drink beer alone all day?
"
18,3,Randy,"It's okay, it's gluten free.
"
18,3,Sharon,"All right.  Do you know why young people like Lorde so much.  It's because she's something different. Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I'd tell her? I'd tell her not to let people change who she is. I'd tell her that if people are making fun of her, it's probably because they lost touch with being human. I'd tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That's... what I would say to Lorde. 
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. 
"
18,3,Cartman,"I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. 
"
18,3,Principal Victoria,"Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.
"
18,3,Butters,"Hey! Where do you think you're going?!
"
18,3,Stan,"To the bathroom?
"
18,3,Butters,"Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 
"
18,3,Stan,"Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah
"
18,4,Stephen,"Well that was a lot of fun. Thanks for inviting us, guys.
"
18,4,Sheila,"Sure. You bet.
"
18,4,Gerald,"Are you guys parked over here?
"
18,4,Stephen,"Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way.
"
18,4,Gerald,"A Handicar? What's that?
"
18,4,Linda,"You don't use Handicar?
"
18,4,Stephen,"No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up.
"
18,4,Gerald,"Wow...
"
18,4,Stephen,"Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes.  Honey, our Handicar is here.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
18,4,Stephen,"Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad. 
"
18,4,Gerald,"Lucky.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy. 
"
18,4,Stephen,"Download the app! It works great! 
"
18,4,Passenger,"Ahh,  Excuse me, I think someone puked back here. 
"
18,4,Russian,"You don't like puke?
"
18,4,Passenger,"Could you turn the radio down and the air conditioning up, please?
"
18,4,Russian,"No air conditioning. Too expensive. 
"
18,4,Passenger,"Agh!
"
18,4,Russian,"Not enough people taking cab. Don't know what's wrong!
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
18,4,Russian,"What the fuck?
"
18,4,Mr. Stevenson,"We've got a big sales event going on, folks.  Hey guys. Can I get you in a 2014 Hummer? Rocktober sales event, guys.
"
18,4,Younger Man,"No thanks.
"
18,4,Mr. Stevenson,"Only a few more guitar licks left in Rocktober, guys.
"
18,4,Older Man,"We're good. Shut up! 
"
18,4,Younger Man,"Oh, here's our Handicar.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy. 
"
18,4,Mr. Stevenson,"The fuck?
"
18,4,Steve,"All right, kids, you know what time of year this is?  That's right, it's autumn! And that means our fundraising for next year's summer camp is in full gear. Is everyone psyched for next year's summer camp?
"
18,4,All,"Yeeaahhh!
"
18,4,Steve,"So far, Jimmy has raised $16!
"
18,4,All,"Yeeaahhh!
"
18,4,Steve,"Francis has raised $29.32  And Timmy has raised $2,063.00!
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
18,4,Steve,"All righty, if you guys keep this up, we'll raise the money for summer camp in no time! 
"
18,4,Nathan,"I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp.
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'awww, we don't like camp, boss?
"
18,4,Nathan,"We hate camp, Mimsy. The singing, the competitions, Jimmy Valmer getting all the chicks.
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'oh yeah and don't forget last year at summer camp, you got raped by a shark. 
"
18,4,Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsyyyy! I'm not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes. We gotta find a way to put Handicar out of business, and fast.
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'ah oh boy! We're gonna wreck Timmy's business, huh boss?
"
18,4,Nathan,"Shh-shh. 
"
18,4,Steve,"Hey boys, are you excited for camp next year?
"
18,4,Nathan,"Yes, Counselor Steve. We like the tug-of-waaarr.
"
18,4,Steve,"All right. Well, just keep working on those donations. 
"
18,4,Nathan,"Come on, Mimsy, we gotta figure out how we're gonna make Handicar a thing of the past.
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'oh boy!
"
18,4,SP Cabbie,"We are united as brothers, because jast as Handicar has taken away jobs from honest, hard-working cab drivers, it's also taken food  from the mouths of the children of car salesmen!
"
18,4,Mr. Stevenson,"Well I don't have any children.
"
18,4,Russian,"Who does this handicapped boy think he is?! He's not even in union!
"
18,4,Arab,"He's taking all our business because people find it more coomvenient.
"
18,4,SP Cabbie,"Aaand, because he's handicapped, he can use special access points and parking spaces. That kid was born with an unfair advantage!
"
18,4,Arab,"Who is this rat?!
"
18,4,Nathan,"His name is Timmy Burch.  And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good.
"
18,4,American,"Who are you?!
"
18,4,Nathan,"Just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs. That's all.
"
18,4,Russian,"Nobody takes jobs away from US! We need to speak to Mayor and tell her to shut down this illegitimate business!
"
18,4,Arab,"Or maybe we can have the police shut him down!
"
18,4,Mimsy,"Hey I got an idea! Why don't you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer, and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with Handicar's popularity in the marketplace?
"
18,4,Nathan,"Just ignore my friend. He's mentally disabled.
"
18,4,Mimsy,"Aw yeah, don't mind me.
"
18,4,Nathan,"Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake?
"
18,4,Mr. Stevenson,"Offer it last year's Christmas in Rocksummer prizes?
"
18,4,Nathan,"No, you fucking moron! You kill... the snake! 
"
18,4,SP Cabbie,"Hey wake up, you little scab!
"
18,4,Timmy,"Tutih Tuh-Timmih?
"
18,4,SP Cabbie,"We got a message for ya! From the union. 
"
18,4,Nathan,"Just imagine it, Mimsy. A whole summer to ourselves to do what we want. It's going to be awesome.  Well well, hello gentlemen. I understand you've taken care of our little problem?
"
18,4,SP Cabbie,"Yeah, we sure did!
"
18,4,Russian,"Let's just say he'll be laid up a while.
"
18,4,SP Cabbie,"Yeah. We snuck in his room last night and we... broke his legs!
"
18,4,Nathan,"Oh boy, that's great-wait, you what??
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
18,4,Randy,"I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde.
"
18,4,Russian,"But we broke his legs. Both of them.
"
18,4,Nathan,"Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS!
"
18,4,Nathan,"How can people be so ineffectual, Mimsy?
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'uh I don't know, boss.
"
18,4,Nathan,"These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs. Maybe Handicar is a kind of economic natural selection, where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones. Drrrrr.
"
18,4,Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsyyyy!
"
18,4,Woman 1,"Right here is good.  Thank you. I can just use the app to tip you, right?
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy!
"
18,4,Woman 1,"Ohohh, this is so handy!  Thank you!
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy.  Tiiimmih Timmih.
"
18,4,Nathan,"Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
18,4,Nathan,"Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
18,4,Nathan,"I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Hmmm, Timmih.
"
18,4,Nathan,"I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
18,4,Nathan,"That's great. Summer camp, here we come.  Now kiss your business goodbye, asshole!
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'ah I don't get it boss. I thought you hated Handicar. How come now you wanna work for 'em?
"
18,4,Nathan,"It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers.
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'ahhh, sexual harassment, boss?
"
18,4,Nathan,"It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me.
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'ah oh boy!
"
18,4,Nathan,"Timmy. Hello ma'am. Handicar at your service. Climb on in.  So, let me ask you a question. Would you like to see my dick?
"
18,4,Woman 2,"Sure. Would you like to see mine?
"
18,4,Nathan,"Uh oh!
"
18,4,Nathan,"Mimsy! Hel- help, Mimsy!  And I thought a shark was bad. 
"
18,4,Gerald,"Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.
"
18,4,Stephen,"Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila.
"
18,4,Gerald,"Stephen, what are you doing?
"
18,4,Stephen,"You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in.  I'm telling you Gerald, havin' a Handicar is a grat way to make some money on the side. 
"
18,4,HC Driver 1,"Timmy!
"
18,4,Stephen,"Timmy!
"
18,4,HC Driver 2,"Timmy!
"
18,4,Stephen,"The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald.
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'aww gee, your idea to have Handicar expand really worked, boss.
"
18,4,HC Driver 3,"'Scuse me, out of my way, please. I have a Handicap. 
"
18,4,Nathan,"I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one!
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'ahhh, you sound like that Matthew McConaughey guy. ""Ah I drove a Lincoln before I got paid to drive one. Drrrr."" 
"
18,4,Nathan,"Shut up Mimsyyy!
"
18,4,Announcer,"For the pat eight years Tesla has been the leading innovator in the world of automotive transport. And now the President and CEO of Tesla Motorcars, Elon Musk. 
"
18,4,Elon Musk,"Today I am proud to annouce the Tesla D, the most innovative and efficient world-friendly mode of transportation ever created. Any questions?
"
18,4,Reporter 1,"Yes, ahh, what about Handicar?
"
18,4,Elon Musk,"What about it?!
"
18,4,Reporter 2,"Well all over the country prople are realzing that using an app to ride-share is even more convenient and eco-friendly than electric cars.
"
18,4,Reporter 3,"How do you intend to compete with this boy genius in Colorado? 
"
18,4,Elon Musk,"I am so sick of hearing about app-based ride-sharing! The future of transportation is the electric cars, not wheelchairs!
"
18,4,Exec. 1,"Don't worry, Elon. Handicar is just a small company.
"
18,4,Exec. 2,"Oh sure, operating in a few small towns, but when they start absorbing the taxi markets, bringing taxi sservice to any part of the world, driving your kids to and from school, delivering both people and things?
"
18,4,Exec. 3,"We can't compete with Handicar! It's just so damned handy!
"
18,4,Elon Musk,"If there is a way to reduce Handicar's positive publicity, then we need to do it now!  And you! You say it's theoretically possible?
"
18,4,Nathan,"Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake?
"
18,4,Elon Musk,"Who's the sheepherder?
"
18,4,Nathan,"You are.
"
18,4,Exec. 4,"Who's the snake?
"
18,4,Nathan,"Handicar. 
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'ah, it's an analogy.
"
18,4,Nathan,"Shut up Mimsyyy!  If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing your sheep, all you have to do is prove to the sheep that the snake is a completely inferior entity. 
"
18,4,HC Driver 4,"Timmy!
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
18,4,Nathan,"Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
18,4,Nathan,"That's great. I can't wait for camp this year.  We are doing some fundraising too. Have you heard of my friend Elon Musk from Tesla?
"
18,4,Elon Musk,"Good day to you!
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
18,4,Nathan,"Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours.
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'ah we're gonna get Timmy killed in the race, huh boss?
"
18,4,Elon Musk,"Shut up, Mimsy! 
"
18,4,Nathan,"Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp. 
"
18,4,Jimbo,"Hey everyone, you need to see this! 
"
18,4,CNN Anchor,"What started as a simple contest is quickly escalating into an international crisis. As electronic cars challenge the oil industry, and transportation alternatives fight for dominance, the unavoidable outcome may be a conflict the likes the world has not seen since the '70s. It appears that the world is once again on the brink  of Wacky Races.
"
18,4,Randy,"Wacky Races?! Holy shit!
"
18,4,CNN Anchor,"The prime minister of Japan (Shinzo Abe is shown) insisted that any race would break the Treaty of Salzburg, which called for a cease-fire to the Wacky Races for their senseless brutality. They also claim that if a race does take place, they would have no choice but to enter their completely self-driven prototype Lexus into the conflict. The Canadians and Chinese are also saying they would be forced to race, and no one yet has heard from Dick Dastardly or Muttley. Unless a miracle happens, this Saturday morning the world will witness the fist Wacky Races in nearly 50 years.
"
18,4,Shoppers,"Wacky Races oh God! Wacky Races oh my God! Oh my God Wacky Races oh my God!
"
18,4,Gerald,"Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!
"
18,4,Randy,"I know! Are we watching at your house?!
"
18,4,Manager,"That's it, everyone! We're out of cereal!
"
18,4,Shoppers,"No! I didn't get any! That guy has two! 
"
18,4,Manager,"There's none left, don't you understand?!
"
18,4,Stephen,"Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!
"
18,4,HC Driver 5,"Don't do the race. You don't have to prove anything. 
"
18,4,HC Driver 6,"He HAS to do it, don't you see? He has people that are depending on him to raise as much money as possible. There are hundreds of people with handicaps now.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih...
"
18,4,HC Driver 7,"But isn't that the problem? I mean, let's face it, it's not like he's able to keep the driver quality up. Anyone can have a Handicap now. I mean, even Matthew McConaughey is a Handicar driver now, for Chrit's sake!
"
18,4,Matthew McConaughey,"Hey.  I was drivin' a Handicar... way before I got paid to drive one. I just like how it feels.
"
18,4,Stephen,"Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry.  Hold on, sorry, went too far.  This is your opportunity to make Handicar thee transportation of thte future. Think what you could do with all that money. 
"
18,4,Announcer,"And here they are, the most daredevil group of shared-ride drivers ever to whirl their wheels in the Wacky Races, competing for the title of the future of transportation. Cars are apporoaching the starting line. First off is the Lyft car , a ride-sharing company out of San Francisco. next up is the ZipCar, a pay-by-the-hour concept based on Chinese bicycles. Maneuvering for position is the standard taxicab driven by an angry Russian. Right behind is the Hummer salesman in his 2014 Hummer No Class. And there's ingenious inventor Elon Musk in his new Tesla D. Oh, and here's the lovely Canadian actress Neve Campbell in the Canadian conept vehicle The Queef, powered completely on female natural gas.  Next we have the Handicar with Timmy Burch. And there's the completely automated self-driving car from Japan. Limping along last are those double-dealing do-badders Dick Dasterdly and his sidekick Muttley.  And away they go on the way out Wacky Races.  And this live coverage of the event will be braodcast all morning, of course, on CNN.
"
18,4,Stuart,"Jesus. It's begun.
"
18,4,Gerald,"God help them all.
"
18,4,Randy,"All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.
"
18,4,BBC Announcer,"You are watching BBC World.
"
18,4,BBC Anchor,"The vioent conflict over transport is underway, and it is even more senseless and vile than many remember. We return you now to our live coverage of.. the Wacky Races.
"
18,4,Annoucer,"As the Wacky Raccers roll down the roadway, we see that the taxicab in in the lead, with Handicar pulling up the rear.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
18,4,Announcer,"All the cars must follow the same route. First they'll leave the town of South Park, then navigate through Giggling Gulch on the final stretch to pick up the passenger, a Miss Dotty Applegate. Once the passenger is picked up, the vehicle must successfully deliver her to the destination point at her daughter's house in Morrison.  It looks like the ZipCar is trying to vie for position past the Hummer vehicle. It's neck and neck as the Wacky Racers all push to be first to pick up the passenger.  Miss Applegate is waiting patiently.  And Elon Musk's Tesla appears to take the lead.
"
18,4,Nathan,"Slow down. I need Timmy to pick up the passenger before we do.
"
18,4,Elon Musk,"But I though we wanted Handicar to lose the race!
"
18,4,Nathan,"He can't just lose the race, he has to get sued and lose the whole business. That's why when he picks up the passemger, I've got a little surprise waiting for him. 
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'ah hey boss, it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya. If you really don't wanna go to summer camp so bad, why don't you just tell your parents how you feel?  You know, tell 'em you don't wanna go and just see how they react.  Wait wait, I got it.  Shut up, Mimsy!
"
18,4,Nathan,"Hey Mimsy.
"
18,4,Mimsy,"Yeah?
"
18,4,Nathan,"Shut up! 
"
18,4,Announcer,"The Canadian car overtakes the self-driving car. And now here comes the ZipCar, which is being driven by Matthew McConaughey.
"
18,4,Matthew McConaughey,"I was drivin' a ZipCar... way before I got paid to drive one.
"
18,4,Announcer,"And look at this! The Lyft car is the first to arrive and pick up the passenger.  Now the Lyft car must take the passenger to her destination, but look at this! The Hummer salesman is running the Lyft car off the road! And the Hummer salesman is taking the passenger to the car and he is gong to let her drive herself!
"
18,4,Mr. Stevenson,"You've got a fully automated sound system and your sunroof is operated right here. What do you think? Huh? Can you see yourself in one of these puppies?
"
18,4,Announcer,"Elon Musk is using one of his kooky inventions to put the Hummer out of commission for good. 
"
18,4,Gerald,"Wow.
"
18,4,Randy,"Geez!
"
18,4,Stuart,"God.
"
18,4,Randy,"Did you see that?! Oh!
"
18,4,Announcer,"The passenger is being taken to the Tesla D now.  No way! She just got snatched by the pissed off Russian in his taxi. Miss Applegate is now in the back of the taxi and she's being forced to watch Jimmy Fallon.  Uh oh, the Canadian car has completely run out of queefs.  With the race neearly over, it's taxi out in front followed by self-driving car, and then pulling up in third is Handicar!
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
18,4,Announcer,"It's gonna be a close one!
"
18,4,Dick Dastardly,"Not too close, Boopsie! 
"
18,4,Announcer,"Oh no, Dick Dastardly is up to no-do-goodery again.
"
18,4,Randy,"Ohh! Ohh! Duuude! 
"
18,4,Gerald,"Oh no! Ohh!
"
18,4,Sharon,"Oh no, I can't watch! 
"
18,4,Randy,"Oooo! Booom!
"
18,4,Mrs. McCormick,"Ohohohh!
"
18,4,Stuart,"Nice! Oh yeah! 
"
18,4,Announcer,"And there's Handicar to pick Miss Applegate up. 
"
18,4,Nathan,"That's it! Handicar has the passenger! We're almost in range! Another hundred feet!  Wait a minute. What the hell are all those cars?  Holy shit! 
"
18,4,HC drivers,"Timmy! Timmy! 
"
18,4,Elon Musk,"Aaaaaah!
"
18,4,HC drivers,"Timmy!
"
18,4,Announcer,"We're near the finish line; the race is almost over. Handicar is in the lead, still way out in front of the ZipCar driven by Matthew McConaughey. 
"
18,4,Matthew McConaughey,"Sometimes you gotta go forward by goin' backward. Are we drivin' cars or are cars... drivin' us?
"
18,4,Announcer,"Dastardly car is racing past both.  This could be an upset, folks. 
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
18,4,Nathan,"Goodnight, you son of a bitch!  Mimsy! I told you to put the explosives under Timmy's seat!
"
18,4,Mimsy,"D'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!
"
18,4,Nathan,"Not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves! 
"
18,4,Announcer,"Oh my, it appears that an explosion has opend up a wormhole with Matthew McConaughey inside.
"
18,4,Matthew McConaughey,"Mimsy! 
"
18,4,Announcer,"And there's the finish. It looks like Handicar has done it!
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
18,4,Steve,"A big congratulations to our fundraising champion! After selling the Handicar rights to Elon Musk, Timmy has raised 2.3 billion dollars for summer camp.  Great job to all of you. This is sure to be the best summer camp ever! 
"
18,4,Nathan's Mom,"All set for bed, honey?
"
18,4,Nathan,"Yeah I like to sleep at nighttime.
"
18,4,Nathan's Mom,"All right, goodnight. 
"
18,4,Nathan,"Wait!  Wait, Mom? Can we talk?
"
18,4,Nathan's Mom,"Um... yes, o-of course. 
"
18,4,Nathan,"This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore.
"
18,4,Nathan's Mom,"I'm sorry, I can't understand you honey. You're handicapped.
"
18,4,Nathan,"What's to understand? I'm telling you I don't want to that stupid camp anymore!
"
18,4,Nathan's Mom,"You want water? Is that what you want?
"
18,4,Nathan,"No! I don't wanna go to camp!
"
18,4,Nathan's Mom,"Ohhh yes, okay honey, I'll turn off the lamp. 
"
18,4,Nathan,"No! That's not what I fucking said!  Goddamnit, now I can't even see! Ow!
"
18,4,Nathan's Dad,"What's he saying?
"
18,4,Nathan's Mom,"That he doesn't wanna go to summer camp this year, but I'll be damned if he's gonna ruin our Italy trip.
"
18,4,Nathan's Dad,"Right.
"
18,4,Nathan,"Oh! Aah! Mimsy!
"
18,5,Butters,"Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?
"
18,5,Butters,"Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl!  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!
"
18,5,Butters,"I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
"
18,5,Cartman,"No it isn't.
"
18,5,Butters,"My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
"
18,5,Cartman,"That's stupid.
"
18,5,Butters,"You can see the momma bird fly in.
"
18,5,Cartman,"I'm dying of boredom.
"
18,5,Butters,"We took all kinds of video with his drone.
"
18,5,Cartman,"What did you say?
"
18,5,Butters,"You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Your dad has a fucking drone?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Whooaa! 
"
18,5,Butters,"It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
"
18,5,Cartman,"You wanna take it out for a spin?
"
18,5,Butters,"Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!
"
18,5,Butters,"My dad said it's not for spying on people.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
"
18,5,Butters,"Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
"
18,5,Butters,"No, Eric. I don't wanna d-
"
18,5,Stephen,"Butters?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go!  I'll see you later at my house.
"
18,5,Stephen,"Butters, are you home??
"
18,5,Butters,"Comin' dad! 
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters, is that you?
"
18,5,Butters,"Yes, it's me.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!
"
18,5,Butters,"Of course not!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Alright, come in.  Kenny's here; I told him all about it. 
"
18,5,Butters,"What?! You said nobody would know!
"
18,5,Cartman,"It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! 
"
18,5,Butters,"Be careful! The powerlines!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!  Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Okay, try to get closer!)
"
18,5,Butters,"Okay, uh maybe that's enough. 
"
18,5,Cartman,"Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.  Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Are you serious?!)
"
18,5,Butters,"Let me see!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Stop taping!)
"
18,5,Butters,"Jeeeeezz!
"
18,5,Cartman,"This thing is recording, right?
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
18,5,Cartman,"Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! 
"
18,5,Butters,"What do I do?!
"
18,5,Cartman,"His dad sees you!
"
18,5,Butters,"I don't know what to do!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Fly back to the house, stupid!
"
18,5,Thomas,"You've got a problem, Stotch!
"
18,5,Stephen,"What are you talkin' about?
"
18,5,Thomas,"You know what I'm talkin' about! There was a drone spyin' on my wife, and you're the only person I know with a drone!
"
18,5,Stephen,"Hey now hold on. I am a drone hobby enthusiast. I would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct.
"
18,5,Thomas,"Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now!
"
18,5,Stephen,"I assure you, my drone is sitting in the garage. I'll show you.
"
18,5,Stephen,"There, you see? It's right there. 
"
18,5,Thomas,"So, thuh so you flew it back here in time.
"
18,5,Stephen,"I swear I didn't fly it.
"
18,5,Thomas,"Well these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone! 
"
18,5,Stephen,"Butters?
"
18,5,Butters,"Oh, heh-hey dad.
"
18,5,Stephen,"Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage?
"
18,5,Butters,"Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
"
18,5,Stephen,"Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you.
"
18,5,Butters,"I love you too, Dad. 
"
18,5,Cartman,"Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Yeah, I know, dude.)
"
18,5,Cartman,"Not a word, Kenny!
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Alright!) 
"
18,5,Stan,"Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
"
18,5,Kyle,"Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
"
18,5,Stan,"I know. 
"
18,5,Cartman,"Hey you guys.
"
18,5,Stan,"Sup? 
"
18,5,Cartman,"You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Dude! What the fuck!)
"
18,5,Stan,"What?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? 
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Dude!)
"
18,5,Kyle,"That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
"
18,5,Cartman,"You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
"
18,5,Kyle,"Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
"
18,5,Stan,"Let me see.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.
"
18,5,Stan,"How'd you get that on your phone?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Uh huh.)
"
18,5,Kyle,"That's terrible!
"
18,5,Cartman,"I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
"
18,5,Jimmy,"Hey, Craig. Have you checked out the Internet lately? 
"
18,5,Craig,"What are you talking about? 
"
18,5,Jimmy,"Ohhhh nothin'. It's just that... y-you might wanna invest in some hedge clippers. 
"
18,5,Craig,"For what?
"
18,5,Jimmy,"Ohhhh nothin'. You just might wanna... hire Tarzan to do some... landscaping work for your mom. 
"
18,5,Butters,"What the heck are you doing?!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.
"
18,5,Butters,"When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters-
"
18,5,Butters,"You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters. Butters.
"
18,5,Butters,"Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!
"
18,5,Butters,"WHY?!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
"
18,5,Butters,"I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! 
"
18,5,Roger,"Hi everyone. For those of you I don't know as well, my name is Roger Donovan, and un, just like you I'm pretty upset about what's going on in our neighborhood.
"
18,5,Thomas,"How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that!
"
18,5,Roger,"Yes, well luckily nobody's watched the video of course.  But the fact is that these drones are only getting more popular. I mean, anyone can get a drone off Amazon for 200 bucks, and there's no laws and the whole thing is pretty damned hairy. Oh-ohh, God I'm sorry Laura.  You know I I meant the situation is pretty hairy, right? Nothin' to do with you p-personally. I mean, how would I even know? I didn't see it.  Um...
"
18,5,Randy,"Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.  Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. 
"
18,5,Laura Tucker,"You know, it used to be called ""natural"". Completely shaving bald down there used to be the weird thing.
"
18,5,Thomas,"It's okay honey, the-
"
18,5,Laura,"But now, because I ""choose"" not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be,
"
18,5,Randy,"Eeww.
"
18,5,Laura,"I'm labelled as some kind of freaking monster!
"
18,5,Roger,"And and and that's the point. I mean, we all have things about ourselves that are embarrassing, that that-
"
18,5,Laura,"I'm not embarrassed about it! It's natural!
"
18,5,Stuart,"It's a lot of natural.
"
18,5,Roger,"Look, look, why we're here is because it's gonna take all of us, a neighborhood watch, to make sure that our community stays safe.
"
18,5,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?
"
18,5,Randy,"It's simple.
"
18,5,Randy,"Oh yeah, this is gonna work great. 
"
18,5,Kyle,"Are you happy now?!
"
18,5,Cartman,"What? 
"
18,5,Kyle,"Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
"
18,5,Cartman,"What does that have to do with me?
"
18,5,Kyle,"See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
"
18,5,Kyle,"I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-
"
18,5,Cartman,"You were what?!
"
18,5,Kyle,"I was in the bathroom-
"
18,5,Cartman,"You were spying on me?!
"
18,5,Kyle,"No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
"
18,5,Cartman,"But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
"
18,5,Kyle,"How is that spying?!
"
18,5,Cartman,"You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! 
"
18,5,Clerk,"Hello, can I help you?
"
18,5,Stephen,"Yes, I'd like to return this drone. 
"
18,5,Clerk,"You wanna return it?
"
18,5,Stephen,"Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore.
"
18,5,Clerk,"The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it? 
"
18,5,Stephen,"Look, something's wrong with it. It does things, it...  flies by itself.
"
18,5,Clerk,"Uhh, noo, somebody has to control it.
"
18,5,Stephen,"You don't understand. It was in the garage and the battery was fully charged. Someone said they'd seen it flying around, so I checked.  The battery was half empty.
"
18,5,Clerk,"I'm sorry, but we don't do returns. 
"
18,5,Stephen,"Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about.
"
18,5,Clerk,"Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it. 
"
18,5,Stephen,"You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything.
"
18,5,Clerk,"Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?
"
18,5,Stephen,"No, it's impossible. He's not allowed to fly it without my supervision. 
"
18,5,Thomas,"Oh for God's sakes!  Goddamnit get the hell out of here!  That DOES IT!
"
18,5,Thomas,"You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal!
"
18,5,Officer 1,"But they aren't illegal, Mr. Tucker.
"
18,5,Thomas,"Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!
"
18,5,Sgt. Yates,"Nono, none of us watched the video, but if we did, we could handle it. We're police officers. We see sickening things like that every day.
"
18,5,Officer 1,"We understand the humiliation your wife has gone through, Mr. Tucker, but we don't-
"
18,5,Laura,"I haven't been ""humiliated"", I've been wronged! We are here to ask for your help, now are you gonna help us or not?!
"
18,5,Officer 1,"Well that'd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company.
"
18,5,Officer 2,"Or perhaps a forest ranger?
"
18,5,Thomas,"Help us with the drones spying on us!!
"
18,5,Sgt. Yates,"All right, all right. We'll do everything we can.
"
18,5,Butters,"Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters.
"
18,5,Butters,"Why would you turn ""Craig's mom's bush"" into a music video starring us?!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Because, Butters-
"
18,5,Butters,"Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.
"
18,5,Butters,"Why?!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. ""Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one.""
"
18,5,Butters,"That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!
"
18,5,Randy,"Heheh, Gerald is watching Housewives of Atlanta.
"
18,5,Sharon,"You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.
"
18,5,Randy,"I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  Oh shit!  Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!  I've been shot!  No! Noooo!
"
18,5,Anchor,"Shock and outrage all over the state tonight after an on-duty police drone chased and shot down an unarmed civilian drone, and worst of all, yes, the civilian drone was black. 
"
18,5,Jimbo,"What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!
"
18,5,Randy,"I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
"
18,5,Farmer,"It was about yay big.  I mean the hair on it was out to here , and then it had another trail of hair down from her belly button. I mean, the, the drone. Yeah, that's what I saw. That that's all I saw.
"
18,5,Anchor,"While police claim they were only following standard protocol, the drone owners are banding together and holding a candlelight vigil.
"
18,5,Police drone,"Please disperse. Candles on top of drones are a fire hazard,  Return to your garages.
"
18,5,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell are these police drones doing? We can't protest now?
"
18,5,Steve,"Just hover, honey. They can't do anything if we're just hovering.
"
18,5,Stephen,"Randy. We need to talk.
"
18,5,Randy,"Okay.
"
18,5,Stephen,"Inside.  I've been going over it and over it in my head. I thought Butters and I were alone, but then I saw you on the news.  Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast didn't recall doing. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts?
"
18,5,Randy,"No. I didn't. 
"
18,5,Stephen,"I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them.
"
18,5,Randy,"What might be?
"
18,5,Stephen,"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy??
"
18,5,Randy,"...Drones are spooky?
"
18,5,Stephen,"If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby.
"
18,5,Anchor,"The town of South Park has become a hotbed of tension with civilians lashing out at police. After police used excessive force at a peaceful protest, the town has now broken out into full-scale riots.  As the people of South Park continue to protest, the South Park police are now ordering a mandatory reverse curfew. The governor has asked for help from the National Guard to bring order to the town.
"
18,5,Announcer,"Tonight on an all-new 20/20.  A town in crisis over the matter of privacy.  Now for the first time we sit down and talk to the mom behind the bush.
"
18,5,Reporter,"You've become sort of a poster child for privacy and drone issues.
"
18,5,Laura,"I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where police drones are monitoring Neighborhood Watch drones. I mean, where does it stop?
"
18,5,Reporter,"It just... keeps going on and on. Kind of like your...  I mean... it just... goes outside what most people would call... acceptable.
"
18,5,Laura,"Have you ever seen pictures of naked women before 2005?! It's not that weird!
"
18,5,Thomas,"It's okay, honey.
"
18,5,Reporter,"I didn't see the video. I don't believe in doing that, but uh... I'm just saying that... the situation in in your town is... unwieldy? 
"
18,5,Stephen,"Please do not adjust your televisions!
"
18,5,Reporter,"What is that?
"
18,5,Stephen,"My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby.  All of you with drones, please listen to me. Three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the Internet. We all were told to respectfully not watch the video. But on the page,  it has over three hundred million views, so if none of us watched it, who did?  We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Oh hey Butters. Sup?
"
18,5,Butters,"Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Dude, what's the matter?
"
18,5,Butters,"I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
"
18,5,Cartman,"Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. 
"
18,5,Butters,"I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters.
"
18,5,Butters,"I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.
"
18,5,Butters,"I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
"
18,5,Butters,"You do?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
"
18,5,Butters,"What?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Your dad's drone.
"
18,5,Butters,"NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
"
18,5,Butters,"...Okay.
"
18,5,Stephen,"Time to end this hobby once and for all!  No! NOOOO!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.
"
18,5,Butters,"If this doesn't work, we're dead.
"
18,5,Cartman,"It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. 
"
18,5,Stephen,"We're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said ""No more!"" Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children's children will still be telling stories about how Craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away. 
"
18,5,Minstrel,"Have you heard the tale of Craig's mom's bush
And the night that it saved us from drones?
Nobody knew the power it had.
They just thought it was shaggy and gross.
Craig's mom live a life of shame and despair
Everyone feared her great giant bush!
"
18,5,Laura,"They didn't!
"
18,5,Minstrel,"But then when drones were filling the sky,
She unfurled her bush and she used it to fly.
Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush.
Gargantuan thicket of madness.
Bigger than earth and denser than gold.
Truly a magical bush to behold.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.  ""Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass.""
"
18,5,Butters,"Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.
"
18,5,Butters,"No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
"
18,5,Cartman,"You're welcome. 
"
18,5,Minstrel,"And she flew and she flew away into the sun
And then she died.
Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush.
Truly a magical bush to behold.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Oh! Hey Kyle!  Kyle, hang on a sec. 
"
18,6,Kyle,"Hey Jimmy. What's up?
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Oh. Really?
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?
"
18,6,Kyle,"Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"You betcha, pal. 
"
18,6,Announcer,"The Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game.  In this game, you are Terrance & Phillip. Can you collect all the Canadian coins? *poot* 
"
18,6,Announcer,"That's one coin. Can you collect more?  You've collected ten Canadian coins!  Congratulations!  Hey, you're really good at this, guy!
"
18,6,Kyle,"What?
"
18,6,Butters,"Congratulations, Kyle.
"
18,6,Announcer,"With Canada coins, you can buy stuff that helps Terrance & Phillip rebuild Canada.  Run around and collect more coins, or better yet, buy them in bulk!  How many Canadian coins would you like to buy?
"
18,6,Kyle,"This is stupid!
"
18,6,Butters,"Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 
"
18,6,Announcer,"You buy 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents! You're amazing! Now use that Canadough to help rebuild Canada! Click to build a hospital here. 
"
18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"Yaaay!
"
18,6,Kyle,"It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
"
18,6,Cartman,"What are you two boners doing?
"
18,6,Butters,"We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
"
18,6,Cartman,"I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Who makes this crap?
"
18,6,Minister,"Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day!
"
18,6,Prince,"Where is the roof on this thing?
"
18,6,Terrance,"What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!
"
18,6,Minister,"Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies?
"
18,6,Phillip,"What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!
"
18,6,Prince,"Oh, I'm only the Prince of Canada! And this happens to be the Minister of Mobile Gaming.
"
18,6,Minister,"We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.
"
18,6,Phillip,"It's the dumbest game over! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!
"
18,6,Prince,"Ey! We know the game's not great, but who cares? It's free!
"
18,6,Phillip,"But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!
"
18,6,Minister,"They see through the charade.
"
18,6,Prince,"Uh oh, you think so?
"
18,6,Minister,"I think they see through the charade, yes.
"
18,6,Prince,"I'm pretty sure they can hear us too. 
"
18,6,Minister,"Alright, fuck it! You've seen through the charade, so you might as well know everything. Charade up!  Allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming. For years gaming was simple. You pay for the game and you enjoy. With mobile apps we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid. But if you pay for incentives, you're rewarded!
"
18,6,Prince,"Free""mium"". The ""mium"" is Latin for ""not really.""
"
18,6,Minister,"It's a simple cycle. A never-ending loop based on RPG. Explore. Collect. Spend. Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money.
"
18,6,Prince,"It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun.
"
18,6,Randy,"You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! 
"
18,6,Stan,"I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.
"
18,6,Randy,"You didn't realize! What are ""Canadian coins""?
"
18,6,Stan,"You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
"
18,6,Randy,"Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!
"
18,6,Stan,"I'll pay you back for it, okay?!
"
18,6,Randy,"How?!
"
18,6,Stan,"I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!
"
18,6,Randy,"Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!  I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.
"
18,6,Sharon,"Wull whattaya mean?
"
18,6,Randy,"Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?
"
18,6,Sharon,"Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.
"
18,6,Randy,"I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.
"
18,6,Minister,"And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles. Entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing chachings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-
"
18,6,Prince,"So they'll forget they're spending money.
"
18,6,Minister,"-and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.
"
18,6,Phillip,"We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?
"
18,6,Minister,"No no! It has to be just barely fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun. 
"
18,6,Terrance,"What's this?
"
18,6,Prince,"Your checks of course. For ten million American dollars. Each.
"
18,6,Terrance,"So this is- Everyone is doing this?
"
18,6,Minister,"Ehhhveryone is doing it.
"
18,6,Phillip,"It's just the way things are going?
"
18,6,Minister,"It's the way things are going!
"
18,6,Terrance,"Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.
"
18,6,Terrance,"Hey Phillip! 
"
18,6,Stan,"Ohhh hey guys.
"
18,6,Kyle,"You... missed school today?
"
18,6,Stan,"Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
"
18,6,Stan,"Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
"
18,6,Cartman,"How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
"
18,6,Stan,"Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 
"
18,6,Kyle,"You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
"
18,6,Stan,"You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
"
18,6,Cartman,"Yes.
"
18,6,Stan,"It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?
"
18,6,Cartman,"Jimmy told me about this game.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Kenny, who told you about this game?
"
18,6,Kenny,"(Jimmy.)
"
18,6,Kyle,"Dude, what?!
"
18,6,Cartman,"The?!
"
18,6,Kenny,"(Fuck?!)
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here.  Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?
"
18,6,Boy,"What do you mean?
"
18,6,Jimmy,"The Terrance & Phillip mobile game.  All the cool kids are usin' it.
"
18,6,Boy,"Aw, I don't know.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff.  It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? 
"
18,6,Kyle,"Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Why sure fellas.  Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing?!
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
"
18,6,Kyle,"You need to stop recommending that app to people!
"
18,6,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
18,6,Cartman,"Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
"
18,6,Jimmy,"I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.
"
18,6,Cartman,"It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
"
18,6,Kyle,"Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Alright alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff.
"
18,6,Kyle,"You just push it on other people?!
"
18,6,Jimmy,"They pay me to!
"
18,6,Kyle,"Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!
"
18,6,Prince,"You've both done an amazing job. New hospitals, new neighborhoods, all funded by one freemium game.
"
18,6,Terrance,"Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.
"
18,6,Minister,"Oh. Ah what is the matter?
"
18,6,Phillip,"It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. 
"
18,6,Prince,"But just look at all the things we're getting to build. Soon, Canada will be as advanced and developed as Michigan.
"
18,6,Terrance,"We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.
"
18,6,Minister,"Hoh non! Well, we certainly wouldn't want that!  Oh! I have an idea! How about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and, we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in ""moderation""?
"
18,6,Prince,"Ohhhhh. 
"
18,6,Phillip,"Do you really think that would help?
"
18,6,Minister,"Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time!
"
18,6,Announcer,"You. Friends. Fun. Drink. Hot girls. You're hot. Drink more. Expensive cars. Ass, drink, ass, money, you in a tuxedo, threesomes, vodka, pussy, drink, drink, drink, you, drink, Vegas, fun, pussy, you, in a tuxedo, fucking this girl, vodka, drink drink drink drink it all you fucking pussy! MORE TUXEDOS, MORE CARS, MORE PUSSY, MORE VODKA, DRINK DRINK DRINK!  Please drink responsibly.
"
18,6,Randy,"Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.  Come on Dad, we're going home.
"
18,6,Marvin,"I'm going.
"
18,6,Randy,"Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
"
18,6,Marvin,"What are you talkin' about?
"
18,6,Randy,"I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
"
18,6,Stan,"It's just...
"
18,6,Marvin,"It's fun.
"
18,6,Stan,"Yeah, it's fun.
"
18,6,Randy,"It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
"
18,6,Marvin,"Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!
"
18,6,Randy,"I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  It's called a tasting, and it's classy!
"
18,6,Stan,"Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
"
18,6,Marvin,"Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop.
"
18,6,Randy,"All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.  HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman.  People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.
"
18,6,Kyle,"But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
"
18,6,Cartman,"How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
"
18,6,Cartman,"And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
"
18,6,Jimmy,"I needed the money, alright?!  I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!
"
18,6,Kyle,"You have your crutches!
"
18,6,Jimmy,"It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.
"
18,6,Cartman,"That makes sense.
"
18,6,Kyle,"You're saging these games do this on purpose?!
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing.
"
18,6,Voice Notification,"Hey buddih. Come on, guy.  Come back, friend. You've got new buddies, guy.  We've just given you 5000 Canadian coins.  Enjoy you Canadough.
"
18,6,Stan,"...Free? 
"
18,6,Randy,"What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!
"
18,6,Stan,"I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
"
18,6,Randy,"$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!
"
18,6,Stan,"One?
"
18,6,Randy,"Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!
"
18,6,Stan,"No, no, it's not.
"
18,6,Randy,"You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!
"
18,6,Stan,"I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
"
18,6,Randy,"I am not chugging beer!  I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! 
"
18,6,Stan,"Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?
"
18,6,Kyle,"Sure. Come on, guys. 
"
18,6,Jimmy,"This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic.
"
18,6,Stan,"It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help.
"
18,6,Stan,"How?
"
18,6,Jimmy,"What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say ""I have a problem."" And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. 
"
18,6,Kyle,"We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
"
18,6,Cartman,"It's done. 
"
18,6,Kyle,"Wuh, what's done?
"
18,6,Cartman,"The word is out.  ""Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts."" I tweeted it.  It's trending.
"
18,6,Terrance,"You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!
"
18,6,Prince,"You what?
"
18,6,Minister,"Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game.
"
18,6,Phillip,"But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!
"
18,6,Terrance,"You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!
"
18,6,Prince,"Minister of mobile gaming, what's this all aboot?
"
18,6,Minister,"Alright, alright, you've seen through the charade again. Let me explain how freemium games really work.  The truth is, a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them. It's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them. That's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents.
"
18,6,Terrance,"But then all our profits come from people with problems.
"
18,6,Minister,"Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke.
"
18,6,Phillip,"Okay, but we still won't stand for this!
"
18,6,Stan,"I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 
"
18,6,Satan,"You have summoned the Prince of Temptation! For what purpose?!
"
18,6,Stan,"Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
"
18,6,Satan,"Then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soul!  So you got dopa-mine, right? That's the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable, like eating, sex, and that's just nature, right? Like rabbits and fish and shit. They need dopa mine so that they want to consume and reproduce.
"
18,6,Stan,"Okay.
"
18,6,Satan,"But because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it, it's easy for them to overdo and have dopa-mine problems. You know, it's not fuckin' rocket science, this stuff.
"
18,6,Stan,"So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
"
18,6,Satan,"Fuck no! It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopa-mine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life.
"
18,6,Stan,"So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
"
18,6,Satan,"Yeah, that's pretty much what it means.
"
18,6,Stan,"The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
"
18,6,Satan,"Well who's not filling a fuckin' hole? Right? You know, I mean what kind of bullshit is that? So, let's talk about genetics now. You still have time?
"
18,6,Stan,"Yeah, no, this is great.
"
18,6,Satan,"Okay, let me get some visual aids. Gimme juuust a sec.
"
18,6,Minister,"Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers.
"
18,6,Phillip,"Oh God, he just doesn't stop!
"
18,6,Terrance,"Who IS this guy?!
"
18,6,Minister,"We're building a new Canada with micropayments from addicts! Who cares?! You think the fucking alcohol industry cares?! They don't care that 10% are gonna get addicted, they're counting on it!! It's the same with ut! But we've got our eye on every addict's screen! Every button they click, we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats!
"
18,6,Phillip,"Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!
"
18,6,Minister,"Hohon, I'm much worse than the Devil.  I'm the Canadian Devil. 
"
18,6,Terrance,"Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!
"
18,6,Phillip,"Beelzeboot!
"
18,6,Beelzeboot,"You discovered my plan, but too late!  Now the souls of all Canadians belong to me!
"
18,6,Terrance,"Oh no!
"
18,6,Prince,"Oh, what have I done?!
"
18,6,Beelzeboot,"Heheheh! Hahaha! 
"
18,6,Satan,"So basically, the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with, um, dopa-mine regulation, and that's why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuff. Okay, so we kind of understand now, champ?
"
18,6,Stan,"I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
"
18,6,Satan,"You know, they all do it, and it's kind of my deal, I have to put temptation out there too so people have free will and all that shit. But you know, everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay.
"
18,6,Voice Notification,"*Ding* Ey, buddy, where'd you go? Don't you want more Canadough?
"
18,6,Satan,"What's this?
"
18,6,Stan,"That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 
"
18,6,Satan,"What, you just collect coints?
"
18,6,Announcer,"How much money can you buy today?
"
18,6,Satan,"No, see, if something's addictive because it's fun, that's one thing. But this is just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Wait a minute. Who put this out?
"
18,6,Stan,"Ah, Canada?
"
18,6,Satan,"Oh that son of a bitch! He's always doing this shit! I tell him, ""temptation has to be nuanced!"" but he goes and does this crap again! I'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick, kid. Is that alright?
"
18,6,Stan,"...Okay.  Aaaaahhh!
"
18,6,Randy,"Oh pass interference! Interference! 
"
18,6,Sharon,"Stan, where are you going? 
"
18,6,Stan,"I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 
"
18,6,Randy,"Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. 
"
18,6,NC 9 Reporter,"Horror and sadness all over Canada tonight. When the Prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game, he apparently made a deal with the Canadian Devil.
"
18,6,Beelzeboot,"Hey, guy, I'm the Canadian Devil. 
"
18,6,NC 9 Reporter,"The Canadian Devil now has complete control of the soul of every Canadian. This is a sad day for Canada, and therefore, the world. 
"
18,6,Beelzeboot,"Heh heheheh, stab you. 
"
18,6,Satan,"Beelzeboot! Once again you lack any sense of nuance!
"
18,6,Phillip,"Who the fuck is that?
"
18,6,Beelzeboot,"Well well, my overachieving doppelganger! You're no match for Canadian Satan! 
"
18,6,Satan,"Return from whence you came! 
"
18,6,Beelzeboot,"Ow! Watch it, guy! 
"
18,6,NC 9 Reporter,"Sadly, a shocking turn of events here as the actual Devil has now appeared and seems to be fighting the Canadian Devil! This is certainly a conundrum for Canadians everywhere as we try to figure out who to root for. For that, let's ask the Minister of Sports in Edmonton. 
"
18,6,Minister of Sports,"Well of course, the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the Canadian Devil. But then again, he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years.
"
18,6,Canadian,"Screw that, go Canada!
"
18,6,Satan,"Enough, Beelzeboot! Thy end has come. 
"
18,6,Kyle,"Hey dude.
"
18,6,Stan,"Hey.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Y-you alright?
"
18,6,Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
"
18,6,Cartman,"Cool.
"
18,6,Prince,"My fellow Canadians, what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others. We have all learned a tragic lesson together: that though many sins are out there, when you get involved with freemium gaming, you are making a deal with the Canadian Devil. We will no longer make freemium games, and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts. Canada is back to being an ethical, respected, and shitty tundra. 
"
18,6,Stan,"I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
"
18,6,Marvin,"Well okay, good idea. 
"
18,6,Randy,"What are you gaywads doin'?
"
18,6,Stan,"We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
"
18,6,Randy,"Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. 
"
18,6,Stan,"That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
"
18,6,Randy,"It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.
"
18,6,Stan,"Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. 
"
18,6,Randy,"You guys wanna put some money on it? 
"
18,7,Butters,"WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.
"
18,7,Stan,"Butters, what the hell are you doing?
"
18,7,Butters,"I feel Stan! He looks totally real!
"
18,7,Cartman,"That's awesome, Butters.  Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? 
"
18,7,Butters,"More of the school. 
"
18,7,Clyde,"What are you doing, Butters?
"
18,7,Butters,"The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.
"
18,7,Butters,"Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters, no! Are you crazy?!
"
18,7,Butters,"What what what?
"
18,7,Cartman,"What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
"
18,7,Butters,"Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!
"
18,7,Cartman,"You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
"
18,7,Butters,"I'm sorry!
"
18,7,Cartman,"You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
"
18,7,Butters,"Yeah.
"
18,7,Cartman,"You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
"
18,7,Butters,"Oh Jesus! 
"
18,7,Butters,"Okay, I'm back in your room!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!
"
18,7,Butters,"Suppornity window dropped. 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Welcome back, dude.
"
18,7,Butters,"Wow! That was cool!
"
18,7,Cartman,"How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
"
18,7,Butters,"I touched Wendy's boobs. 
"
18,7,Cartman,"And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, ""Whoa, I'm back.""  Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!
"
18,7,Stan,"Sound pretty typical to me.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!
"
18,7,Kyle,"Coup de grah, Cartman
"
18,7,Cartman,"Thank you, Kyle.
"
18,7,Stan,"Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
"
18,7,Butters,"Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
"
18,7,Butters,"You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said ""Well, technically I was in school."" Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?
"
18,7,Butters,"Yeah. 
"
18,7,Cartman,"See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
"
18,7,Butters,"Well, not a hundred percent...
"
18,7,Cartman,"Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. 
"
18,7,Butters,"Okay, subject is ready.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.  Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
"
18,7,Butters,"Interim status is go.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 
"
18,7,Butters,"It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
"
18,7,Cartman,"All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
"
18,7,Butters,"Going now! 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
"
18,7,Butters,"Okay.
"
18,7,Butters,"How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
"
18,7,Cartman,"You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
"
18,7,Butters,"Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
"
18,7,Butters,"There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Just take the money, Butters! 
"
18,7,Butters,"Okay, I got it!
"
18,7,Cartman,"You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.
"
18,7,Butters,"Already? Oh no!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.  Are you heading back Butters?  Butters?  Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.
"
18,7,Butters,"I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 
"
18,7,Stephen,"There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?!
"
18,7,Butters,"Hello Dad! It's me, Butters!
"
18,7,Stephen,"I know that! What do you-?
"
18,7,Butters,"This is for all the times I got grounded! 
"
18,7,Stephen,"Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh!
"
18,7,Butters,"HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!
"
18,7,Linda,"Butters, why?? Oh my God!
"
18,7,Butters,"Huh, that was incredible!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
"
18,7,Butters,"I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 
"
18,7,Driver,"What the hell are you doing, Kid?!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
"
18,7,Butters,"Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
"
18,7,Driver,"Hey! 
"
18,7,Butters,"Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now
"
18,7,Cartman,"Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now?
"
18,7,Butters,"Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
"
18,7,Butters,"I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Wait, hang on Butters!
"
18,7,Butters,"Take that, you dumb hooker!
"
18,7,Hooker,"What you doin' motherfucker?!
"
18,7,Butters,"I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
"
18,7,Butters,"I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters?? Butters?? 
"
18,7,Dr. Carroll,"You're very lucky, young man. You've got a couple of hairline fractures, but the knife missed your spleen by half an inch.
"
18,7,Butters,"I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
"
18,7,Dr. Carroll,"No, you actually got stabbed by a hooker. We've called your parents and they're on their way. Your dad wanted me to let you know that you're grounded more than you can possibly imagine.
"
18,7,Butters,"Aw nuts!
"
18,7,Dr. Carroll,"Try and relax, and when your parents get here we'll sort this all out. 
"
18,7,Butters,"I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters. 
"
18,7,Butters,"Ahhh!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Are you okay?
"
18,7,Butters,"Eric! Uh what are you doing here?
"
18,7,Cartman,"I'm not here, Butters.
"
18,7,Butters,"What?
"
18,7,Cartman,"This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...  is real.
"
18,7,Butters,"Nuh uh!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. 
"
18,7,Butters,"WHAT?? 
"
18,7,Cartman,"You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. 
"
18,7,Butters,"Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
"
18,7,Butters,"Ah how do you know that?!
"
18,7,Cartman,"How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? 
"
18,7,Nurse,"Everything okay in here?
"
18,7,Butters,"Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!
"
18,7,Nurse,"O-kay. 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters.
"
18,7,Butters,"NO!
"
18,7,Cartman,"I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! 
"
18,7,Butters,"AAAAAAHAHAH! 
"
18,7,Kyle,"Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
"
18,7,Cartman,"I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello?
"
18,7,Steve,"Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help.
"
18,7,Cartman,"With what?
"
18,7,Steve,"This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Fuck you!
"
18,7,Steve,"I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten.
"
18,7,Kyle,"You should probably listen to him, dude.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
"
18,7,Steve,"The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Maybe we are.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.
"
18,7,Steve,"I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! 
"
18,7,Liane,"Eric? Poopsiekins?  Eric?  Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now.  I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat?  All right, I'll just leave it here, hon.  I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.
"
18,7,Stephen,"What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!
"
18,7,Butters,"Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
"
18,7,Stephen,"Oh no, mister! You are GROUNDED! 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Are you fucking with me?!
"
18,7,Butters,"...What? What do you mean?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
"
18,7,Butters,"I don't know what you mean.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Because if you are, it's not cool!
"
18,7,Butters,"Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
"
18,7,Butters,"Oh really? Oh, that's a relief.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
"
18,7,Butters,"Oh gosh!
"
18,7,Cartman,"That's right!
"
18,7,Butters,"OH GOSH!
"
18,7,Cartman,"THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
"
18,7,Butters,"Yeah.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! 
"
18,7,Kyle,"Hello?
"
18,7,Butters,"Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!
"
18,7,Kyle,"Again?
"
18,7,Butters,"No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
"
18,7,Kyle,"Uh huh.
"
18,7,Butters,"I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
"
18,7,Kyle,"Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
"
18,7,Butters,"PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
"
18,7,Stephen,"Butters?! Who is that?!
"
18,7,Butters,"Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- 
"
18,7,Kenny,"(You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!) 
"
18,7,Kenny,"(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)
"
18,7,Kyle,"You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
"
18,7,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
18,7,Kyle,"Fuck you!
"
18,7,Kenny,"(What??)
"
18,7,Kyle,"Get up, Cartman!
"
18,7,Kenny,"(This isn't a prank, Kyle!)
"
18,7,Kyle,"Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!
"
18,7,Stan,"Kyle, maybe this is for real.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Fuck you if you're in on this.
"
18,7,Stan,"In on what?  Ohh,  Fuck you!
"
18,7,Steve,"Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares.  That's right, there is nothing we can do. All right. Have I answered all your customer concerns in a timely, polite manner? Thank you for calling Korean Airlines Customer Service.  El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
"
18,7,Steve,"Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend.  Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
"
18,7,Steve,"Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?
"
18,7,Kyle,"Kyle.
"
18,7,Steve,"Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?
"
18,7,Kyle,"I don't care!
"
18,7,Steve,"He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems.
"
18,7,Kyle,"You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
"
18,7,Steve,"Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Fuck you!
"
18,7,Stan,"""Fuck you"" what?
"
18,7,Kyle,"He said they're doing a Total Recall.
"
18,7,Stan,"Oh fuck you!
"
18,7,Steve,"All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?
"
18,7,Kyle,"You haven't done anything yet!
"
18,7,Steve,"But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns?
"
18,7,Kyle,"We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
"
18,7,Steve,"Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend? 
"
18,7,Cartman,"It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. 
"
18,7,Kyle,"Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
"
18,7,Cartman,"I know. Let's go to the backyard. 
"
18,7,Kyle,"Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Okay Kyle.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
"
18,7,Kyle,"Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Mmmhmm.
"
18,7,Kyle,"I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
"
18,7,Cartman,"And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
"
18,7,Kyle,"Www-what do you mean?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Fuck you!
"
18,7,Cartman,"I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Don't... do that!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Calm down.
"
18,7,Kyle,"NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
"
18,7,Cartman,"In virtual reality, yes you did.
"
18,7,Kyle,"No. Then I came into this virtual space.
"
18,7,Cartman,"You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
"
18,7,Kyle,"Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Fuck!
"
18,7,Best Buy Rep,"Thanks for callin' Best Buy. How can I direct your call?
"
18,7,Kyle,"Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Or if I did?
"
18,7,Kyle,"Or if you sold one to an ""Eric Cartman""?
"
18,7,Best Buy Rep,"Sir, I'm gonna have to connect you to Customer Service. Hang on a sec. 
"
18,7,Steve,"Best Buy Customer Service, this is Steve.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Dude... What?
"
18,7,Cartman,"What?  Hello?
"
18,7,Steve,"Yes, hello. This call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
"
18,7,Stephen,"Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember why Butters is grounded? What what did he do?
"
18,7,Linda,"Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.
"
18,7,Stephen,"It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he is grounded.  And no bouncing the racquetball either!
"
18,7,Stan,"No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
"
18,7,Kyle,"Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
"
18,7,Stan,"It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
"
18,7,Stan,"No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
"
18,7,Cartman,"No, you guys. This is virtual reality.
"
18,7,Stan,"How do you know?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Because... I'm a computer program.
"
18,7,Kyle,"God damn it Cartman!
"
18,7,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
"
18,7,Kyle,"He's lying.
"
18,7,Cartman,"I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
"
18,7,Stan,"What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
"
18,7,Steve,"Ohhh yes yes yes! That I can answer! His name was... But-ters!
"
18,7,Stan,"Butters called Customer Service first?
"
18,7,Steve,"Have I answered all your questions in a satisfying and courteous manner?
"
18,7,Stan,"Come on, we're going to Butters' house! 
"
18,7,Steve,"Hello? My friend? My friend, I believe we are having some technical issues with our phone line. Please hang on, I'm going to call Customer Service.
"
18,7,Steve,"Hello, Customer Service, this is Steve.
"
18,7,Steve,"Hello, this is Steve with Customer Service.
"
18,7,Steve,"Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service.
"
18,7,Steve,"Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real.
"
18,7,Steve,"...Ohhh, nohhh, nonononononono.
"
18,7,Steve,"My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop.
"
18,7,Steve,"Ohhh, fuck you!
"
18,7,Steve,"Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion?
"
18,7,Steve,"What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!
"
18,7,Steve,"Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service!
"
18,7,Steve,"But you didn't answer any of my questions!
"
18,7,Steve,"Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?
"
18,7,Butters,"I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 
"
18,7,Stan,"Butters.
"
18,7,Butters,"Huh. But...  you guys can't be here.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Why not?
"
18,7,Butters,"Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
"
18,7,Butters,"When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
"
18,7,Stan,"So now we are in th real world.
"
18,7,Butters,"YES.
"
18,7,Cartman,"You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!
"
18,7,Stephen,"Butters!
"
18,7,Butters,"AAaaghagh!
"
18,7,Stephen,"What are your friends doing here?!
"
18,7,Butters,"Huh I'm sorry Dad!
"
18,7,Steve,"Hello, hello my friend, are you still there?
"
18,7,Stan,"Yes, we're here.
"
18,7,Steve,"Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call Customer Service. This is why you are having problems.
"
18,7,Stephen,"You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!
"
18,7,Stan,"Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
"
18,7,Steve,"That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters!
"
18,7,Stan,"What?! 
"
18,7,Steve,"Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!
"
18,7,Stan,"That doesn't make sense! 
"
18,7,Steve,"That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded! 
"
18,7,Stephen,"Well you're getting it now!
"
18,7,Stan,"Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?
"
18,7,Kyle,"We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
"
18,7,Stan,"Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 
"
18,7,Stephen,"Oh my gosh! Linda!
"
18,7,Linda,"What is it, Stephen?
"
18,7,Stephen,"It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore.
"
18,7,Linda,"He's not?
"
18,7,Stephen,"No. I've I've got to tell him!  Butter? Butters! 
"
18,7,Butters,"Ahhh, huh?
"
18,7,Stephen,"You can go outside and play, son.
"
18,7,Butters,"You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?
"
18,7,Stephen,"No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over.
"
18,7,Butters,"They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!
"
18,7,Stan,"Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
"
18,7,Kyle,"We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
"
18,7,Stan,"Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. 
"
18,7,Kyle,"Alright, dude, take off the headset. 
"
18,7,Kyle,"Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
"
18,7,Stan,"It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.
"
18,7,Butters,"Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore."
18,8,Girl 1,"Hey guys.  Thanks. Support your team? Thank you. Hey guys. Did you get one of these?  Hope you can make it.
"
18,8,Cartman,"What's this?
"
18,8,Girl 1,"The girls volleyball team has a big game tonight and we're just asking for people to come cheer us on.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Girls volleyball?  Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy.
"
18,8,Girl 2,"What's wrong with supporting girls athletics?!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right.
"
18,8,Girl 3,"You know, we're actually in the playoffs, and all we keep hearing is ""We're too busy.""
"
18,8,Kyle,"But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
"
18,8,Girl 3,"What fight?
"
18,8,Stan,"Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
"
18,8,Cartman,"Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
"
18,8,Player,"Alright, I'm going to play a fifth mana card... and then I'm going to attack with my elderbeast- hold on. Wait. Hold on.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Can Kenny block his elderbeast?
"
18,8,Stan,"Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
"
18,8,Cartman,"This asshole needs to make a move already!
"
18,8,Referee,"Quiet in the peanut gallery, please.
"
18,8,Player,"I am attacking, but with a newly summoned spark ghast who has trample. Four damage to your planeswalker.
"
18,8,Boys,"Ohhhh!
"
18,8,Butters,"Oh no! Kenny!
"
18,8,Stan,"Shhh!
"
18,8,Butters,"But he's dying! 
"
18,8,Stan,"What's that?
"
18,8,Cartman,"He's playing an enchantment.
"
18,8,Stan,"This late?
"
18,8,Kyle,"He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
"
18,8,Player,"I can block that with uprooted Minotaur. 
"
18,8,Boys,"Ohhhh!
"
18,8,Referee,"Serendib Sorcerer unblocked. Winner: McCormick!
"
18,8,Boys,"Yeeahhh!
"
18,8,Player,"Nnoohhh!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, it was complete brutality!
"
18,8,Kyle,"You've never seen anything so ruthless!
"
18,8,Stan,"It was seriously almost hard to watch. 
"
18,8,Cartman,"At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
"
18,8,Stan,"Wendy, did you hear about last night?
"
18,8,Wendy,"Yeah, I heard the girls volleyball team won by like 20 points.
"
18,8,Stan,"Not that. Did you actually go to that?
"
18,8,Wendy,"Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.
"
18,8,Stan,"Pfft whatever.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!
"
18,8,Janitor,"Hey! Pssst!  Come over here.  You guys like hard-core stuff, huh?
"
18,8,Cartman,"Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
"
18,8,Janitor,"Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit.
"
18,8,Stan,"We're men.
"
18,8,Janitor,"Well then, if you wanna see REAL fights with REAL brutality, go here.  This is the underground stuff, so keep it quiet.  And you might wanna pack a barf bag.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Kewwwl!
"
18,8,Kyle,"Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
"
18,8,Cartman,"What's hardcore and exciting about City shrimp? 
"
18,8,Kyle,"It doesn't even look like they're open. 
"
18,8,Mr. Tuong,"We crosed! We crosed for the night! Go away prease! 
"
18,8,Stan,"Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?
"
18,8,Mr. Tuong,"You purice?
"
18,8,Kenny,"(What?)
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, do we look like police?
"
18,8,Mr. Tuong,"Okay, come on, come on, five darra, five darra each! Come on, five darra!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Five darrar? 
"
18,8,Mr. Tuong,"You go down! Go down, find seat! We in sixth fight! Gogogogogogogo! 
"
18,8,Announcer,"Scrambles plays a Black Swamp mana card. Fluffy counters with a mana card of his own. And he plays a fugitive wizard!
"
18,8,Crowd,"Ooooooo.
"
18,8,Announcer,"More mana from Scrambles! And yes, that is Crippling Blight! Crippling Blight to the fugitive wizard! Creature now has -1 to strength and defense! More Mana from Fluffy. Now he'll attack with fugitive wizard, and there's an instant attack from Scrambles! That is peel from reality! Fugitive wizard is literally torn apart from the battleground!
"
18,8,The boys,"Whoa!
"
18,8,Announcer,"The mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells! It's Mass Calcify against Into the Void!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, that was total carnage!
"
18,8,Stan,"That was freakin' hardcore.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
"
18,8,Stan,"It was just decimation.
"
18,8,Kyle,"It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
"
18,8,Cartman,"We're going again on Friday, right?
"
18,8,Stan,"Hell yeah! 
"
18,8,Cartman,"What's the matter Kenny?
"
18,8,Kenny,"(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)
"
18,8,Stan,"What's mean about it?
"
18,8,Cartman,"You feel bad for the roosters?
"
18,8,Kenny,"(Yeah, I feel bad for the roosters.)
"
18,8,Stan,"Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
"
18,8,Kenny,"(No.)
"
18,8,Cartman,"Huh? A little bit?
"
18,8,Kenny,"(NO.)
"
18,8,Stan,"Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
"
18,8,Cartman,"What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. 
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us?
"
18,8,Stuart,"What do you mean?
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it.
"
18,8,Stuart,"What's cock Magic?
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play ""Magic: the Gathering,"" and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?
"
18,8,Stuart,"I don't go to any cock Magic fights!
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong. And anyone I find involved with this filth is going down!
"
18,8,Randy,"Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!
"
18,8,Stan,"Dad, it's not that big a deal.
"
18,8,Randy,"It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.
"
18,8,Kyle,"You were?
"
18,8,Randy,"Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. 
"
18,8,Stan,"Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.
"
18,8,Randy,"Oh? Not impressed? How about this? 
"
18,8,Voice,"What is it?!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play ""Magic: The Gathering""?
"
18,8,Voice,"Never heard of cock Magic, or roosters.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.
"
18,8,Breeder,"Come on to the back, don't mind the smell.  We only deal in the highest quality poultry planeswalkers. Are you looking for a New Hampshire or a Cornish breed?
"
18,8,Kyle,"We don't... really know the difference.
"
18,8,Breeder,"Well, your New Hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana. These here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards. And here you got your green mana necromancers. Lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue- or black-stacked decks.
"
18,8,Stan,"Do you think they're happy?
"
18,8,Breeder,"Do I think they're happy?
"
18,8,Stan,"Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play ""Magic: The Gathering""?
"
18,8,Breeder,"They're fuckin' chickens.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
"
18,8,Breeder,"Free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh Kenny?
"
18,8,Stan,"Hey, how about this little guy?
"
18,8,Breeder,"That one's kind of young. I don't even know what kinda cards he prefers.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Then he's perfect for us.
"
18,8,Cartman,"What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about ""McNuggets""?
"
18,8,Kyle,"Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
"
18,8,Cartman,"""Yes I do, you guys.""  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?
"
18,8,Shelley,"Mom, will you tell Dad to get out of the bathroom?! He's been in there for an hour!
"
18,8,Sharon,"Randy?
"
18,8,Randy,"Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!
"
18,8,Sharon,"Randy, what are you doing?!
"
18,8,Randy,"Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey!
"
18,8,Sharon,"Randy, why are there drums playing? 
"
18,8,Randy,"All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.
"
18,8,Sharon,"Ohhh, no no nononononono no.
"
18,8,Randy,"Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.
"
18,8,Sharon,"I know that's why you got kicked out of college.
"
18,8,Randy,"Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.
"
18,8,Sharon,"Stanley??
"
18,8,Randy,"People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Oh my gosh! 
"
18,8,Announcer,"Reuben casts Silklash Spider. Silklash Spider can block as if it had Flying! And now he casts Geistflame, dealing one damage to McNuggets.
"
18,8,Cartmen,"Come on, McNuggets! Fight!
"
18,8,Kyle,"You can do it, McNuggets! 
"
18,8,Announcer,"Quite please.
"
18,8,Someone,"I think I'll bet on the next one.
"
18,8,Announcer,"Waaiitt!  McNuggets has cast Punishing Fire, absorbing the Geistflame and dealing two damage to the opponent! Game, set and match, McNuggets!
"
18,8,Crowd,"Whoa!
"
18,8,Stan,"Yeah!
"
18,8,Cartman,"All right McNuggets!
"
18,8,Kyle,"All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
"
18,8,Cartman,"That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular ""Magic: The Gathering"" look like girls volleyball.
"
18,8,Promoter,"Excuse me. That was pretty impressive down there. You boys have a nice cock.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Thank you so very much.
"
18,8,Promoter,"I've never seen a rooster throw down spells with such raw brutality. How would you like to move him up to the big time?
"
18,8,Kyle,"You mean there's more to this?
"
18,8,Promoter,"Oh yes. And I'm not talking about the basement of some seedy Chinese restaurant, I'm talking about the basement of a well-established Chinese franchise. Saturday night, here's the address.  Let's see what kind of money your cock can really make.
"
18,8,Stan,"Gee, thanks!
"
18,8,Cartman,"You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
"
18,8,Woman,"Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on.
"
18,8,Kindergarten boy,"Yay, a show, a show!
"
18,8,Woman,"Do you kids like magic?
"
18,8,Kindergartners,"Yeah, yay!
"
18,8,Woman,"Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randi! 
"
18,8,Randy,"Hey kids, are we having fun?  Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? 
"
18,8,Woman,"Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready.
"
18,8,Randy,"Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic...  you'll find that-  Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!
"
18,8,Man,"They're getting a kick out the magician, huh?
"
18,8,Randy,"Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you! 
"
18,8,Kindergarten boy,"I hate you!
"
18,8,Stan,"Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
"
18,8,Kyle,"It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
"
18,8,Craig,"Where was all this?
"
18,8,Cartman,"We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Yeah, you gotta know people.
"
18,8,Butters,"Dangit, I wish I knew people.
"
18,8,Mr. Garrison,"All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. 
"
18,8,Coach,"Thank you, Mr. Garrison. Listen uh, last night we had a pretty big game against Evergreen. The girls really hammered 'em, but once again we're a... little disappointed in the turnout.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.
"
18,8,Butters,"Yeah.
"
18,8,Coach,"You know, when you put your all into something, it's kind of a bummer when people don't seem to care.  Kind of makes you feel like the sport you love is becoming a joke.
"
18,8,Stan,"Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
"
18,8,Cartman,"OOHHH!! 
"
18,8,Jimmy,"Fantastic girls volleyball joke, Stan.
"
18,8,Coach,"The girls wanted to say something, so we're now going to hear a few words from the captain of the girls volleyball team.
"
18,8,Wendy,"Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. 
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.
"
18,8,Man,"And then he uh, took his penis from behind our daughter's ear and uh, we uh, uh that's when we saw him with uh, the n-the three rings. and uh, his penis, he was pulling it through 'em somehow, uh.
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that? 
"
18,8,Man,"Well that's what I'm telling you. It was right here exce-except for the thing where he poured the milk into his penis; he did that over there.
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?
"
18,8,Woman,"Decks??
"
18,8,Man,"Who? There weren't any ""decks.""
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?
"
18,8,Woman,"I'm so confused, babe.
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!
"
18,8,Man,"Nobody paid us anything! Now, there has been a crime here and you'd better do something about it!
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"Agreed! Who first called 911? 
"
18,8,Woman,"Please! Don't take me away from my child!
"
18,8,Girl,"Mommy!
"
18,8,Kyle,"This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. 
"
18,8,Manager,"Sorry, Panda Express is crosed. We crosed!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
"
18,8,Manager,"Oh okay, come on, ten darra, ten darra.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Ten darra?! 
"
18,8,Announcer 2,"For the next round, it is Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds, versus Clucky
"
18,8,Cartman,"Who is that??
"
18,8,Spectator 1,"That's Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds.  He's never lost a fight. Hell, he's never even lost one health!
"
18,8,Stan,"What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
"
18,8,Kyle,"McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
"
18,8,Cartman,"McNuggets is scared, dude!
"
18,8,Stan,"Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
"
18,8,Spectator 2,"He didn't stand a chance. Not one spell cast before he was obliterated by health drains! That thing isn't human! 
"
18,8,Promoter,"Alright, your rooster's up next, boys.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
"
18,8,Promoter,"He doesn't have a choice
"
18,8,Cartman,"This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
"
18,8,Promoter,"What do you think all these people are here to see?
"
18,8,Cartman,"Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
"
18,8,Promoter,"The hell you do! Get your cock in there! 
"
18,8,ESPN Announcer,"You're watching ESPN Illegal. Your source for bullfighting, dogfighting, and cock Magic.
"
18,8,ESPN Host,"And a warm welcome back to the Cock Magic Championships. Certainly an electric atmosphere here in the basement of Panda Express. The fight we were expecting, of course, Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds versus ten-month-old Cornish rooster McNuggets. In a complete shocker, the challenger McNuggets has been scratched and substituting for him is nine-year-old Kenny McCormick. Never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock Magic. Let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for Gadnuk's sixth move.  Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds plays a creature card. 
"
18,8,Cartman,"Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
"
18,8,Crowd,"Whooaa.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Come on, Kenny! 
"
18,8,Stan,"What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
"
18,8,Kyle,"He just had to shuffle it.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.
"
18,8,Stan,"Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 
"
18,8,ESPN Host,"A second Elvish Mystic now, and Gadnuk attacks with Merciful Pretender. McCormick sends Charging Rhino to the graveyard. He's desperate now. Not too much he can-OH! And he's just laid down Life's Legacy!
"
18,8,Crowd,"Ooooohh...
"
18,8,ESPN Host,"That was not expected! Gadnuk doesn't know what hit him! McCormick follows with Crackling Doom and Abzan Battle Priest!
"
18,8,Kyle,"Holy shit, dude!
"
18,8,ESPN Host,"Gadnuk tries to block with Living Totem but OH, there is Terra Stomper! This is absolute savagery! Frenzied Goblin has been sent to the graveyard and now there is no one to block Pearl Lake Ancient! My God, someone has to put a stop to this!
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"Freeze!  Well, well! Looks like I finally caught the big boys! You're all going to jail for a long time!  Especially you, scumbag!
"
18,8,Promoter,"Lousy cops! How did you find us?
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"We saw your fliers.  ""Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm.""
"
18,8,Promoter,"We didn't put those fliers out!
"
18,8,Announcer,"And now, for your halftime entertainment, please welcome... the incomparable, the beautiful, the Amazingly Randi! 
"
18,8,Cartman,"Ah, dude, your dad's here.
"
18,8,Randy,"Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing.  Whatever you believe is real, is real. 
"
18,8,Head,"Come on Barbie, let's go party. 
"
18,8,Spectator 3,"Ewww! 
"
18,8,Randy,"Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"I'll volunteer.
"
18,8,Randy,"Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?
"
18,8,Det. Harris,"I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police.
"
18,8,Randy,"All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir? 
"
18,8,Cartman,"It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
"
18,8,Butters,"Wow, the cops came?
"
18,8,Kyle,"Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
"
18,8,Kenny,"(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)
"
18,8,Kyle,"Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
"
18,8,Stan,"Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Got what?
"
18,8,Stan,"A way to finally do something good for other people.
"
18,8,Announcer,"South Park serves, and McNuggets plays a Plains Land card. One-nill, South Park.  Another serve, and McNuggets summons Downtreader Elk. One south Park player is eliminated. You, the girl with the ponytails - you are dead.
"
18,10,Kyle,"It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.
"
18,10,Cartman,"Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
"
18,10,Girl,"Grandpa!
"
18,10,Kyle,"I'm NOT a GRANDPA!
"
18,10,Kyle,"But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom
"
18,10,Kyle,"Whattaya think?
"
18,10,Butters,"Hmmm, it's kind of gay.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Really??
"
18,10,Butters,"I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
"
18,10,Kyle,"Hm, I wasn't really going for ""gay,"" I was more going for ""wholesome.""
"
18,10,Butters,"Well, gay is wholesome.
"
18,10,Kyle,"But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
"
18,10,Sheila,"Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Bill Cosby.
"
18,10,Sheila,"Yes.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Is here. To see me.
"
18,10,Sheila,"Yes. 
"
18,10,Bill Cosby,"Oh! There he is comin' down the stairs.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Hello.
"
18,10,Bill Cosby,"Hello, son. Your savethelivingroom hash tag is getting a lot of attention and we think it's great.
"
18,10,Kyle,"We?
"
18,10,Bill Cosby,"I'm just a small part of a big epic holiday special, which is gonna air this weekend.  It's a shame how families don't gather in their living rooms like they used to, and we think a big holiday special is just the thing America needs now.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Wow.  Well that's awesome!
"
18,10,Bill Cosby,"Well the producers of the show saw how much your idea was trending and thought we should get your hash-tag on board with ours.
"
18,10,Kyle,"M-Ah, I'd love to.
"
18,10,Bill Cosby,"Great! I'll go right now and tell them you're on board. We've gotta do this quickly!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Uh okay! No problem! 
"
18,10,Bill Cosby,"This holiday special is gonna bring families together again, son!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!
"
18,10,Bill Cosby,"Happy Holidays! 
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?
"
18,10,Randy,"Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.
"
18,10,Officer 1,"Who's the famous artist?
"
18,10,Randy,"Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"You're Lorde.
"
18,10,Sharon,"The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him.
"
18,10,Officer 1,"You mean the girl who just showed her asshole on Jimmy Fallon?
"
18,10,Randy,"No! That was a copy of me!
"
18,10,Officer 2,"Right. The thing that I jacked off to was you! Huh! 
"
18,10,Randy,"Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!
"
18,10,Officer 3,"Detective Harris! Sir! We've got a problem!
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"What is it, Adams?
"
18,10,Adams,"We've arrested a black man who was snooping around the old Jefferson estate!
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Did you choke him?
"
18,10,Adams,"Yes!
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Did you shoot him?
"
18,10,Adams,"YES!
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"So what's the problem?
"
18,10,Adams,"He... appears to be just a hologram, sir.
"
18,10,MJ's Hologram,"Naw, it's ignorant! You don't understand! We have to stop them! Heee hee!
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black??
"
18,10,Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing?!
"
18,10,Stan,"Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
"
18,10,Kyle,"They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
"
18,10,Stan,"Who did?
"
18,10,Kyle,"These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
"
18,10,Stan,"That's a little strange, isn't it?
"
18,10,Kyle,"No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
"
18,10,Announcer,"From the producers of Women Of Rock Live and The Rockefeller Tree Lighting Ceremony, it's the holiday television event of the season!

Watt  Miley Cyrus  U2  Angelina Jolie  Bill Cosby and Taylor Swift  A hologram of Elvis Presley  Kurt Cobain's hologram  The hologram of Robin Williams  Tom Hanks, Lorde  First Lady Michelle Obama  And Michael Jackson's hologram as Peter Pan.

18,10,MJ's hologram,"I'm flying! Hee dah dada dat dih
"
18,10,Announcer,"And featuring live commentary the entire show by CartmanBrah.
"
18,10,Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?
"
18,10,Announcer,"There's something for every generation to bring families together.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
"
18,10,Cartman,"He's such a douchebag.
"
18,10,Announcer,"It's all live and it's all magical. It's the Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special.
"
18,10,Cartman,"Now we're talkin'! 
"
18,10,Kyle,"That son of a bitch!
"
18,10,Stan,"That self-promoting asshole!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Why would he do this?!
"
18,10,Stan,"Because my dad's an idiot!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!
"
18,10,Stan,"Nnnothing, nothing.
"
18,10,Cartman,"Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. 
"
18,10,Exec. 1,"So far the holiday special is trending fine, but it appears that the Michael Jackson hologram is the most heavily tweeted.
"
18,10,Record Producer,"And we still have no idea where the damned hologram is?
"
18,10,Ron,"Not yet, but Tupac is close to hunting him down.
"
18,10,Cartman,"Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.
"
18,10,Record Producer,"We got one shot at this, people! This  has to be the holiday special to end all holiday specials!
"
18,10,Ron,"Sir, I get that you brought this YouTube commentator in because he's popular with the younger kids, but now he's trying to tell us what the show should be called??
"
18,10,Record Producer,"He's got his finger on the pulse of young America.
"
18,10,Exec. 2,"Sir, I'm pretty sure that  ""Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special"" is not a good name.
"
18,10,Cartman,"No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!
"
18,10,Ron,"If I may be frank, sir, I think you're giving this kid a little too much power!
"
18,10,Cartman,"I can hear you, douchebag.
"
18,10,Record Producer,"People, you know what we're trying to do here.  We're trying to finally create entertainment that reaches the younger generation, that unites the young with the old. That means being hip, being now.
"
18,10,Cartman,"These guys are such blumpkin catchers.
"
18,10,Record Producer,"There, you see that? ""Blumpkin catchers."" Do any of you even know what that means? This kid is our way to connect with the youth of America, and I'm gonna give him all the power he needs.
"
18,10,Cartman,"G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!
"
18,10,Officer 4,"What about this, sir? Burnt sienna?
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"He's not a Native American, damnit! That's obvious!
"
18,10,Officer 1,"I'll, I'll put it in the report he's Mylar brown.
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy!
"
18,10,Randy,"Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde.
"
18,10,MJ's hologram,"Who? Lorde? You're not Lorde, that's ignorant.
"
18,10,Randy,"Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
"
18,10,MJ's hologram,"They're gonna make a big holiday special. They've got holograms and YouTube commentators and live tweeting and it's ignorant! It's gonna be the most ignorant holiday special ever!
"
18,10,Randy,"A holiday special. Oh my God.
"
18,10,MJ's hologram,"It's directed at children! We have to stop them!
"
18,10,Officer 4,"Huh how about we say he's mixed race?
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay.
"
18,10,Randy,"I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special!  Can you help me stop them?!
"
18,10,MJ's hologram,"Yes. We have to reach the children. It's our only hope.
"
18,10,Randy,"Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.
"
18,10,MJ's hologram,"ALLEGEDLY!  THAT WAS A CIVIL SUIT AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE!  It's ignorant.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Mom?! Where is Ike?!
"
18,10,Sheila,"Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial.
"
18,10,Kyle,"That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
"
18,10,Sheila,"He's upstairs playing with all his friends.
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"Oh my God, that's the ugliest...
"
18,10,Kyle,"Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!
"
18,10,Kid 2,"Old people are so funny.
"
18,10,Conner,"They really just don't get it.
"
18,10,Kid 3,"And they smell like soap.
"
18,10,Stan,"We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
"
18,10,Kid 4,"Careful Grandpa, you might crap your Depends! 
"
18,10,Kyle,"WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!
"
18,10,Stan,"Yeah, you damn kids!
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"...that's the lamest...
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Okay, okay, so we're agreeing the hologram is black. So the question is, if he's black, then how come we couldn't choke him?
"
18,10,Front Desk Officer,"Can I help you?  Eh-excuse me. Can I help you?  Sir? A black guy walked into the police station!
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Heh, uh huh? 
"
18,10,Front Desk Officer,"Well a, a black guy walked into the police station.
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Yeah? Wait. Mitchell, listen to this one.  Start over: what's the setup?
"
18,10,Front Desk Officer,"There's this black guy, walked into the police station.
"
18,10,Mitchell,"Oh yeah, I think I've heard it, but go ahead.
"
18,10,Front Desk Officer,"No, really, a black guy walked into the-!
"
18,10,Mitchell,"Ohhh ya ya ya? ""We set who free?""
"
18,10,Front Desk Officer,"No no, a black guy literally walked into the police station!
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Oh, it's a new one.  Aw, shit! Look out! 
"
18,10,Officer 4,"It's a black guy! Choke him!
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Shoot him!
"
18,10,Officer 4,"Shoot him and then choke him! 
"
18,10,MJ's hologram,"He's here to kill us! Run!! Heee heee! 
"
18,10,Kyle,"Cartman, open this door right now!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!
"
18,10,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
18,10,Cartman,"What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
"
18,10,Cartman,"How do you even know I'm here in my room?
"
18,10,Kyle,"Because you just said, ""here in my room""!
"
18,10,Cartman,"...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions.  You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. 
"
18,10,Stan,"Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Why does that matter?
"
18,10,Stan,"Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!  Lorde is my dad.
"
18,10,Cartman,"What?
"
18,10,Kyle,"What are you talking about, Stan?
"
18,10,Stan,"He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
"
18,10,Cartman,"Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. 
"
18,10,Kyle,"Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.
"
18,10,Stan,"It just all seemed so... stupid.
"
18,10,Kyle,"I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
"
18,10,Sharon,"See if it started!
"
18,10,Randy,"We don't really use this thing anymore.  It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!
"
18,10,Sharon,"Randy, what about Shelley?
"
18,10,Randy,"Oh my God...
"
18,10,MJ's hologram,"Shelley? who's Shelley? That's ignorant.
"
18,10,Randy,"My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.
"
18,10,Sharon,"How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you?
"
18,10,Randy,"I guess... one step at a time.
"
18,10,Randy,"Shelley? Um, I'm Lorde.  All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. Whew, that was hard.
"
18,10,Sharon,RANDY?!
18,10,Sharon,"It's started.
"
18,10,Announcer,"And now, Nabisco and Dolly Madison present, The Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special! 
"
18,10,Announcer,"And now, live via hologram, it's Kurt Cobain. 
"
18,10,Cartman,"Oh, this should be good.
"
18,10,Kurt's hologram,"Up on the housetop, reindeer pawsOut jumps good ole Santa Claus
"
18,10,Cartman,"I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
"
18,10,Kurt's hologram,"Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, girls and boys 
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go
Yeh-he-he-eah who wouldn't go 
Up on the housetop clickity click click 
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick? 
"
18,10,Cartman,"Hoh, this should get some comments. 
"
18,10,Ron,"Stand by on camera 4. Boost the live Twitter feed. Aaand cue the hash tag! How are we trending?
"
18,10,Controller 1,"Trending at 64% and steady.
"
18,10,Ron,"We're trending at 64%, sir.
"
18,10,Record Producer,"Excellent. I'm just about to deal with our last order of business now.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
"
18,10,Record Producer,"No no, thank you!  If you hadn't called, I... wouldn't know what I know now. 
"
18,10,Stan,"Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
"
18,10,Record Producer,"It's me. I've got somethin' you might be interested in.
"
18,10,Randy,"I don't think so, you son of a bitch! 
"
18,10,Record Producer,"I've got your son here, Lorde. If you don't cooperate, he dies.
"
18,10,Stan,"What?? 
"
18,10,Randy,"Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS!
"
18,10,Sharon,"Randy, where are you going?!
"
18,10,Randy,"THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!  SHIT!! 
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"All right, listen up! We believe this is where the black people are! They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them, so stand by till we figure out what the hell to do!
"
18,10,Officer 5,"Sir! You'd better see this!  There's something new trending! #copscantgoaroundchokingblackpeople.
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"We know we can't, but we're trying to! Jesus, tell them we're workiing on it!
"
18,10,Officer 6,"No, sir, I I think they mean we shouldn't. Like we're racist or something.
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"What?! We're not racists.
"
18,10,Peterson,"Sir, we've got confirmation. There's two black guys in the upstairs of the house!
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Uh huh, go ahead.
"
18,10,Peterson,"Two black guys. One of them is threatening the other one.
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Yehah? Hang on! Mitch!  Two black guys in the upstairs of the house. One of them is threatening the other one.  Okay, go ahead.
"
18,10,Announcer,"And now, together at last, Iggy Azalea and Elvis. 
"
18,10,Cartman,"Oh bros, weak!
"
18,10,Elvis' Hologram,"Have a jolly holly Christmas
"
18,10,Iggy's Ass,"It's the best time of the pfffffffft.
"
18,10,Elvis' Hologram,"I don't know if there'll be snow
but have a cup of
"
18,10,Iggy's Ass,"Pfffffffft
"
18,10,Cartman,"Oh weak, bros, so weak!
"
18,10,Controller 2,"It's incredible! I've never seen trending like this!
"
18,10,Ron,"We're trending well?
"
18,10,Controller 1,"We're barely trending at all. But #ihatecartmanbrah is trending off the charts!
"
18,10,Controller 2,"He's right. ihatecartmanbrah is trending at 96% and climbing.
"
18,10,Ron,"That's impossible.
"
18,10,Kyle,"How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
"
18,10,Record Producer,"It was five years ago that I... became a grandpa. At first it was wonderful. I wanted to show my grandson everything. Teach him all about the entertainment business. One day I aasked him, ""Who's your favorite celebrity?"" You know what he said to me? He said, ""PeewwDiePie."" I had no idea who  he was talking about. So I looked it up. And he was this insignificant little game blogger from Sweden who my grandson thought was a god! No matter who else I tried to impress him with, he would just say, ""Meh."" To me! MEH!  What the hell is wrong with these kids today?? With this special, we will assimilate this generation's culture into ours! MAKE THEM APPRECIATE REAL ENTERTAINMENT, DAMNIT! 
"
18,10,Stan,"Dude. You're such a grandpa.
"
18,10,Record Producer,"I AM NOT A GRANDPAAA!
"
18,10,Taylor,"Well I guess it's time to leave.
"
18,10,Bill's hologram,"Oh but it's snowin' out dere.
"
18,10,Taylor,"Yeah but I need to get home.
"
18,10,Bill's hologram,"But it's snowin' out dere.
"
18,10,Taylor,"I really should go
"
18,10,Bill's hologram,"Oh what's the hurry?
"
18,10,Taylor,"Say, what's in this drink?
"
18,10,Bill's hologram,"That's just some J-E-L-L-O.
"
18,10,Taylor,"The holidays are comin'-
"
18,10,Dad,"This is the oddest holiday special I've ever seen.
"
18,10,Mom,"Maybe we should turn it off.
"
18,10,Cartman,"Oh wow, where are we now, brahs?  This looks pretty stupid.
"
18,10,Dad,"What the heck? 
"
18,10,Cartman,"CartmaanBrah!
"
18,10,Dad,"This damn TV! What is that window doing outside the holiday special?! 
"
18,10,Mom,"Call customer service.
"
18,10,Steve,"Panasonic customer service. How can I help you?
"
18,10,Dad,"Yeah, we've got a commenter window in our living room. How do I get rid of that?
"
18,10,Steve,"Ohhhh yes yes yes yes. Many people are calling about this. We have NO idea what's going on. Have I answered all your questions in a timely manner?
"
18,10,Cartman,"Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!
"
18,10,Ron,"This isn't part of the holiday special! What is he doing?!
"
18,10,Controller 2,"He's trending more than we ever thought possible.!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful.
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Okay! Okay, okay okay okay. Go ahead.
"
18,10,Peterson,"So, then, the first black guy said to the second black guy, ""Don't shoot me. I'm on your side.""
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Okay! Okay. Okay. Hold on.  Okay, go ahead.
"
18,10,Peterson,"And then the, the the tattooed black guy said, to him, ""I ain't gonna kill you, man. You're the King of Pop. Let's go cap that whitey producer.""
"
18,10,Det. Harris,"Oh God! Stop! Stop! Stop!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Happy holidays, everyone!  Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.
"
18,10,Record Producer,"Damn it, you're ruining the show!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.
"
18,10,Kyle,"I am so confused.
"
18,10,Record Producer,"Shut him down!'
"
18,10,Ron,"We can't, sir!
"
18,10,Cartman,"I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool.
"
18,10,Stephen,"I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it?
"
18,10,Cartman,"It's all CartmanBrah now.  I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender.  Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!
"
18,10,Record Producer,"This is not what I hired you for! I CONTROL TALENT, DAMNIT!
"
18,10,MJ's hologram,"There he is! That's the ignorant man!
"
18,10,Record Producer,"This is crazy and everyone is watching everything!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.
"
18,10,Kid 4,"Oh, I feel bad for the little guy.
"
18,10,Conner,"There's nothing sadder than a old man crying.
"
18,10,Kid 3,"Maybe we should help
"
18,10,Ike,"Yeah!
"
18,10,Kid 2,"Okay.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Help? How can you help?
"
18,10,Kid 2,"It's the holiday season. We just need to get everyone to believe again.
"
18,10,Conner,"Yeah, someone can come change all this. You know who.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Really? That's what you guys would do?
"
18,10,Conner,"Of course! We just need to get everyone to believe in him. He'll always come and help. #webelieveinyou
"
18,10,Kyle,"Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!
"
18,10,MJ's hologram,"We believe in you. Of course!
"
18,10,Kyle,"You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! 
"
18,10,Cartman,"Hey! What's going on? What is that? 
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"How's it goin' bros? This is PewDiePie!
"
18,10,Cartman,"What the hell?!
"
18,10,Kids,"PewDiePie!
"
18,10,Kyle,"PewDiePie?!
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"Thanks for all the shoutouts. I guess there's some little fat kid trying to be me, so let's check it out.
"
18,10,Cartman,"Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"God damn it, get out of here!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"This show is getting kind of boring, bros. What do you say we change it out to something more exciting?
"
18,10,Cartman,"Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"I know! Let's play Call of Duty! 
"
18,10,Cartman,"No! You can't do this!
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"Ohhh yeah! This is more like it, bros!
"
18,10,Cartman,"God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"Okay, that little fat kid is getting annoying. Let's get rid of him!
"
18,10,Cartman,"NOOOO! 
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"Oh yeah! Way better, bros! This is how we do it in Sweden! BOOM head shot! BOOM head shot!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.
"
18,10,Stan,"I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
"
18,10,Stan,"Yeah.
"
18,10,Kyle,"No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great.
"
18,10,Stan,"Yeah, I think that's great too.
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"Alright bros, it look like we'll have to end it there. I wanna thank South Park for being in my show. I hope you bros enjoyed watching, and as always, stay awesome!
"
18,10,PewDiePie,"Oh! That's it bros. Show's over.
"
