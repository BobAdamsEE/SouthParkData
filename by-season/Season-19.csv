19,1,Mr. Mackey,"Alright parents and students, please take your seats.  Okay, okay. Now as you know, There was an incident at the school last week involving a student referring to rape as a ""hot Cosby,"" okay?  Listen, listen! Principal Victoria has been fired!
"
19,1,Various adults,"What? Fired?
"
19,1,Cartman,"Sweet dude!
"
19,1,Mr. Mackey,"And a new person has been appointed to try and make South Park Elementary a amore... progressive place that... fits in with today's times. Heh ukay? So please welcome... PC Principal. 
"
19,1,PC Principal,"All right, listen up. My name is PC Principal. I don't know about you, but frankly I'm sick and tired of how minority groups are marginalized in today's society. I'm here because this place is lost in a time warp! Students who still use the word ""retarded""! A teacher who said women without wombs should get an AIDS test!
"
19,1,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, I was a  lesbian then.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"A chef ""person of color"" who the children had sing soul songs and who the children drove to kill himself!
"
19,1,Butters,"No, he got brainwashed by a cult.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"And that's two days' detention for you, young man! We'll see you at 4!
"
19,1,Butters,"What??
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Let me ask you this. We're in Colorado, right?! Where are the Hispanic kids?! Huh?! Where are the ethnic and racial minorities?!
"
19,1,Mr. Mackey,"Well, we have Token; he's black.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"And that's two days' detention for you, Mackey! Congratulations!
"
19,1,Mr. Mackey,"Wha- I got detention?
"
19,1,PC Principal,"I Googled South Park before I came here, and I cannot believe the shit you're getting away with! People claiming to be advocates of transgender rights, but really just wanting to use the women's bathroom!  A white man who thinks he's Chinese and built a wall to keep out Mongolians
"
19,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Ohhhh I hate-a Mongorians!
"
19,1,PC Principal,"What the fuck is this?! Are you fucking kidding me?! I'm telling you all, this is done! Like it or not, PC is back, and it's bigger than ever! Woowoowoo You hear that?! That's the sound of 2015 pulling you over, people! Suck it! 
"
19,1,Stan,"Man, I guess things are going to be different around here.
"
19,1,Kyle,"You know what? I think it's good. Let's face it: this is long overdue.
"
19,1,Butters,"Did you guys hear? Cartman got four days' suspension, for calling Heidi Turner ""clitty litter""!
"
19,1,Kenny,"(Really?)
"
19,1,Butters,"But the thing is, Eric isn't even fightin' it. It's like he's all sad and scared.
"
19,1,Kyle,"Good! He should be sad and scared! These things do matter And I already feel better to be at a school where we can start to have a dialogue and talk about this stuff.
"
19,1,Mr. Mackey,"Will uh, Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office immediately? Uhkay? Kyle Broflovski.  Did I, did I say that all right?
"
19,1,Gerald,"Uhm, hi, I'm Gerald, Kyle Broflovski's father.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Have a seat. I've been talking with your child, and we're gonna be giving him two weeks' detention.
"
19,1,Gerald,"Wull, what's this about, Kyle?
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Your son said some things to a fourth-grade girl that frankly make me wanna puke! Now that I'm principal, I'm not gonna allow  anyone at this school to be made feel unsafe and harassed!
"
19,1,Gerald,"Wh-wh-what did he say?
"
19,1,PC Principal,"You'll have toe excuse my language.  ""I don't think Caitlyn Jenner is a hero.""  This kind of transphobic and  bigoted hate speech isn't gonna fly here, bro! Well I though we were all on board that Caitlyn Jenner is an amazing,  beautiful woman who had the exquisite bravery of a butterfly flying against the wind. And then this shit comes out of people's mouths!
"
19,1,Gerald,"PC Principal, I, I'm sure Kyle was just referring to Bruce Jenner as a person, and not trying to say anything against-
"
19,1,PC Principal,"You got a fuckin' problem bro?!
"
19,1,Gerald,"No...
"
19,1,PC Principal,"'Cause it's not Bruce fuckin' Jenner! It's Caitlyn, and she's a fuckin' stunning woman! Or maybe you're the one teaching him to demean women in the first place! HUH?! What's up?! What's fuckin' up, bro?
"
19,1,Gerald,"Look, maybe we can all just ta-
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Get the fuck out of here, dude! 
"
19,1,Gerald and Kyle,"Aaah! 
"
19,1,Randy,"I mean, who the hell does this guy think he is? Some college kid's gonna come in and tell us our ways are old?
"
19,1,Stuart,"Yeah. And, you can't bully our kids like that.
"
19,1,Gerald,"Kyle's already got two weeks of detention.
"
19,1,Stephen,"Huh for what?!
"
19,1,Gerald,"Just 'cause he said something about Caitlyn Jenner. 
"
19,1,Stephen,"Oh, Caitlyn Jenner. she's a hero. She is stunning and brave.
"
19,1,Stuart,"Stunning. She is absolutely beautiful, and an inspiration.
"
19,1,Ryan,"Yup!
"
19,1,Randy,"Yup, that's right.
"
19,1,Gerald,"Well what the hell were you guys talki-
"
19,1,Ryan,"we've gotta be careful, Gerald. This is a college bar.
"
19,1,PC Bro 1,"Somebody here have a problem with Caitlyn Jenner?
"
19,1,Ryan,"No.
"
19,1,PC Bro 1,"No? 'Cause she's a stunning, beautiful woman, and if you wanna call her anything else I'm ready to fuckin' throw down!
"
19,1,Stuart,"No no, we're totally fine with it.
"
19,1,PC Bro 2,"Woowoowoowoowoo!  It? Did somebody just refer to Caitlyn Jenner as ""it""? I'm PC, bro. I'll throw down!
"
19,1,PC Bro 1,"Sweet. You're PC bro?
"
19,1,PC Bro 2,"Yeah, Arizona State.
"
19,1,PC Bro 1,"Sweet, bro. I'm PC UMass.
"
19,1,PC Bro 2,"Fuck yeah! Sweet, dude! 
"
19,1,PC Bro 1,"Sweet!  So, do we have a fuckin' problem here?
"
19,1,Stephen,"No! Caitlyn Jenner is the bravest woman in America.
"
19,1,PC Bro 3,"Woo-oowoo-oowoo-oo!  Did someone here just say ""America"" in a way that ""otherwise"" and demeans the people of Latin and South America?!
"
19,1,PC Bro 2,"Nice, dude. You PC?
"
19,1,PC Bro 3,"Yeah, Chino Hills.  You think Venezuelans aren't Americans, brah?!
"
19,1,PC Bro 2,"Yeah, you wanna make fun of me?!
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Hey! What seems to be the problem here, gentlemen?!
"
19,1,PC Bro 1,"Who the hell are you?!
"
19,1,PC Principal,"I'm PC Principal.
"
19,1,PC Bro 2,"Oh nice. We're all PC too.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"No way! There's more PC bros here?
"
19,1,PC Bro 4,"Yeah dude, Ohio State.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Sweet, bro. Texas A&M. Bro, I had no idea there were like-minded individuals in this town that defended social minorities. We should all hang out.
"
19,1,PC Bro 1,"We should totally hang out.
"
19,1,PC Bro 4,"We should all get a house together and unite our tolerant views.
"
19,1,PC Bro 1,"Fuckin' do it, dude!
"
19,1,PC Bro 4,"Fuck yeah!
"
19,1,Janitor,"Well, looks like thangs are gettin' all PC again. 
"
19,1,Friend,"Well how long d'you think this will last?
"
19,1,Janitor,"Lasted about six years last time. We got at least  5.9 years to go.
"
19,1,Kyle,"Uhhh, hey Cartman. Uhwaht's goin' on? Aren't you going to ah, you know, go do something about this new principal?
"
19,1,Cartman,"I've already got four days of detention. I don't want anymore. I'm gonna start following the rules.
"
19,1,Stan,"But, this isn't you, Cartman.
"
19,1,Kyle,"Yeah, where is the Eric Cartman we know? The Eric Cartman we know breaks the rules. And he gets away with it. Just like his hero! Come on, who's your hero, Cartman?!
"
19,1,Cartman,"Tom Brady.
"
19,1,Stan,"Right! And what does Tom Brady do after breaking the rules?
"
19,1,Cartman,"Deny and subvert.
"
19,1,Stan,"Yeah!
"
19,1,Butters,"Yeah, what? Well what would Tom Brady say if he got caught shoplifting.
"
19,1,Cartman,"Everybody shoplifts. Why are you coming down on me? Kyle, Stan...
"
19,1,Butters,"Yeah!
"
19,1,Kyle,"You're Tom Brady, Cartman! And that new principal in there is the football commissioner trying to dictate his punishment to you. And what happens when an invulnerable cheater comes up against an elitist corporate dictator?
"
19,1,Cartman,"A perfect storm of hypocrisy that everyone in the country has to deal with for months on end.
"
19,1,Cartman,"You're right, guys. I'm gonna Tom Brady this thing!
Boys:	Yeah!
"
19,1,Cartman,"I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say ""You're not giving me four day of detention! You're only giving me one!""
"
19,1,Boys,"Yeah!
"
19,1,Cartman,"NO! No, to hell with that! ""You're giving me NO days suspension! And then I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife! Who's not even that hot, and kinda looks like a dude!"" 
"
19,1,Boys,"Yeah!
"
19,1,Cartman,"Thanks, guys. I almost forgot the lessons that football has taught us all. I can get around these pesky rules. Butters, I'm going to need your underwear. 
"
19,1,Butters,"Well ohhh-kay! 
"
19,1,Kyle,"Cool. I think we did it. 
"
19,1,Cartman,"Oh, PC Principal, how are you today?
"
19,1,PC Principal,"What are you doing in the faculty bathroom?
"
19,1,Cartman,"You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I'm not going to accept four days of detention and... you're going t'apologize publicly for being so strict to me and my friends at school.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"What the fuck are you talking about?
"
19,1,Cartman,"It's just a request, that's all. See you around.  Oh, you seem to have dropped something, PC Principal.  What's this? Why, this is a little boy's underwear.  Why, this is Butters' underwear.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"What?
"
19,1,Cartman,"PC Principal, you have Butters' underwear and now...  Oh my gosh, it's got your DNA all over it.  This certainly doesn't look good for you. I don't need to tell anyone about this. No, I think we have an understanding. Capisce?
"
19,1,PC Principal,"What did you just say?
"
19,1,Cartman,"You mean about keeping your dick out?
"
19,1,PC Principal,"""Capisce""?! You're associating Italian-Americans to intimidation tactics?!  You'd better watch your micro-aggression's, bro! 
"
19,1,Cartman,"Oh-kay. Look, you don't want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so you?
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Did you just use a term that excludes women from an occupation?! 
"
19,1,Cartman,"Okay, let's back up.  Aaah!
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Did you just say ""spokesman"" instead of ""spokesperson""?! When women are just as capable at selling sandwiches as anyone?!  Are you purposely trying to use words that assert your male privilege?! 
"
19,1,Cartman,"No, I'm sorry. I was just trying to frame you for raping Butters!
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Do you think Italian-Americans and women are less important?! 
"
19,1,Cartman,"Oh God!
"
19,1,PC Principal,"You dare use words that alienate two communities of people who have to deal with biases like yours on a daily basis?! 
"
19,1,Randy,"Can I speak with PC Principal please?
"
19,1,PC Bro 5,"Oh yeah. We got another one, guys!
"
19,1,PC Bro 6,"All right. Bring him in, bro!
"
19,1,PC Bro 7,"We're ready! Woo! 
"
19,1,Randy,"Hey what?  Hey no, I- No, I don't- 
"
19,1,PC Bro 8,"All the pledges take a shot! 
"
19,1,PC Principal,"All right pledges, we're excited. You wanna try and be PC. We hope you've got what it takes to join the most socially active group in America.
"
19,1,PC Bros,"Wooo!
"
19,1,PC Principal,"You know, there's still some people out there that say ""What does being PC really mean?"" Well, I'll tell you what it means. It means you love nothin' more than beer, workin' out, and that feelin' you get when you rhetorically defend a marginalized community from systems of oppression.
"
19,1,PC Bros,"Wooo! Yeah! Dude, let's go! Woowooo! Yeah!
"
19,1,Randy,"Yeah!
"
19,1,PC Bros,"Wooohooo!
"
19,1,Randy,"Wooo-ooo!
"
19,1,PC Bros,"Wooohooo! let's go! Yeah!
"
19,1,Sharon,"You got home pretty late last night. Six AM?
"
19,1,Randy,"I've joined a social awareness group. It's a coalition that discourages the use of ... words that have negative or offensive connotations... to grant respect to people who are victims of unfair stereotypes.
"
19,1,Sharon,"You got in at Six and now you're missing work.
"
19,1,Randy,"We've been getting away with horrible things, Sharon. Having- laughs at less privileged people and thinking it was harmless. Our group is... trying to be a civilizing influence... where we discuss and have meetings to better define and reinforce tolerance and acceptance  of all groups of people.
"
19,1,Sharon,"Hm... And do they have booze at these meetings?
"
19,1,Randy,"Uhhhh... They serve refreshments, yes.
"
19,1,Stan,"Cartman?
"
19,1,Cartman,"We can't beat him, you guys. PC Principal is too strong.
"
19,1,Butters,"What do we do now?
"
19,1,Cartman,"There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admit I did something wrong, take my punishment, and move on. I'm not Tom Brady.
"
19,1,Butters,"Oh no!
"
19,1,Kyle,"Dude, if we all tell the police what the principal did, he'll be fired!
"
19,1,Stan,"Yeah.
"
19,1,Cartman,"No way.
"
19,1,Kyle,"Why?
"
19,1,Cartman,"Because PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it's time for us to grow up.
"
19,1,Kyle,"No, you're a bigot.
"
19,1,Cartman,"If I can face my prejudice, why can't you? We're two privileged, straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with.
"
19,1,Kyle,"I'm not going to apologize for saying Caitlyn Jenner isn't a hero! In fact, personally, I think she's most likely not a very good person! 
"
19,1,Cartman,"Aaahh, aahh!  Kyle, believe me! I know the struggle with hatred. Let's make ourselves better people... together. 
"
19,1,Kyle,"Come on, fatass.
"
19,1,Cartman,"No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let's start a new chapter.
"
19,1,Kyle,"So you're never gonna call me a dirty Jew again?
"
19,1,Cartman,"No. I'm going to call you... my friend.
"
19,1,Kyle,"Oh fuck you. 
"
19,1,Cartman,"I... guess we never realized how bad he really was.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"All right, pledges, listen up. Congratulations on making it to the final cuts. 
"
19,1,Pledges,"Wooohoo! Yeah!
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Now it's time for the final test. So what you're gonna have to do to prove you belong with PC, is just go out there, and check someone's privilege.
"
19,1,Pledge 1,"Finally!
"
19,1,Pledge 2,"Yes!
"
19,1,Randy,"I'm sorry, I don't know what that is.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Topher, can you explain ""check your privilege"" please.
"
19,1,Topher,"Uh, that's getting someone to acknowledge their own inherent privileges and reminding them to put them aside in order to better understand another human's plight.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"Yeah, see, there's some people out there like Brett fucking Favre who think that when we all stand up and applaud Caitlyn Jenner at the ESPY Awards, he can get away with one of these bullshit claps!  It's called ""clapping"" Favre! What the fuck are you doing?! Washing your hands?! You're either on board, or you're NOT, bro! Now, if he's gonna bring shame on someone, then he can have his privilege checked and have a little shame brought down on him!
"
19,1,Randy,"You want me to shame Brett Favre?
"
19,1,PC Principal,"No. 'Cause there's somebody even worse now.
"
19,1,Kyle,"AAAAHH! What the fuck, dude?! What the fuck?! 
"
19,1,Cartman Brady,"I may be down, but I'm not out. Tom Brady's never out!
"
19,1,Commissioner Cartman,"You broke the rules!
"
19,1,Cartman Brady,"Fuck you, ""I broke the rules""! YOU're breaking the rules!
"
19,1,Commissioner Cartman,"Fuck you, you broke the rules!
"
19,1,Cartman Brady,"You broke the rules, how you found out I broke the rules!
"
19,1,Coach Cartman,"Yeah, you broke the rules!
"
19,1,Commissioner Cartman,"I'm the commissioner! I can break the rules 'cause you guys broke the rules before! I didn't bust you enough!
"
19,1,"Coach, Brady","Just because you didn't bust us enough for breakin' the rules, that doesn't mean you can break the rules bustin' us now!
"
19,1,Commissioner Cartman,"Fuck both you guys! I can do whatever I want! I'm breakin' the rules!
"
19,1,Cartman Brady,"Fuck you, I'm Tom Brady!
"
19,1,Commissioner Cartman,"Fuck you, I'm the commissioner! I'll make up new rules!
"
19,1,"Coach, Brady","Fuck your rules!
"
19,1,Commissioner Cartman,"Fuck you guys, always fucking rules!
"
19,1,Cartman Brady,"Fuck all the rules! 
"
19,1,Cartman,"Ack! Butters!
"
19,1,Butters,"I'm here, Eric.
"
19,1,Cartman,"Oh Butters, I've lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS?
"
19,1,Butters,"Yes Eric.
"
19,1,Cartman,"I'm never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman.
"
19,1,Kyle,"Will you please tell your dad to leave me alone?
"
19,1,Stan,"Dude, what happened?
"
19,1,Kyle,"Your dad was on my lawn yelling at me all night, and after I finally fell asleep I woke up Saran-wrapped to a tree with penises on my face. And this. 
"
19,1,Stan,"Hang on.  Dad, did you draw dicks on my friend's face?
"
19,1,Randy,"Did I check his privilege? Yes. I had some refreshments and I checked your friend's privilege.
"
19,1,Stan,"That's my best friend, Dad! Stop shaming him because you want to fit in!
"
19,1,Randy,"Stan, straight white males in a capitalistic society have little- understanding of victimization compared to injustices against the underprivileged. Dicks on your face is a very first-world problem.  Oh shit! 
"
19,1,Stan,"Look, Kyle, maybe you should just say Caitlyn Jenner is a hero.
"
19,1,Kyle,"I didn't even say she wasn't a hero! I just said she isn't a hero to me! I didn't like Bruce Jenner as a person when he was on the Kardashians, and I don't suddenly like him now!
"
19,1,A passing bro,"Woowoowoowoo!
"
19,1,Stan,"Her.
"
19,1,Kyle,"HER, yes!
"
19,1,Cartman,"OH. Eh, oh it's no use, Butters. I want to get out there and start making positive changes, but I... can barely even walk.  How is everybody doing?
"
19,1,Butters,"Well they're fine. Everyone's just kind of keepin' their mouths shut. It's kinda nice.  So the PC guys are leavin' people alone. Well, except for...
"
19,1,Cartman,"Who?
"
19,1,Butters,"Well, well now they've made Kyle their main target.
"
19,1,Cartman,"...Kyle? ...My friend Kyle? 
"
19,1,Butters,"Eric, what are you doing?
"
19,1,Cartman,"I don't have a choice. I have to take these PC people out.
"
19,1,Butters,"Oh, but I thought you agreed with them.
"
19,1,Cartman,"I do, but I have to help Kyle, even if I don't agree with his hateful, bigoted thoughts. Kyle's view may be warped. I personally think Caitlyn Jenner's a stunning hero,  but that doesn't mean I'll stand by while Kyle's intolerance is dealt with violently. We're going to war with these PC people once and for all! Butters, I'm going to need 200 pregnant Mexican women and some taco launchers.
"
19,1,Butters,"Well ohhh-kay!
"
19,1,PC Bros,"Social Justice 1 2 3 Woowoo!
I wanna be PC Woowoo!
It's just the way to be for me!
And you!
Woowoo!
Your hateful slurs are though! Woowoo!
"
19,1,PC Bro 9,"I call woowoo on you!
"
19,1,PC Bros,"Woowoo! We'll fight until you're PC black and blue!
"
19,1,Randy,"Woowoo!
"
19,1,PC Bros,"We are language police fighting bigotry!
Hurtful words can suck our turds, 'cause it's PC for me!
"
19,1,PC Bro 5,"And you!
"
19,1,PC Bros,"Woowoo! Yeah! Yeah! Fuck yeah!
"
19,1,PC Bro 5,"Fuck yeah, bro! PC bro! 
"
19,1,Cartman,"All right, send in the pregnant Mexican women! 
Pregnant Mexican Women:	Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
"
19,1,PC Bro 5,"Fuck, bro?! 
"
19,1,Cartman,"Fire the taco launchers!  Syrian refugee children, flank from the left! 
"
19,1,PC Bro 2,"Dude, what is this, bro?!
"
19,1,PC Bro 6,"I don't know, bro!
"
19,1,Cartman,"The Syrian refugee children are in; send in Jared! 
"
19,1,Stephen,"What in the world is going on??
"
19,1,Cartman,"All right, good. The pregnant Mexican women are falling asleep on the tacos.  All right, the Syrian refugees are trying to protect their children! 
"
19,1,A PC Bro,"Ohhh! 
"
19,1,Cartman,"There's still too many PC guys on the balcony and- oh.  Oh fuck, there's Kyle.  What the fuck are you doing, Kyle?
"
19,1,Kyle,"Enough! Stop! Everyone STOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHP!  This is so wrong! I can't let it continue! This is not ever what I intended! I just want to say... Caitlyn Jenner is a hero. There's no other way to say it. What she did took bravery, and she is absolutely stunning. 
"
19,1,Townsman,"Wooo.
"
19,1,Randy,"Ow, hot. Hot hot, hothohhht.  Ahhh.
"
19,1,PC Principal,"I gotta hand it to you, Marsh. You really checked that little boy's privilege. Using those Syrian refugees was genius, bro.
"
19,1,PC Bro 4,"Yeah. I would have never thought to use offensive imagery and outrageous stereotypes to provoke someone to open their eyes.
"
19,1,Randy,"So I'm PC now?
"
19,1,PC Principal,"You're not only PC, you've actually changed my PC.  Congrats. Here's your Oakleys.
"
19,1,Randy,"Oh wow. Oakleys!  Oh yeah bro, these are sweet.
"
19,1,Stan,"So I guess PC Principal is here to stay, huh?
"
19,1,Cartman,"Yes. But at least we him that sometimes joking about un-PC things can actually be important, because it starts a dialogue.  What's wrong, Kyle? You have your cake. Eat it, too.
"
19,1,Stan,"It just seems to me like we all lost in this, and that the only person who won was you.
"
19,1,Cartman,"Hmmm... And who does that remind you of, Kyle? Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife. Who, kind of looks like, a dude.
"
19,2,President Obama,"Now, last week we were all reminded that intolerance still exists in our country. It took a very special young student to light up social media, and we've invited him to the White House today to show our appreciation. Because never have there been more tolerant, more moving words than Kyle Broflovski's speech about his hero Caitlyn Jenner.  Come on up here, Kyle.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"You see?? There! This is why it's happeming! Everyone's preachin' openness and acceptance, and so now millions of goddamned immigrants are comin' over the border and nobody seems to care!
"
19,2,Mr. Adler,"Well what are you gonna do? In today's world it's like you can't even say anything negative about illegal immigrants.
"
19,2,Randy,"Woo woo woo woo woo! Did somebody oer here say ""illegal immigrants""? Because the correct term is ""undocumented immigrants,"" alright bro? 
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"It's like nobody cares! And they just keep comin'1 Crossin' the border with their dirty families, playin' their stupid music!  I mean, look at 'em! I'll bet noe ONE of them is here legally! 
"
19,2,Canadian 1,"Alright guy!
"
19,2,Canadian 2,"Hey buddih!
"
19,2,Canadian 3,"Hey buddih!
"
19,2,Canadian 4,"Hey, what's going on fwiend!
"
19,2,Canadian 5,"Hey, buddih! Another Moosehead, eh?
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"We should have put up a goddamned wall. 
"
19,2,President Obama,"But wait, there's still more,  because this country was built on dreamers, and Kyle, we want to make your dreams come true. And so here is your hero, Caitlyn Jenner. 
"
19,2,Caitlyn Jenner,"I just wanna say thank you Kyle for your beautiful words of support.
"
19,2,President Obama,"Now Kyle, we've got another little surprise for you. We told you we were flying you back home, but the truth is, you're getting a ride back all the way with your hero! How do you like that?! 
"
19,2,Caitlyn Jenner,"Buckle up, buckaroo! 
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. As you've probably noticed, our government has decided to let anyone who wants to cross the border and screw up our country!  I know you're all as pissed off as I am, so why don't we begin today's lesson on why the once-great empire of Rome, fell to shit! Huh?! Who can tell my why Rome fell to shit?!  No, somebody who matters!  Alright, fine, in the orange shirt.
"
19,2,Canadian Kid 1,"The Roman Empire, buddy, was facing ehh several issues, guy, and they reached a new millennium, friend, and rather-
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, speak in English! You see,  what happened is that these immigrants called Goths  were welcomed into Roman territories  because some people felt bad for them.  And then the Goths suddenly decided they were being oppressed, you see, and so then-  What the hell are you doing?! 
"
19,2,Canadian Kid 2,"It's 8 am, guy.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Well that's it! Why don't you Canucks go back where you came from?! 
"
19,2,PC Principal,"You really think you can refer to an undocumented immigrant as a ""Canuck""?!
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"PC Principal, they got up in the middle of my lecture and started playing music!
"
19,2,PC Principal,"So did you forget that at eight and eleven all Canadians face east and play Chuck Mangione?  Or did you not care to find out about their religious customs.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Thuh, they don't even speak English!
"
19,2,PC Principal,"Then you need to be teaching in both languages from now on! Mackey, sign the faculty up for Canadian-language night classes!
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"What?!
"
19,2,Mr. Mackey,"Yes, PC Principal! R-right away! M'kay?
"
19,2,PC Principal,"You're on thin ice, Garrison! Get in line or you'll be out of a job, bro!
"
19,2,Stan,"What are they doing now? 
"
19,2,Butters,"Well they're all eatin' together and praying. A-and they're puttin' syrup on their Mac & Cheese! 
"
19,2,Clyde,"Ugh, so weird!
"
19,2,Token,"There's just so many of them.
"
19,2,Cartman,"You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy.
"
19,2,Token,"Whattaya mean?
"
19,2,Cartman,"Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in?
"
19,2,Kyle,"I'm sitting right here.
"
19,2,Cartman,"And he's sitting right here.
"
19,2,Kyle,"You really think just my speech brought on a wave of illegal immigration?!
"
19,2,Stan,"You did kind of go overboard, dude.
"
19,2,Kyle,"What??
"
19,2,Stan,"It's just... I know you like giving speeches and stuff, but not everything is black and white.
"
19,2,Clyde,"Yeah, I mean, it's fine you wanna go preach about Caitlyn Jenner, but you can't just make blanket statements about letting anyone do whatever they want.
"
19,2,Kyle,"I didn't even wanna give that speech!
"
19,2,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, this is interesting. Have you guys read Genesis Thirty-four?
"
19,2,Butters,"Uh uh.
"
19,2,Cartman,"Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now.
"
19,2,Kyle,"Uh I'm not responsible for this! Illegal immigration has been happening forever.
"
19,2,Cartman,"But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew.
"
19,2,Kyle,"You guys, immigration either legal or illegal are always gonna find ways to cross into richer countries if they're not living-
"
19,2,Stan,"Oh boy, here we go again. 
"
19,2,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm out.
"
19,2,Butters,"Yeah, sorry. I can't listen to another one either. 
"
19,2,Mr. Stkrdknmibalz,"Happy evening, friends. My name is Mr. Stkrdknmibalz, and we are going to learn Canadian.
With a lot of practice, you're going to find that speaking Canadian isn't so difficult. And in fact, our alphabet and yours are fairly similar. So why don't we begin singing it together?

"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Where has my country gone?
Where has my country gone?
It was a land of opportunity that we held dear
But now all these other assholes are comin' here.
And where's my country gone?
It was just here like, two seconds ago.
'Cause when they said that this was the land of the free
I'm pretty sure that they were referring to me
And my country's gone!
It got upset and now it's wandered away
It took 43 Presidents to make us stand tall
And just one black guy to unravel it all
Country gone!
Please tell it that we need her back home.
There's a great big hole in the liberty bucket
'Cause someone forgot to tell the foreigners to suck it!
And now they're all hanging out on my lawn... 
And now they're ruining my song
Makin' it sound like Chuck Mangione 
Where has my country gone?
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Seems like everyone's afraid to speak the truth around here! Well I'm throwin' my hat in and sayin' I'll figure this thing out! Now I might not understand politics, or immigration policies, or... the law. Or basic... ideological... concepts. But dammit I understand there there's a bunch of Canadians here and I'm gonna do somethin' about it! 
"
19,2,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. In order for better understanding we've asked students of Canadian origin to introduce you to their culture and  HEY LESLIE! SHUT YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH!  - to introduce you to their culture and customs. So let's give them our undivided attention as they take us on a whirlwind journey through their diverse history.
"
19,2,Three students,"We are the Hopewell and Abenaki, first settlers of Canadian soil.
"
19,2,Kindergartner,"Guy.
"
19,2,Five students,"We are French and British explorers, seeking furs and goods. 
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, and I'm Dan Rather, and I got news for you! Nobody wants you here!  Sorry not sorry! It's time for someone to say it like it is, and make our country great again!
"
19,2,PC Principal,"Garrison, what do you think you're-?
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"And I'm also not afraid to stand up to PC Principal! You, sir, have a pizza face and you suck your mom's dick!
"
19,2,PC Principal,"That's it Garrison! You are fired from South Park Elementary!
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, see? And now I'm fired! That's the cold, hard truth of immigration! Well there's only one immigration policy that I believe in, and that's fuckin' them all to death!  I'm just sayin' what everyone here's thinkin', kids! Sorry not sorry!
"
19,2,Stan,"Dude, the Canadians are pissed off.
"
19,2,Token,"Can you really blame them?
"
19,2,Butters,"What made Mr. Garrison do that?
"
19,2,Cartman,"Guys, what if this was all exactly what Kyle planned? Get the Canadians here, make them feel persecuted, and then what? Uprisings? Rebellion? Next thing you know, they're sending us to camps and using us as livestock!
"
19,2,Butters,"You really think Kyle would do that?
"
19,2,Stan,"That doesn't matter. We have to think of a way to smooth this over, fast.
"
19,2,Cartman,"Yeah, we're gonna need a symbolic union.
"
19,2,Token,"A what?
"
19,2,Cartman,"You know, what's that story about two sides that were fighting and, then a guy from one side got with a girl from the other side and their love sort of brought the groups together?
"
19,2,Butters,"Lion King two?
"
19,2,Cartman,"Yes, Lion King II?. I mean, if we can get one of us to go out with one of them - probably, have sex - then it could be a symbol of us all getting along.
"
19,2,Craig,"Yeah, kind of like when the princess of one country marries the prince of another.
"
19,2,Kyle,"Oh, come on, this is stupid. You guys, when two groups of people don't understand each other you can't just try and diffuse the tension with-
"
19,2,Cartman,"Is he seriously? Is he seriously giving a speech right now?  Is he SERIOUSLY giving a speech right now?!  This is gonna have to happen pretty fast, so whoever's gonna do it needs to ask a Canadian girl out soon. 1 2 3 Not it.
"
19,2,"Stan, Craig, Kenny, Clyde, Token","Not it!
"
19,2,Butters,"No, no. Not it! Oh. OH SHIT!
"
19,2,Anchor Tom,"Support is growing for a Colorado man who claims the way to deal with illegal immigrants is to fuck them all to death. We go live to Minnesota.
"
19,2,Field Reporter,"Tom, the political activist is going around the country to get support for his agenda, and- Uh Mr. Garrison, you believe the immigration problem is easy to solve?
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yes. Fuck them all to death. Let'a make this country great again. 
"
19,2,Field Reporter,"And when you say ""Fuck them all to death,"" what are you actually suggesting be done?
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"I'm suggesting we round them all up, pull down their pants, and fuck them until their spirits leave their bodies!
"
19,2,Supporter 1,"USA!
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"And then, after we've fucked every last one of 'em to death, we build a big wall! And if anyone comes over the wall, we fuck them to death too! And then we fuck to death all the-
"
19,2,Tom,"Uh Dan? Dan? We're getting word that a wall has already been built.  Is that right? Yes? Yeah- CNN is confirming that Canada has built a wall to keep us out.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"What do you mean they built a wall?! They can't build a fucking wall! Oh, fuck them to death!
"
19,2,Guard,"Hey there! Beautiful day, isn't it?
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell is this?!
"
19,2,Guard,"Oh this? This is a wall. Sorry buddih, nobody allowed in.
"
19,2,Jimbo,"Can they do that?
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Look, we came to speak with your government about that
"
19,2,Guard,"Yeah, no, sorry! Everything past here is ours. You can't, you can't go past, past here.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"We're Americans! We don't even want to be over there! What do you think we're gonna do?
"
19,2,Guard,"Well, you know, we just don't want you ... raping our women and stuff.
"
19,2,Supporter 2,"That is ridiculous! 
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"All right, smartass! That's just about enough-
"
19,2,Guard,"Look, there's just some really cool shit back here and we don't feel like sharing it.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Cool shit like what?
"
19,2,Guard,"Don't worry about it.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"No! What's back there? Let me see!
"
19,2,Jimbo,"It's all right, Garrison.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"No! Goddammit, let me see!
"
19,2,Cartman,"What about that one? In the glasses? She's kinda hot.
"
19,2,Butters,"She's not hot! She looks like a messed-up cucumber with wieners on it!
"
19,2,Cartman,"All right, how about the lanky one, there? Ooo, ooo, What about the one in the hat? She kind of looks like Alanis Morissette, huh?
"
19,2,Butters,"Alanis Morissette is like 80 years old or something!  Jeez!
"
19,2,Cartman,"Okay, Bu-Butters, relax.
"
19,2,Butters,"Well I don't want a Canadian girlfriend, Eric!
"
19,2,Cartman,"Okay. Do you just want a race war?
"
19,2,Butters,"No! The one in the white shoes isn't that ugly.
"
19,2,Cartman,"Okay, go fuck the one in the white shoes.
"
19,2,Butters,"Okay!  Hi, my name's Butters, what's yours.
"
19,2,Charlotte,"I'm Charlotte. 
"
19,2,Butters,"Oh Charlotte, I've never done this before. You think Scar's up there? He wasn't my father, but he still part of me. Oh no, Simba, we have barely begun. We'll run away together and ... and...?
"
19,2,Cartman,"And start a pride all of our own.
"
19,2,Dan,"Tom, the scene at the Canadian border is electric as several political leaders try and strategize how to deal with being shut out of Canada. 
"
19,2,Male politician,"If the Canadian government wants to put up a wall, they have every right.
"
19,2,Female politician,"And yet, we must ask why they thought this to be necessary.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"No, fuck them and fuck you!  I wanna see if they have really cool shit back there!
"
19,2,Female politician,"What we need is a-
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"No!  You've got a gaping gash  and you've got vinegary balls! The Canadians can't do this! Don't they realize that hundreds of thousands of their people are over here illegally?
"
19,2,Guard,"Oh, you guys didn't put up a wall?
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"And you keep your goddamned mouth shut, smartass! I'll deal with you!  I get things done, and I'm gettin' back there! 
"
19,2,Butters,"Here you go.
"
19,2,Charlotte,"Thanks, Butters. I'm sore-y I didn't know what ice cream was.
"
19,2,Butters,"What's ""sore-y""?
"
19,2,Charlotte,"Well that's what Canadians say to express remorse.
"
19,2,Butters,"Oh. Heh, he-hey, heh that's neato.  Oh. Eh, hang on Charlotte, one sec.  What do you want?!
"
19,2,Cartman,"Have you given her the old Hot Cosby yet?
"
19,2,Butters,"No, we saw a movie and now we're goin' to the park.
"
19,2,Cartman,"Butters, we don't have time for that! I told you you have to cut to the chase with a Hot Cosby!
"
19,2,Butters,"If I'm gonna be with this girl, I don't want her someday thinking it was all super-rushed!
"
19,2,Cartman,"Nobody cares about forty years from now when she suddenly changes her mind, Butters?! Time is of the essence! We're all gonna die! 
"
19,2,Charlotte,"Everything all right?
"
19,2,Butters,"Yeah, it's just some work-related stuff.
"
19,2,Charlotte,"So hey, I wanted to see if you wanted to come over to my house for dinner tomorrow
"
19,2,Butters,"Oh boy, yes I'd love to, here we go, oh God.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Okay that's, that's good. Watch the balls. Okay, all right, give me the helmet.  We'll see what they've got behind that goddamned wall!  You know what I am, friends? I'm a doer.
"
19,2,Supporters,"Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"If Canada says we can't go into their country, I'm going into their country! And when I do, I am fucking every last Canadian... so hard!  All right, let's do this! 
"
19,2,Supporters,"USA USA USA USA USA!  USA USA USA!  USA US-!
"
19,2,Jimbo,"Aww, he's dead.
"
19,2,Dad,"So young man, I understand that you and my daughter have started a romance.
"
19,2,Butters,"Well uh, well yes, sir.
"
19,2,Dad,"And I suppose you have a thing for Canadian girls, huh? Is that it? You've got maple fever?
"
19,2,Charlotte,"Ey, daddy!
"
19,2,Dad,"I'm sore-y, Charlotte, but I get suspicious. It's bad enough we have to live in America, now all the boys with maple fever are gonna wanna have at our daughter.
"
19,2,Mom,"That's enough, Thomas!
"
19,2,Butters,"W-wait, you don't wanna be here?
"
19,2,Charlotte,"Why would we want to be here?
"
19,2,Butters,"Wuh well, you know, 'cause everything is great here, and we have cool stuff.
"
19,2,Thomas,"Canada has everything. It's the greatest country on Earth.
"
19,2,Butters,"But- so- then, why did you leave?
"
19,2,Thomas,"There were several candidates during the Canadian elections. One of them was this brash asshole who just spoke his mind. He didn't really offer any solutions, he just said outrageous things. we... thought it was funny.  Nobody really thought he'd ever be President. It was a joke! But we just let the joke go on for too long. He kept gaining momentum, and by the time we were all ready to say ""Okay, let's get serious now. Who should really be President?"" he was already being sworn into office.  We weren't paying attention.  We weren't paying attention! 
"
19,2,Butters,"Jeez, how bad can a president be?
"
19,2,Mr. President,"If certain people want to leave this country, let them! You tell those pussy homos they can suck my balls!
"
19,2,Johnson,"But Mr. President-
"
19,2,Mr. President,"And tell the Prime Minister of China that HE can suck my balls! Oh, and Johnson?
"
19,2,Johnson,"Mr. President?
"
19,2,Mr. President,"Suck my balls.
"
19,2,Charlotte,"I'm sore-y about my papa. He can be really emotional sometimes.
"
19,2,Butters,"You don't got to be sore-y. It's me who should be sore-y. I think everyone has the wrong idea about your people, Charlotte.
"
19,2,Charlotte,"It's okay. We just have to give them time.
"
19,2,Butters,"I wasn't supposed to have time. I was supposed to give you a Hot Cosby, so our species could coexist. But now I realize you guys don't even wanna be here.
"
19,2,Charlotte,"Oh.. so do you want to be here? Now?
"
19,2,Butters,"There's really nowhere I'd rather be.  If it's okay with you, well I'd like to try a nice Slow Cosby instead.
"
19,2,Charlotte,"In Canada, we call a Slow Cosby ... love.  Oh look!  A shooting star! In Canada, we say that's... good luck.
"
19,2,Butters,"So do we.
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Hello? 
"
19,2,Man,"Oh God! Oh God!
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Hey! Where is everyone, guy??  Jeez.
"
19,2,Mr. President,"What?? Hey! How did a US citizen get past my wall?!
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"I came here to find out where my country gone?!
"
19,2,Mr. President,"Where your country gone? Where my country gone?!
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"No, where my country gone, bitch?!
"
19,2,Mr. President,"Nobody talks to me like that, buddih! 
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Nobody talks to me like that, fwiend!  Eurgh! Yeah?
"
19,2,Mr. President,"Stupid-! Unh!
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Little asshole!
"
19,2,Mr. President,"This is why I built that wall!
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"You think you can-?  Hey! Here you go! Here you go!  Look, guy, I came here to do one thing! 
"
19,2,Mr. President,"Hey, what the-? Aah! Hey, that pokes, buddih! Aah!
"
19,2,Aide,"Oh my God, guy.
"
19,2,Mr. President,"Please! Please, I can't- Oh. NO! No please, NO! NO! [Garrison inhales some poppers, then
resumes the raping with increased vigor] Ohhh! Ohhh! Nooo!
"
19,2,Mom,"Oh look at them, Thomas. I think they really like each other.
"
19,2,Thomas,"Yes, I have to admit. It seems they're falling in Slow Cosby.  I'll get it. 
"
19,2,Canadian 6,"Hey, did you hear the news, buddih? The Canadian President has been fucked to death!
"
19,2,Canadian 7,"Yes! Yes!
"
19,2,Thomas,"What? Are you sure?
"
19,2,Mom,"What is it, Thomas?
"
19,2,Thomas,"The Canadian President got fucked to death, darling.
"
19,2,Mom,"Oh my goodness! Should we go back to Canada then?
"
19,2,Thomas,"Yes, I guess. Let's go back! 
"
19,2,Canadians,"See ya! Bye! It's been real, guy! See ya, guy! 
"
19,2,Butters,"Charlotte!
"
19,2,Charlotte,"I'll Skype you when I'm home, my love! 
"
19,2,Butters,"Ah, I should have done the Hot Cosby.
"
19,2,Supporter 3,"You did it, Garrison!
"
19,2,Supporter 4,"Thank you, Garrison!
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"Friends. I think I've proven that my policies work to get things done. I know what my true calling is, and I'm gonna keep this goin' all the way to Washington.
"
19,2,Kyle,"Hold on, wait! It wasn't me! I wasn't the one who brought the Canadians here! It was something just like this. Don't you see? If there's anything we've learned, it's that we have to stop this kind of sensationalist politics before the same thing happens to us, because if we let this kind of...  this... kind of... 
"
19,2,Cartman,"Dude!
"
19,2,Stan,"Unbelievable! 
"
19,2,Mr. Garrison,"All right, my friends. I have to say goodbye now, because I'm off to Washington with my running mate! 
"
19,2,Caitlyn Jenner,"Buckle up, buckaroo! 
"
19,3,Jimmy Fallon,"Okay okay okay. So this guy is running for President and he hates immigrants, and he's basically an idiot.  Not surprisingly, this guy is from a predominantly white town called South Park, Colorado. Or Shitheads of America, Incorporated, I'm not sure. Yeah, if this guy is the best their town has to offer, can you imagine who he left behind?  ""Oh hey, I'm from South Park! We don't take kindly to respecting human beings!""  You, you think South Park has a university? ""Welcome to South Park University.""  ""Please open your shotguns and slap your wives!""  ""I live in South Park and my IQ's so low I've got to dig for it. Hey, did someone say 'rape?' That's the word for 'clapper' here in South Park"" 
"
19,3,Randy,"That's not funny. 
"
19,3,Stan,"So not cool. How does someone just rip on us like that?
"
19,3,Kyle,"I can't believe Jimmy Fallon hates us. Jimmy Fallon loves everything. Why would he slam our whole town?
"
19,3,Cartman,"Because apparently he doesn't care that his jokes are at the expense of actual people.
"
19,3,Butters,"Wull do you think it's true? Do you think we're really bigoted country bumpkins?
"
19,3,Cartman,"No.  Hey, we are not country bumpkins! Okay?! Kenny's a bumpkin!
"
19,3,Kenny,"(Well fuck you, dude!)
"
19,3,Cartman,"We don't have junk cars in our yards, that's just your family, Kenny! 
"
19,3,Stan,"I just hope somebody finds a way to fix this.
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"I've called you all here because South Park has an image problem. Thanks to Mr. Garrison we are now being referred to as the shitheads of America. One of our more politically sensitive citizens has propose an idea for this crises and I'd like you to hear him out.
"
19,3,Randy,"Hello everyone, I'm Randy Marsh, and I've been PC for almost two weeks now. You know, we've all been making changes to be more socially conscious, but have we really done enough? The truth is, there's something we're lacking as a community, and it's time we all faced it. What this town needs... is a Whole Foods.  It would instantly validate us as town that cares about stuff.
"
19,3,Stephen,"We couldn't get a Whole Foods to open here.
"
19,3,Randy,"And why not?! Huh?! We all just don't believe we can get a Whole Foods! Because we don't believe in ourselves!
"
19,3,Fr. Maxi,"Where could it even go?!
"
19,3,Randy,"Mayor?
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"I'm announcing a plan for SodoSoPa.  A new urban development that will turn the most rundown and dilapidated part of our town into a queint center of artisan shops and cafes.
"
19,3,Randy,"Lots of cities are dong this. The area south of Downtown South Park has always been the ugly eyesore of this town. But now, SodoSoPa... is going to bring in the fresh new vibrancy that Whole Foods can't ignore.
"
19,3,Architect,"We'll keep the existing structures, but add brick walkways and some quaint white lights. A plaza in the middle will be a place where young couples can play with their toddlers.  And it will all be small businesses like artisan cheese shops or noodle houses.
"
19,3,Randy,"Oh, this is really exciting. I thought this area was just gonna stay shitty forever. 
"
19,3,Kenny,"(Hey Dad, there's fucking people outside.)
"
19,3,Stuart,"Who is? 
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"So you think you'll keep all the existing structures?
"
19,3,Architect,"I do. It's part of what gives a revitalized area like this its charm that the hipsters like.
"
19,3,Stuart,"Hey, what are you people doing?!
"
19,3,Randy,"We're gentrifying. It's all good.
"
19,3,Randy,"Okay, hold on, everyone listen up! We understand that not everyone is for the town spending money on the SodoSoPa project. We want everyone to be able to voice their concerns. 
"
19,3,Stuart,"Yeah I got concerns! I don't want you touching my damn house!
"
19,3,Johnson,"We realize that when a rejuvenation like this takes place, the lower-income residents fear they'll be priced out of the area.
"
19,3,Stuart,"What lower-income residents?! Me?! I work hard and provide for my family just fine!
"
19,3,Randy,"Stuart, come on. Your house sucks.
"
19,3,Stuart,"Fuck you! If you people wanna turn somethin' into a vibrant arts district, then do it to Randy's house!
"
19,3,Randy,"My house is nice.
"
19,3,Aide,"Mr. McCormick, you will be living in the most vibrant part of the entire town. SodoSoPa is the future of South Park.
"
19,3,Johnson,"There will be amazing food and incredible shops right at your doorstep.
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"And we want to assure the lower-income families that we are going to take the time to do this right.
"
19,3,Waiter,"Alright guys, welcome to Steed. Do we have any allergies?
"
19,3,Stephen,"No, nothing. And we we wanna try everything! 
"
19,3,Det. Harris,"Wow, can you believe this place?
"
19,3,Officer Barbrady,"Yeah, the food is unbelievable. 
"
19,3,Randy,"Like a dream come true, Nelson. This area is gonna put our town on the map. 
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"I don't know what happen all my customers. I used to have a-people come in here, fill every table. Now it's like a-nobody want anything to do with my authentic city food. This town is changing so fast, you know?  This town is changing so fast, everybody wan be PC, be updated. It's like I'm a reric. A rost reric from another time. You know? I dunno, sometime I feel like I outstayed my welcome. Is just how I feel, you know?
"
19,3,Diner,"Uh huh.
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"It's like a-my accent make people uncomftable or something. How a Chinese man is supposed to survive in this world?  Oh, welcome oh City Wok, a take ur order prease?
"
19,3,Man,"Hey Mike, whatcha doin' man? The guys are all meetin' down at SodoSoPa.
"
19,3,Mike,"At what?
"
19,3,Man,"They've totally revitalized this area south of Downtown, you've gotta check it out! 
"
19,3,Mike,"Oh sweet, dude. 
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"SodoSoPa? What the hell is a SodoSoPa?
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"What the fuuuck!
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"What the fuuuck!
"
19,3,Karen,"Mommy, can we go eat outside?
"
19,3,Mom,"No, we can't go eat outside.
"
19,3,Karen,"But Mommy, they have ice cream. 
"
19,3,Stuart,"We can't afford $10 ice cream, alright?! If you want nice things, then go out and get a JOB! Except you won't make MONEY!  Because you just BUST your ASS and then barely get by while everyone around you gets RICHER!  Just face it: things are never gonna change around here.
"
19,3,Johnson,"What's he gonna say?
"
19,3,Fr. Maxi,"Maybe they won't even know- 
"
19,3,Randy,"Hi, um, yes, my name is Randy Marsh, and um, we would like to try and get a Whole Foods in our town? ... Yes, that's right. Aaah, yes, it's ah, South Park, Colorado. Nonononono! Nononononono!  It's not at all what you think! Yes, it's where the Presidential candidate is from-Nonononono! Nononononono! Hold on! Hold on, hold on! SodoSoPa! SodoSoPa! We have a SodoSoPa and this town is completely different! SodoSoPa! We have an arts and entertainment district! Cultural! Yes. Okay. Okay, yes, I, I understand. Thank you.  They said they maybe might send over a representative. 
"
19,3,Voice,"There's a certain quality, vibe, and energy that is SodoSoPa. From the independent merchants and unique cafes to the rustic charm of a mixed-income crowd.  Where else can you let loose your wild side while still being a part of helping the local economy?  And now, a chance to own a piece of this most exciting area of South Park. Announcing: the Lofts at SodoSoPa. Two thousand square feet of class that will put you right in the heart of it all. After a night out eating and shopping in SodoSoPa, just take a few steps and you're home. With modern styling these lofts are sleek, sexy, and oh so SodoSoPa. And for those very privileged few, the most private and exclusive ownership opportunities is here. Announcing the Residences at the Lofts at SodoSoPa. Now you can have access to luxury refined while still just steps away from the action. These finely appointed residences all feature state-of-the art finishes and balconies with views of historic Kenny's house. A place to laugh. A place to gather. A place to mingle with people of all economic classes. And now, a place to live. SodoSoPa. Welcome Home.
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"And we are gong to take a-business back from a-SodoSoPa!  Ah, hello, you here for job? Prease join the others prease.  Some say I cannot survive in today's world. Butu if there's one asset that a Chinese man has, it's the tactical use of child rabor. And together, child rabor force, we are gong to bringg a SodoSoPa to its knees.
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"This is it, people! This is what we've all been working for! The future of our town depends on us being on our best behavior! No swearing, no weirdness, and no speeches! 
"
19,3,Johnson,"He's coming!
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Go! go! Everyone in place! 
"
19,3,Townsman,"Oh look!

"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"Everyone, please go about your business! I need to see this town in its normal goings on, to see if it is indeed a Whole Foods town.

"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"The previous principal of the school was let go so that someone more progressive could take over.
"
19,3,PC Principal,"Hey bro, I'm the new principal of the school. My name's PC Principal.
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"P.C. Principal. I like that. So you've just recently moved here?
"
19,3,PC Principal,"That's right.
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"And do you believe this town is deserving of a whole Foods?
"
19,3,PC Principal,"You know, I think it's changed a lot. I really do. I've seen some real progress. Definitely had some holdouts - people who went kicking and screaming into 2015, but yes, I think they deserve it.
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"Mmmmm-hm.  Show me a classroom please.
"
19,3,Teacher,"But if Pluto isn't a planet, who can tell me what it is?  Oh, hello.
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"This is our new fourth-grade teacher. She's very normal and professional.
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"Please continue as if I am not here.
"
19,3,Teacher,"Okay, so uhh children, anyone wanna tell me what Pluto is classified as?  Anybody? Okay.  Well, Pluto is actually a dwarf planet.  That means it's neither a planet nor a natural satellite, okay?
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"Is there a reason why the children with disabilities and black child are front and center? 
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh no, that's just where they always sit, next to our beloved Craig there, who is a homosexual. 
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"Mmmmm-hm.
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Uh, can, can I show you the most exciting part of town?
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"This is historic SodoSoPa. It's our vibrant and charming arts and foods district. 
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"Hmmm, I enjoy how you've retained the lower-income housing with the updated and quaint urban developments.
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"That's really what our town is about. 
"
19,3,Randy,"Oh, hello again. Stephen and I were just heading to SodoSoPa to enjoy some specialty foods. 
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"Hmmm. I have seen enough for today. I am weary. Where shall I sleep?
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh yes, of course, uh...
"
19,3,Randy,"Uh, well, tonight, you're at our Motel 6. But, we'd like to show you the plans for something extremely exciting.
"
19,3,Voice,"You can't say ""excitement"" without saying ""SodoSoPa."" The food, the art, the nightlife. With the Lofts and Residences at SodoSoPa, all the action was just a few steps away. But what if you could actually live in the most central location that SodoSoPa has to offer? Well, now you can. Announcing: the Villas at Kenny's House. The most sought-after address in all of South Park for only the very privileged few. Now you can relax in your state-of-the-art deck spa while taking in views of that mixed SodoSoPa culture. 
"
19,3,Stuart,"Shut your damn mouth, bitch!
"
19,3,Mom,"You shut your mouth or I'll shut-
"
19,3,Voice,"But that's not all. The Villas at Kenny's house will also feature access toa private fitness center, clubhouse, and so much more. Plus a breezeway to the proposed Whole Foods just steps away.  The Villas at Kenny's House. Welcome Home.
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Hey, that's okay. We close. All the other child laber go home.
"
19,3,Kenny,"(I just wanna make sure I get the floor as clean as I can.)
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"I like you, Dennis. You work a real hard.  I wish I could give you more. You deserve more.  But I think I'm gonna have to shut down. Now that SodoSoPa open, I'm the shitty part of town. And everyone hates the shitty part of town.
"
19,3,Kenny,"(Yeah. I know what you mean.)
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh, what do you know about living in the shitty part of town, Dennis?
"
19,3,Kenny,"(Hey, I have an idea.)
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"You have idea?
"
19,3,Kenny,"(I actually do!)
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh! That's the spirit! Let's go child rabor!  Let's go child rabor! 
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"So these are the cattle that the local shops and restaurants are supplied with.
"
19,3,Rancher,"Uh... these are local cows, yes.
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"And where does the butchery take place?
"
19,3,Rancher,"Uh, that's right over there. 
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"And are the bullets made from reclaimed metals?
"
19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"I believe they are. Rancher, could you make sure?
"
19,3,Fr. Maxi,"Randy, Stephen, we;ve got a big problem! The owner of City Wok has child labor making videos for him!
"
19,3,Richard,"What??
"
19,3,Randy,"Oh Jesus! We forgot all about that guy!
"
19,3,Bob,"Shhh!
"
19,3,Fr. Maxi,"It's all over the place. He's tryin' to revitalize his rundown neighborhood! 
"
19,3,Randy,"God, why do the economically challenged always have to screw up everything?!  We're gonna head back to SodoSoPa for some curious fusion delights.  Come on, we'll get that asshole!
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"There's a new and exciting prace where people can gather to shop, experience and grow. This is an all-new food and nightrife district. This, is CtPaTown. Where else but CtPaTown can you get all the city hot spots and city food that South Park is known for? In the mood for some local seafood? Red Robster has all the freshest from Colorado's many oceans. Or if a handcrafted ale is more your thing, head on down to Skeeter's Bar for local ales like a Coors or a Coors Rite. And then, of course, there's City Wok, South Park historic Asian fusion randmark, featuring City Chicken and City Sour Soup. The state-of-the-art toilet is designed for men and women  and is a great place for you to squeeze out all the city food you've enjoyed. Now South Park has another neighborhood to mingle and rerax. CtPaTown. Welcome Home.
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh boy, get ready child rabor force! Any minute now, we gonna have a-customers up our ass!
"
19,3,Townfolk,"Get him! There he is! That son of a bitch! Get him! Stop him!
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh boy, here they come! You were right, Dennis! CtPaTown commercial did the trick!  Get ready for customers, child rabor force!  Welcome City Wok, take your order PREASE. 
"
19,3,Kenny,"(What. The. Fuck?!) 
"
19,3,Randy,"Alright, take these kids and hide them in the-
"
19,3,Kenny,"(Come on, dude, I've gotta make some money!)
"
19,3,Randy,"Ow! You little-! 
"
19,3,Girl,"Get him! 
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Fight, child rabor force! Swing to the reft!
"
19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"Ahem, ahem!  I've never seen a town put so much energy into displaying an exaggerated sense of social consciousness. Congratulations, you have your Whole Foods. 
"
19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Wait wait, anybody want City Chicken?? Anybody?? Take ur order prease???  I'm sorry, Dennis. You rearry tried to help. I guess it's over. Come on inside. I'll pay you the child rabor wage you deserve.
"
19,3,Stuart,"Well? Did you make any money?
"
19,3,Kenny,"(No, I didn't make any money.) 
"
19,3,Stuart,"Ha, told ya! That's how it works in this damned country.
"
19,3,Karen,"What are you doing, Kenny?  Wow! This is mine?
"
19,3,Kenny,"(It's yours, Karen) 
"
19,3,Karen,"Hi. 
"
19,3,Voice,"There's a time when a town becomes more than it was.  When the people take that bold step into making things better.  To progress.  To change.  To not be what you were in the past.  This is a new place, ready for the next decade.  Updated, revitalized,  and ready to fit in with the most progressive towns in America.  This... is South Park.  Welcome Home.
"
19,3,Cartman,"Are the Mexicans actually staying?
"
19,3,Kyle,"Shhhh.
"
19,4,Gerald,"Mornin' Randy!
"
19,4,Randy,"Mornin' Ger! Just another day in paradise, huh?
"
19,4,Gerald,"Yeah. Look at all the new restaurants the Whole Foods has brought in.  Let's try out that one there. 
"
19,4,Randy,"Hi. Two of us. please?
"
19,4,Greeter,"Yeah, sorry guys. we got about a thirty minute wait.
"
19,4,Gerald,"Oh, uh, scuse me. 
"
19,4,Greeter,"Yes, sir, give me a second; I'll have a table right away. 
"
19,4,Randy,"Whoa, what'd you say to him?
"
19,4,Gerald,"I just... told him who I am.
"
19,4,Randy,"Who are you?
"
19,4,Gerald,"I'm a yelp reviewer. I usually keep it on the down-low so they don't kiss my ass too much.
"
19,4,Greeter,"Right over here, sir. 
"
19,4,Waiter,"Alright guys, welcome to (vernacular)
"
19,4,Gerald,"Thanks, uh, did they mention to you that I am a Yelper?
"
19,4,Waiter,"Yes, we've been alerted. Sir.
"
19,4,Gerald,"Greeeat. Could you have them turn up the light s a little, please? 
"
19,4,Randy,"Oh, look at it, Gerald. All the new families moving in.  Our little town is all grown up.
"
19,4,Father,"Where's that other taco plate? We need it now.
"
19,4,Mother,"I'm a little overwhelmed.
"
19,4,Father,"I know. But we've put everything into moving here and starting this business, and we have to be impressive.  Davíd, you must help your mama however you can. We're not going back to that miserable place!
"
19,4,Davíd,"I don't wanna go back either.
"
19,4,Mother,"Okay, done.
"
19,4,Father,"Great!  We really have to impress this customer. He's the local food critic. 
"
19,4,Mother,"Another one?
"
19,4,Father,"Okay, here you go, amigo! Another taco plate and the taquitos.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp?
"
19,4,Father,"Yes, you mentioned that several times.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Okay, I just didn't want you caught off-guard.  I was thinking of giving this place 5 stars.
"
19,4,Father,"Really?
"
19,4,Cartman,"Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering on 5 stars or 1 star.
"
19,4,Father,"Ohnono. No 1 star, please. What could we do to-?
"
19,4,Cartman,"Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts.
"
19,4,Father,"Let me get that for you.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Great, and can you turn down the music a bit?  This pagan shit hurts my ears.
"
19,4,Father,"Of course! 
"
19,4,Cartman,"Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor.  Busboy!
"
19,4,Davíd,"My name is Davíd.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Ehexcuse me?
"
19,4,Davíd,"I said my name is Davíd.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Uhh, it's actually pronounced ""David,"" okay?
"
19,4,Davíd,"Well, I'm ""Davíd.""
"
19,4,Cartman,"It's ""David,"" dude. Look it up.
"
19,4,Father,"What's going on? Do not argue, son. We need him.  Here you are, a few free desserts.  Ho, excuse me. More customers! 
"
19,4,Male food critic,"Hi, two of us for lunch, please.
"
19,4,Father,"Yes, right away!
"
19,4,Male food critic,"Oh, and uh, I just wanted to mention that my wife and I are Yelp reviewers, so uh, your best table, please.
"
19,4,Father,"Oh Jeez, you guys too, huh? Ho-kay, uhm, I'll get you set up right over here, okay? 
"
19,4,Cartman,"Mmmhmmm! 
"
19,4,Male food critic,"Hm, this place seems, nice.
"
19,4,Female food critic,"I guess we'll see.
"
19,4,Male food critic,"D'I guess we'll see, won't we?
"
19,4,Cartman,"Oh God, now everyone thinks they're a food critic.
"
19,4,Butters,"Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Huh?
"
19,4,Cartman,"Here you go. 
"
19,4,Butters,"Whoooaaa. 
"
19,4,Cartman,"Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden.
"
19,4,Butters,"How do you do it, Eric?
"
19,4,Cartman,"I'm a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want.
"
19,4,Butters,"Jeeeeezzz. 
"
19,4,Kyle,"So the cafeteria's back that way, and most of the classrooms are this way, down the-.
"
19,4,Cartman,"EEWW.  What's the busboy doing here?
"
19,4,Kyle,"Davíd is new to our school.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to school?  Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh?
"
19,4,Kyle,"Shut up.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Look amigo, I'm sorry I only gave your parents' restaurant two stars, but it could have been worse.
"
19,4,Davíd,"Why'd you only give them two stars?
"
19,4,Cartman,"I'm sorry, but the food totally messed my stomach up. The morning after I ate it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all.
"
19,4,Kyle,"It's not supposed to have water you-!
"
19,4,Cartman,"It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It was like being raped from the inside. Your parents' restaurant just wasn't up to my standards, David.
"
19,4,Davíd,"Davíd.
"
19,4,Cartman,"David.
"
19,4,Davíd,"Dah-víd.
"
19,4,Cartman,"David.
"
19,4,Davíd,"Dah-víííd.
"
19,4,Cartman,"David David David David! I can update this to a one-star review in two seconds, dude.  ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic.
"
19,4,Gerald's review,"And yet, there was more. For in this crisp time when autumn begins to fade, the chef brings chicken in habanero, and even adds habanero powder to the crust. But the heat is restrained. You experience the fruity, delicious flavor of this without any spicy pain. I don't need any more pain. Hell, does anyone?
"
19,4,Sheila,"Gerald! We're going to the park. You wanna come along?
"
19,4,Gerald,"Sorry honey, this review for Applebee's has turned into a fifty-pager. And then I have a polish on Ruby Tuesday's.
"
19,4,Sheila,"Why don't you take a break from Yelping, Gerald? You seem a little overwhelmed.
"
19,4,Gerald,"I am, overwhelmed. Sometimes I don't know what I've gotten myself into. But now everyone relies on my Yelp reviews and I... I don't wanna let anyone down.
"
19,4,Sheila,"Well there's chicken in the fridge if you get hungry.
"
19,4,Gerald,"Thanks, but I, I've gotta Yelp a new place in CtPaTown tonight.  God I'm so damned tired.
"
19,4,Sheila,"Okay. Have fun.
"
19,4,Gerald,"Ha, ""fun,"" she says.
"
19,4,Gerald's review,"In finality, I will say that my experience at Applebee's was sublime and my treatment near that of a gladiator most decorated. But the street parking wasn't that great. Two and a half stars.
"
19,4,Gerald,"Yes.
"
19,4,Wendy,"Come on, Liza, I'll introduce you to the girls.
"
19,4,Butters,"Well aren't ya eatin' lunch, Eric?
"
19,4,Cartman,"Uhuh, I'm a food critic, Butters, okay? I can't just eat cafeteria food.
"
19,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"O-okay, sir! Here you are! There's orange-peel chicken, some uh city beef, and uh city egg rolls!
"
19,4,Kyle,"Are you joking?!
"
19,4,Cartman,"Well, you are a little late, like, I dunno, maybe only  one star late.
"
19,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh no! No one star, prease! You Uelpers are kriwing me! Okay, you no pay! You no pay, prease!
"
19,4,Cartman,"Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here.
"
19,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"Yes yes. I get the fuck out. Thank you! 
"
19,4,Butters,"Wow! Well you're pretty important, Eric.
"
19,4,Kyle,"He's not important. At. All.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Yes, no no, you you're right, Kyle. I'm not important. Oh, hey David, I was just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh?
"
19,4,Stan,"Stop it.
"
19,4,Cartman,"What? I just want to hear him say ""Sí, me ride me tiny bicicleta to schooool.""
"
19,4,Davíd,"Sí, me ride me teeny bicicleta to school.
"
19,4,Cartman,"That's awesome!  I'm gonna go out to recess. Will you bus this for me, David. Thanks. 
"
19,4,Kyle,"Ah,  don't, dude, dude- Don't.
"
19,4,Barkley,"Sir, it's midnight. Go home, get some sleep.
"
19,4,Sgt. Yates,"There's no time to sleep when the city's depending on me.
"
19,4,Barkley,"More Yelp reviews, sir?
"
19,4,Sgt. Yates,"I had a bad experience at Red Lobster and if the people don't know about it, they could too. Folks deserve to know where they eat, Mitch.
"
19,4,Barkley,"But does anyone even thank you for it?
"
19,4,Sgt. Yates,"I don't need them to. I know they need me, and that's enough.
"
19,4,Barkley,"God bless you, sir.
"
19,4,Sgt. Yates,"I know. 
"
19,4,Whistlin' Willy,"Welcome to Whistlin' Willy's. You all enjoyin' your pizza?
"
19,4,Male food critic,"Look here, my good man, we've been waiting over 15 minutes for you to sing Happy Birthday to our son!
"
19,4,Female food critic,"Unfortunately for you, we are both restaurant critics, and so is our son!
"
19,4,Son,"One star!
"
19,4,Diner 1,"Excuse me! Emergency!  Over here! Emergency! I would like a table. Inside the area with all the little plastic balls please, and make it snappy I am a food critic for Yelp.

19,4,Whistlin' Willy,"That does it! I've had enough! All you Yelp reviewers get the hell outta here! I don't care what happens to my business! I ain't kissing your asses no more!  Go on! Every Yelper get the fuck out of here!
"
19,4,Diner 2,"Careful now, Bill, you don't want a one-star review.
"
19,4,Whistlin' Willy,"You're not a food critic, Dennis! You're a fuckin' mechanic! Now get the fuck out! Go on! All you Yelpin' sons of bitches get the fuck out of here! 
"
19,4,Male food critic,"You're gonna regret this, Whistlin' Willy. You can't treat Yelpers this way.
"
19,4,Whistlin' Willy,"You get the f- Get the fuck out of here! 
"
19,4,Male food critic,"AH!

19,4,Gerald,"Well, good for you.

"
19,4,Father,"It's a ...miracle.  IT'S A MIRACLE! 
"
19,4,Cartman,"Hm hm hm the fuck?  Aw, dude, somebody spilled shit on the floor!  Hey David, somebody spilled something here. Could you clean this up, por favor? David.  Over here, there's some shit on the floor.  Heyheyhey hey! What's goin' on, man?
"
19,4,Kyle,"You haven't heard? Nobody gives a fuck what Yelp reviewers think anymore.
"
19,4,Cartman,"What are you talking about? I'm the most influential critic in this town. Okay David, forget the spill, just give me one little ""My name is David. Me ride me biciceta to schoool""
"
19,4,Davíd,"My name... is Davíd. 
"
19,4,Kyle,"HA! 
"
19,4,Cartman,"Okay, I'm uh I'm updating my review. I'm about to do it.  You'd better start riding a bicicleta to school!  One star! ... No s-no stars?  No stars? ... You can't just treat me like I'm nothing... I still know I'm worth something! Come on, guys!  Oh yeah, y-you guys stay in school, that's good. That's good. 
"
19,4,Butters,"Oh, hey Eric.
"
19,4,Cartman,"It's all over, Butters. Everything I've worked so hard to achieve. All these hack wannabe food critics have made my profession a joke.
"
19,4,Butters,"Oh I'm sorry, bud.
"
19,4,Cartman,"All these people trying to be like me. And they don't even write about poop consistency the next day.
"
19,4,Butters,"Well Eric, you should be proud that people wanna be like you. Ha ah, I mean, you really started something.
"
19,4,Cartman,"I guess.
"
19,4,Butters,"Well these people look up to you, maybe, maybe you can sort of ,set the record straight and show them the way it's supposed to be done.
"
19,4,Cartman,"You're right, Butters. Maybe I can actually use all these people somehow to make... real food critics respected again.
"
19,4,Maggie,"Harrison Yates, what's gotten into you?
"
19,4,Yates,"That's it, Maggie. I'm hanging it up. If people are gonna be trying all the new restaurants in town they'll... have to do it without my reviews.
"
19,4,Maggie,"What are ya talkin' about? You said that protectin' people from bad dinin' experiences was what kept you goin'.
"
19,4,Yates,"The restaurants put up signs sayin' I I can't come in. I don't know why they singled me out, but it's like, people don't need me.  Well I'll be damned.
"
19,4,Maggie,"What is it?
"
19,4,Yates,"Somebody's put a note in the mailbox... asking me to come and talk to them. They do need me.  I need to get goin'.
"
19,4,Maggie,"Want me to come along?
"
19,4,Yates,"No, they're just asking for me. I guess...  maybe I do have a town to protect. 
"
19,4,Liane,"Oh, are you having a party sweetheart?
"
19,4,Cartman,"Not a part, Mom. I've invited all the poser food critics over for a meeting.
"
19,4,Liane,"Oh, how fun!
"
19,4,Cartman,"It's not fun, it's serious. These people think they can do what I do, but they need to be, but they need to be made to understand the reality. When the Yelpers get here I need you to get lost, okay? Okay, that's them, that's them. Go, get lost, Mom! 
"
19,4,Yelpers,"Hello, hi. My name is  and I'm here for the meeting. 
"
19,4,A reviewer,"Is this the right place?
"
19,4,Cartman,"Fuck!  Mom!
"
19,4,Liane,"I'm going, honey.
"
19,4,Cartman,"But Mom, there's like a billion people here.
"
19,4,Liane,"Oh yes, sweetie, I think quite a few people are Yelp reviewers.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Oh, this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on Yelp?!
"
19,4,Liane,"I guess so, honey. Do you need more lemonade?
"
19,4,Cartman,"Mom, there's a fucking billion people here!  Uh, thank you all for coming. My name is Eric, and as you know, us Yelpers are being scrutinized-
"
19,4,A Yelper,"COULD YOU SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER?
"
19,4,Cartman,"Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized.
"
19,4,Other Yelpers,"That's right! Yeah!
"
19,4,Cartman,"Now, you see, the problem is that when there's too many reviewers, people no longer know who is the real food critic.  It's great that you all want to be critics, but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is.
"
19,4,Other Yelpers,"That's right. Yeah!
"
19,4,Gerald,"Huh. Oh thanks.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Okay. So, as long as there is one clear leader, then the rest of you can just follow. And with this many people all following  one captain, we can fight to get our power back!
"
19,4,A Yelper,"Captaaaain Black!
"
19,4,Cartman,"So now rise up, and  fight for your leader!! Fight together and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter!
"
19,4,Other Yelpers,"Yeah! Let's go! 
"
19,4,Sgt. Yates,"Alright, follow me!
"
19,4,Gerald,"This way, everyone! 
"
19,4,Anchor Tom,"Another local business is closing its doors tonight after being taken down by local Yelp reviewers. Whistlin' Willy's, a child favorite in town, was destroyed and its own stripped and beheaded. The following video is graphic. 
"
19,4,Whistlin' Willy,"Don't, please! No! Nonono! 
"
19,4,Kyle,"We all... loved... Whistlin' Willy's!
"
19,4,Cartman,"It didn't do well with Yelpers.
"
19,4,Token,"You assholes destroyed the best place in town because they wouldn't kiss your asses!
"
19,4,Cartman,"Oh come on, admit it. The food sucked.
"
19,4,Kyle,"Nobody went for the fucking food!
"
19,4,Cartman,"Look, I'm sorry goys, but Whistlin' Willy's failed to recognize the influence someone like me has on their business. Now, I just have one question for you, David. Do you ride... your teeny, tiny, bicicleta... to school?
"
19,4,Davíd,"Si. Me ride me teeny bicicleta to school. 
"
19,4,Kyle,"You're done! 
"
19,4,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm done! I'm now the leader of thousands of people! They all hang on my every word!  And I'm gonna use my power to finally get what this town really needs.
"
19,4,Gerald's review,"I found the wait staff at Red Lobster to be rude, and barely even acknowledging who I was. Or what I meant to this city.
"
19,4,Sheila,"Gerald, I'm taking Ike to clown school. You care to joing us?
"
19,4,Gerald,"I can't, honey. I'm now the leader of thousands of people. They all hang on my every word. And I'm going to use my power to finally get what this town really needs. 
"
19,4,Reporter,"For the fifth day in a row, historic Shi Tpa Town is under siege by Yelp reviewers. The restaurants are still refusing to be intimidated. and the Yelp reviewers are-  -and the Yelp reviewers are preparing for all-out war.  The angry Yelp reviewers are demanding special treatment at all city restaurants. They claim that as local food critics they reserve respect, and that all who oppose them will suffer. The online restaurant critics are getting ready to bring businesses to their knees, and some are already closing their doors. 
"
19,4,Reporter,"One local restaurant worker actually called out the Yelp critics' leader.
"
19,4,Davíd,"I guess you win, huh, big shot?! If you really are any kind of important to anybody, then get your bullshit food critic ass to the south of town and face me! Because you aren't a food critic, and you aren't important!  And unless you're a chicken, I'll see you south of town! 
"
19,4,Barkley,"Where are you going, sir?
"
19,4,Sgt. Yates,"You heard him. Little Mexican kid called me out.  If he wants to fight me, that's fine.
"
19,4,Barkley,"You need backup sir?
"
19,4,Sgt. Yates,"No, he's just calling me out. 
"
19,4,Barkley,"God bless you sir.
"
19,4,Sgt. Yates,"I know!
"
19,4,Kyle,"Davíd! Dude, wait!  Dude, you don't wanna do this. You don't know what Cartman's capable of.
"
19,4,Davíd,"Where I come from, we settle things with our fists!
"
19,4,Kyle,"But this isn't Mexico.
"
19,4,Davíd,"I'm not from Mexico, dude! I'm from Idaho!  I'm gonna show this prick how we do things in Boise!
"
19,4,Cartman,"Oh, hello David! 
"
19,4,Kyle,"Alright, you've got your army! You've got your followers! If you're such a great leader, then just tell the city what you want, fatass!
"
19,4,Gerald,"Don't call me fat, son! I'm doing this because they've-
"
19,4,Sgt. Yates,"What I want is to be able to lead these fine people with the respect and the dignity-
"
19,4,Yelper 1,"I didn't ask to be a leader, I was appointed! You see, I'm extremely important to this town, and I'm not going to be-
"
19,4,Yelper 2,"My journey is this town's food- 
"
19,4,Yelper 3,"You've made these people feel unwanted, and now they look to me for answers.
"
19,4,Gerald,"Now here I stand, vulnerable, afraid, and yet willing to do what the people of this-
"
19,4,Female food critic,"And so we said ""to hell with it!"" And we took the challenge to go from the town's food critics to the town's spiritual leaders! What do we want?
"
19,4,Yelper 4,"People would say ""Oh, you're just a food blogger. You're just a timy voice in the crowd. Well now my voice is heard, and I will-"" 
"
19,4,Cartman,"...wanted special privileges, but these people think I should have them! Right, guys? Maybe I don't deserve special treatment, but how else can I be the elite food critic they want? 
"
19,4,Kyle,"Every person here thinks this is about them.
"
19,4,Davíd,"I think I know what to do.
"
19,4,Kyle,"Yeah. Me too.
"
19,4,Mayor McDaniels,"And for all your service to this community, we want to once and for all declare you our most elite food critic. To distinguish you, we present to you... the Golden Badge.  Wearing this badge means you will always get the special treatment that you deserve. 
"
19,4,Gerald,"Thank you, Mayor. It's a big responsibility, but I suppose I have to accept. I will do my best to serve this town.
"
19,4,Mayor McDaniels,"We know you will. 
"
19,4,Kyle,"Okay, bring in the next one.
"
19,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Davis, you have proven yourself a leader. And for all your service to this community, we want to once and for all declare you our most elite food critic. To distinguish you, we present the Golden Badge. 
"
19,4,Mr. Davis,"Wwooww.
"
19,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Wearing this badge means you will always get the special treatment you deserve. 
"
19,4,Davíd,"Alright, we got all the restaurant to agree to let the Yelpers in and make them feel special.
"
19,4,Father,"How did you do it, son?
"
19,4,Diner 3,"Hi, yes, the steak, please.  I'm the uh Yelp elite. 
"
19,4,Waiter,"Alright, we got a Yelper. Give 'er that special attention.
"
19,4,Chef,"Youuu got it! 
"
19,4,Lead Singer,"So you're one of Yelpers' special blessed.
You demand a restaurant's very best.
Well they're gonna treat you special, I'm tellin' you, chum.

"
19,4,Backup Singers,"Boogers and cum.
"
19,4,Lead Singer,"That's called the Yelper's Special!
"
19,4,Backup Singers,"Boogers and cum.
"
19,4,Lead Singer,"Say, what's that on your pretzel?
"
19,4,Lead Singer,"Your online critiques are real useful to some.
"
19,4,Backup Singers,"Oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo
"
19,4,Lead Singer,"Now have a good time eatin' boogers and cum.
"
19,4,Backup Singers,"Boogers and cum.

19,4,Lead Singer,"Someone farted on your salad.
"
19,4,Backup Singers,"Boogers and cum.
"
19,4,Lead Singer,"But your décor critiques are valid.

19,4,Lead Singer,"You think you're special, like you're A #1!

"
19,4,Davíd,"Here you are, sir.

19,4,Cartman,"Why thank you, David. That's good service.
"
19,4,Davíd,"I will bring you food every day, my friend.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Mmmm, is that a jalapeño cream sauce?
"
19,4,Davíd,"Yes. My father made it just for youuu.
"
19,4,Cartman,"Hmmm. It's tart, but savory.
"
19,4,Backup Singers,"Boogers and cum.
"
19,4,Lead Singer,"Bein' a food critic's easy!
"
19,4,Backup Singers,"Boogers and cum.

"
19,5,PC Principal,"So these guys made fun of your weight and made you feel ashamed?
"
19,5,Cartman,"Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said I was fat.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Alright, why don't you take me back to what happened?
"
19,5,Cartman,"I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by  Then I looked in the mirror and I thought I looked kind of ripped, and so I asked one of the kids  if he would take a picture of me  and he did. And I looked at the picture and I looked pretty ripped, so later at home, I put the picture up on my Yelp account and I typed in ""Don't I look ripped?"" and I thought people would be stoked on me. Then this morning I saw the comments on Twitter and some people called me names and said I wasn't ripped, and they said that I was fat and I didn't have muscles. The Internet made fun of me and 
"
19,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well, Eric, maybe you shouldn't have put a picture of you in your underwear up on social media.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Hey! You got a fuckin' problem Mackey!
"
19,5,Mr. Mackey,"N-No, PC Principal.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Because body-shaming is fuckin' serious, and I'm not gonna allow that shit in my school!  Nobody should have to feel that kind of shame!
"
19,5,Cashier,"Okay. sir, looks like your total is $37.83.
"
19,5,Randy,"Alright.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Okay, and, would you like to add a dollar donation to help hungry kids around the world?
"
19,5,Randy,"Oh uh, no, that, that's okay.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Sorry?
"
19,5,Randy,"I'm, I'm good.
"
19,5,Cashier,"I'm sorry, you don't want to give the dollar to hungry kids?
"
19,5,Randy,"Not today, thank you.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Okay, no problem.  A window's gonna come up and ask if you're helping the hungry kids, just hit ""No, I'm not.""
"
19,5,Randy,"Oh, come on.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Try hitting it again. It's the box below the one that says, ""Sure, I'd love to help however I can.""  Ah, darn thing. Sorry. Most people give the dollar. I can do this manually. 
"
19,5,Randy,"Look, I give money to charity a lot, okay?
"
19,5,Cashier,"Oh, sure you do.
"
19,5,Randy,"I do. I just don't want to every time I shop for food.
"
19,5,Cashier,"That's completely understandable.  ""Have customer speak on the-"" Oh-okay. if you can just speak into the voice decoder and say ""I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids.""
"
19,5,Randy,"I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids. 
"
19,5,Cashier,"Okay, that's got it. So with the ice cream, the vodka, pizza pockets, and nothing for hungry kids, that's $37.83.  Oh, don't forget your change.
"
19,5,Randy,"Look, if I give money every time I went grocery-shopping, I would be-!
"
19,5,Cashier,"Thanks for shopping, sir. Next, please.
"
19,5,Randy,"Dick!
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Morning, Kyle. Have a seat right there.  You probably heard that Eric here has been dealing with some body shaming? 
"
19,5,Kyle,"Uh huh.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Well Eric and I have been talking, and we've decided it's probably best for him to get off of social media.
"
19,5,Kyle,"Yeah probably.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"So what we're looking for is a student volunteer. Somebody who can put what Eric wants up on the Internet for him and also filter through all the comments and make it more os a safe space for him.
"
19,5,Kyle,"Wait, what?
"
19,5,Cartman,"I said you were perfect because you're really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time  so you'd probably do a really good job.
"
19,5,Kyle,"You want me to run Cartman's Twitter and Yelp accounts and only give him the good comments?
"
19,5,PC Principal,"That's right.
"
19,5,Kyle,"No.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Kyle, you know what body-shaming is, right? How much it can hurt someone's life? All you have to do is check out all the comments, type out just the positive ones, and give that to Eric on paper.
"
19,5,Kyle,"If he doesn't like what people say on Twitter, he can get off. 
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Okay Kyle, well maybe you'd like two weeks' detention instead.
"
19,5,Kyle,"Give me... give me detention.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"You sure about that?
"
19,5,Kyle,"Yeah, I'll take the detention.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"That's two weeks' detention for you, bud! I'll see you at 4!  And when we said someone should probably help Eric by filtering out any negative comments, he mentioned you by name.
"
19,5,Wendy,"Is this a joke?
"
19,5,Cartman,"I'm not a joke!
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Nothing funny about this, Testaburger! This is a big problem in our country!
"
19,5,Wendy,"I'm not doing it.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"And that's two weeks' detention for you! Congratulations!  So, any comment that seem inappropriate or hurtful in any way, you need to delete and not include in your daily report to Eric. 
"
19,5,Cartman,"I wanted someone smart and hard-working!
"
19,5,Butters,"Do I gotta?
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Do you want detention?
"
19,5,Butters,"Well if I get detention, uh I'll get grounded.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Then you start today! Butters, it's your job to make sure Eric has a safe space.
"
19,5,Female Shopper,"Oh ahhh, I'm sorry.
"
19,5,Randy,"Oh no, my, my fault.
"
19,5,Female Shopper,"Isn't it great having a Whole Foods?
"
19,5,Randy,"This is where I come for lunch every day. Gotta eat healthy to stay fit.  Aw, shit, it's that guy. 
"
19,5,Cashier,"Aand how are you tody, sir?
"
19,5,Randy,"Great.  Uh, listen, before you ring me up, I just wanna let you know I'm not gonna be giving extra money to charity, so can we, can we just skip that part?
"
19,5,Cashier,"Oh no problem sir, they've updated the system so it's a lot more streamlined now. Find everything you need today?
"
19,5,Randy,"Yeah, thanks.
"
19,5,Cashier,"There we go, and that's... Okay, and would you like to give a dollar to hungry kids today?
"
19,5,Randy,"No. I said no, before.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Oh that's right. Okay, there's a picture of a little hungry boy. Will you just press on his belly?  Okay, that's got it. So, with the no help for hungry kids that's $18.87.  Out of 20.  Your change is right there, just pull the sandwich out of the little girl's mouth. 
"
19,5,Randy,"This is not streamlined!
"
19,5,Cashier,"It's just a new change dispenser, sir. 
"
19,5,Randy,"I can't.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Yes, she's a hungry one. You've gotta pull hard.
"
19,5,Randy,"Dammit! The sandwich isn't coming out.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Try putting your foot on her face.  Have a nice day, sir!
"
19,5,Randy,"I was having a nice day! 
"
19,5,Butters,"Eric, hold up.
"
19,5,Cartman,"There you are. You have my social media comments?
"
19,5,Butters,"Yeah. Yeah, right here.  I just finished this morning.
"
19,5,Cartman,"Mm-hm. Hm-oh, that's nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments?
"
19,5,Butters,"Yeah. And the people commenting on your Yelp page starts here. 
"
19,5,Cartman,"Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great!  Oh Kyle! You thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? You should see all the comments I'm getting. People are actually really stoked on me now.
"
19,5,Butters,"It's a pretty brutal job sifting through all that darkness.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. In order to better understand the negative effects of body-shaming, we have a-  HEY LESLIE! PUT A FUCKIN' SOCK IN IT!  We have a guest speaker today who will challenge our perceptions of physical beauty.  So please welcome action star and hero, Steven Seagal. 
"
19,5,Steven Seagal,"You've got a problem with me? I'm your worse nightmare. I have ne fear of death. More importantly, I don't fear life.  I'm a big action movie star and people are pretty stoked on me. And then I put a picture of myself up on the Internet and I had my shirt off and I said ""Do you think I'm ripped?"" and some people commented saying I didn't look ripped, that I was fat, and they called me Steven Seaboomboom, so I put another picture on the Internet and I thought people would be stoked on me, but they said that I looked like a fat bird, and they said I wasn't buff.  Body-shaming isn't cool, and, if p-people shame you on the Internet, you have to make sure that you stay, you stay strong and tell everyone you're proud of how you look, like this. 
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Hey, Seagal! Listen, that was a really amazing talk you gave to the kids.
"
19,5,Steven Seagal,"Thank you.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"I can see that you're in a lot of pain, bro. I've got someone who I thank can help.  So I want you to do for Mr. Seagal the same thing that you're doing for Eric Cartman.
"
19,5,Butters,"But PC Principal, I really don't have time.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"This man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness! I think you can give him a little of your time!
"
19,5,Butters,"Yes sir...
"
19,5,Cashier,"Find everything you needed today?
"
19,5,Randy,"Yes.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98. Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?
"
19,5,Randy,"Yes, I would like to give a dollar.
"
19,5,Cashier,"You want to give a dollar?
"
19,5,Randy,"Yes, I will.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Oh wow, okay! So that's $10 for the beer, $4.20 in chocolate-covered peanuts, $26 in filet mignons, and one dollar for hungry kids around the world. On ""amount of donation"" it will say $10, $20, or $50, can you just press the ""$1"" box?  Attention shoppers, somebody just joined the $1 club, giving one whole dollar to help feed hungry children.  Here's your T-shirt!  Ho, won't the kids be thrilled when they get their piece of that big impressive dollar.  For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a holly good fellow, for he's a holly good fellow! He ended world hunger. 
"
19,5,Butters,"Yech. Oh God that's terrible. Oh Jesus.
"
19,5,Demi Lovato,"Yeah. No, I'm telling you, Tracy, it's the greatest thing ever. I'm getting all my Twitter and Instagram comments on paper, and the nasty mean stuff, all gets edited out.
"
19,5,Butters,"Whoa my God. Wugh.
"
19,5,Demi Lovato,"Yeah. And the coolest thing? Ever since I started using this service, all of my followers are actually way more stoked on me. So cool, right?
"
19,5,Cartman,"Butters!
"
19,5,Butters,"Yeah!
"
19,5,Cartman,"What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says ""This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!""
"
19,5,Butters,"Well I'm sorry, Eric. I, I guess it slipped through the cracks. I'm overloaded with all the new people.
"
19,5,Cartman,"What new people? 
"
19,5,Butters,"Well I've got Demi Lovato  to take care of now, and Lena Dunham just put a picture of her asshole on Twitter, and wants only the positive comments.
"
19,5,Cartman,"Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed!
"
19,5,Demi Lovato,"Am so! But I don't care. People just have to accept my body the way it is.
"
19,5,Cartman,"Butters, I want this fixed by tonight, you got that!
"
19,5,Butters,"Okay, Eric. 
"
19,5,Randy,"This is a place where hope is scarce. These people are hungry. Little Jojo here might not eat today. But does that mean it's okay for cashiers to ask us for money while we're in the checkout line? It isn't right, and it isn't fair. Just $2 a day adds up to 62 goddamned dollars a month if you go to Whole Foods as much as I do. Nobody should have to feel the shame, the humiliation, of being asked to add money onto their grocery bill. Help out. Let's make grocery stores a #SAFESPACE for all. Together, we can make a difference.
"
19,5,Girl,"Because charity-shaming hurts everyone. 
"
19,5,PC Principal,"You know, if there's one thing I really respect, it's plus-sized models who challenge the idea of what makes a woman beautiful. These ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign for plus-sized lingerie, and we wanna make sure they're protected from any harassing comments.
"
19,5,Butters,"Do I have to, sir?
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Hey, they're gonna putting themselves out there, and all I'm asking you to do is go through their social media and delete the two or three comments that are mean.
"
19,5,Butters,"PC Principal, ah I don't think you quite realize how much negative stuff I have to sift through.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"I know it's a lot, but I just really need you to help these plus-sized models. And Vin Diesel.
"
19,5,Butters,"Vin Diesel too??
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Look bro! You've done an amazing job with Eric Cartman. You have really turned his life around, and other people deserve... to be as happy as he is.
"
19,5,Cartman,"Everyone likes me and thinks I'm great in my safe space.
"
19,5,Seagal,"My safe space.
"
19,5,Cartman,"People don't judge me and haters don't hate in my safe space? 
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Your safe space.
"
19,5,Cartman and Seagal,"Bully-proof windows, troll-safe doors, nothing but kindness and healing.
"
19,5,Randy,"You might call me a pussy, but I won't hear you in my safe space.
"
19,5,Seagal,"My safe space.
"
19,5,Cartman,"Bully-proof windows.
"
19,5,Demi Lovato,"If you do not like me, you are not allowed in my safe space.
"
19,5,Plus-sized models,"My safe space
"
19,5,PC Principal,"Look and you will see there's a very select crowd in your safe space. 
"
19,5,All,"My safe space.
"
19,5,Cartman,"People that support me.
"
19,5,All,"Mixed in with
"
19,5,Cartman,"More people that support me.
"
19,5,All,"And say nice things. Rainbows all around me, there is no shame in my safe space.
"
19,5,Randy,"My safe space.
"
19,5,Cartman,"Bully-proof windows. 
"
19,5,Reality,"I am going to tear down your safe space! Brick by brick, I shall smash it with glee!
"
19,5,Cartman,"What? Who is that?
"
19,5,Reality,"You cannot stop me from getting inside! I am cold and I am hard, and my name... is Reality.
"
19,5,Demi Lovato,"Oh no, not reality! Somebody stop him!
"
19,5,Cartman,"I'll take care of him, Demi! 
"
19,5,All,"You can't ruin our lives, Reality!
"
19,5,Cartman,"Our safe spaces will keep you out!
"
19,5,Reality,"Drat!
"
19,5,All,"We can face almost anything!
"
19,5,Cartman,"But Reality we can do without!
"
19,5,Reality,"Nooooo... 
"
19,5,Cartman,"Bully-proof windows.
"
19,5,All,"Troll-safe doors.
My Safe Space! 
"
19,5,Cartman,"That was nice.
"
19,5,Cashier,"All right, thanks, have a great day.  Good afternoon sir.
"
19,5,Randy,"Oh, hello. You might know Steven Seagal 
"
19,5,Steven Seagal,"Wanna play with me?
"
19,5,Randy,"And this is Vin Diesel.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Oh, hello gentlemen.
"
19,5,Randy,"It'd be... a really bad idea for you to charity-shame me today. These guys are here to protect my safe space.
"
19,5,Cashier,"That's great.  This little piggy went to market. This little piggy stayed home. This little piggy was in The Fast And The Furious , and this little piggy goes direct to cable.  And this little piggy just bought fifty-three dollars in beer and frozen pizzas. Would you like to make a dollar donation to hungry kids today?
"
19,5,Demi Lovato,"Look around you. What do you see? People who are slim. Skinny. But not everyone can afford to have nice bodies like them. Just imagine it. Putting your pictures up on Twitter just to have some people write comments about your weight. It happens, all too often.
"
19,5,Randy,"But it doesn't stop there. People also can be shamed for other traits viewed as negative. Make here was shamed for not being a good recycler.
"
19,5,Demi Lovato,"And so together, we have created #shamelessAmerica,  so no one is ever labeled...
"
19,5,Fat Woman,"Tubby.
"
19,5,Man with Cap,"Bad with tools.
"
19,5,Woman 2,"Dyke!
"
19,5,Man 2,"Butter butter dirty line cutter.
"
19,5,Randy,"Let's work together to create a completely shameless America.
"
19,5,Boy,"Because shaming hurts everyone. 
"
19,5,Cartman,"""Hey Demi Lovato, I bet your vagina has a-""  oh. Oh God. Oh, that's horrible  Augh.  Jeez. Delete. Delete that too. ""I'd like to stick my wiener into those fat rolls of-"" Oh God!  Uh, delete! ""You aren't fat, but my dick is-"" Whoa, God.
"
19,5,Reality,"HaHAA!
"
19,5,Butters,"GAAAHHH!
"
19,5,Reality,"So you're the one trying to destroy me, eh??
"
19,5,Butters,"What? 
"
19,5,Reality,"You little shit! Keep me out, will you?
"
19,5,Butters,"I don't know you, sir!
"
19,5,Reality,"You can't stop me!  I'm going to kill you! 
"
19,5,Stephen,"Butters! What are you doing!
"
19,5,Butters,"Well-ll the man! Uh, the man is gonna get me! 
"
19,5,Cashier,"And some chocolate-covered almonds. Vanderpump's Sangria mix.
"
19,5,Randy,"Yeah, um, I'm a little tired because I'm actually hosting a huge fundraiser for my charity organization  that I'm sort of the head of.
"
19,5,Cashier,"That's great, sir. Ice cream sandwiches.
"
19,5,Randy,"Yeah, we're gonna raise a lot of money. Celebrities are coming. Demi Lovato is givin' a hundred thousand for the event.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Wonderful. Rotisserie chicken. Oh yep, gotta have that Frank's hot sauce.
"
19,5,Randy,"I just thought, you know, a fundraiser dinner was sort of the appropriate place to ask for donations.
"
19,5,Cashier,"That's great, sir. Okay, your total is $37.85, and would you like to give a dollar to help put a hamster through college?
"
19,5,Randy,"...What? Did you not hear anything I said? I'm - I'm doin' all this stuff.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Not a problem, sir.  If you could just press the N0 button and tell the little hamster he's not going to college. Just look him right in the eye, sir, and say ""Not today, buddy.""
"
19,5,Randy,"Actually, my big fundraising gala is helping put hamsters through college too.
"
19,5,Cashier,"Oh, really? Wow. Did you hear that, Banjo? You've got support.  Well, you have a nice day sir.  And thank so much for being so generous.
"
19,5,Randy,"You're welcome. 
"
19,5,Cartman,"Hey Kyle. You wanna see what people said about my dick pic? Everyone's pretty stoked on it.
"
19,5,Kyle,"There's more than two people on the Internet.
"
19,5,Butters,"The man! The man the man the man the man!  The man he's gonna get me! He shadows me everywhere!  Do you see the man?!
"
19,5,Kyle,"Butters, what are you doing?! 
"
19,5,Butters,"Well he's gonna get me!
"
19,5,Kyle,"Dude, Butters, you're seeing things! Sifting through all the horrible stuff people say on the Internet is making you lose it!
"
19,5,Butters,"The world is darkness! The man is coming!
"
19,5,Stan,"Dude, Butters! 
"
19,5,Butters,"Aaaaa! Aaaaa!
"
19,5,Teacher,"And what color is the football the kittens are playing with?
"
19,5,Butters,"Run for your lives, you little fucks, the man is coming! 
"
19,5,Kyle,"Butters, listen to my voice.
"
19,5,Butters,"The man is gonna get me if I don't stop!
"
19,5,Kyle,"Then stop, dude! Butters, all this isn't worth it. Just. Take, the detention, dude.
"
19,5,Butters,"YEEAAAAAGGHH! 
"
19,5,Randy,"Alright everyone, thanks for coming to help raise money to stop shaming, and put hamsters through college.
"
19,5,Guest,"What'd he say?
"
19,5,Randy,"And now, a woman who knows about shaming firsthand, supermodel Gigi Hadid.
"
19,5,Gigi,"Alright, everyone enjoying themselves? How's that filet mignon?  You know, we're all here for a really important reason. Because everyone should-
"
19,5,Stephen,"Randy, Randy, we've got a problem.
"
19,5,Randy,"What?
"
19,5,Stephen,"Reality's here. He's trying to crash the party.
"
19,5,Randy,"Reality? Who let him in? Shit! 
"
19,5,Reality,"Woo, nice wine, huh? What do you think of that?  You know what I think of your pretty flowers?  There you go. How do you like that? 
"
19,5,Randy,"Alright buddy, let's go.
"
19,5,Reality,"I shit on all of you!
"
19,5,Randy,"Seagal?! 
"
19,5,Reality,"Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!  Give me that, you stupid bitch!  What a lovely charity event. I suppose you're all feeling pretty good about yourselves, hm? What have you done? You've raised $300 by spending half a million on filet mignon and crystal glasses.  Look at you, Vin Dipshit. You think fat-shaming is wrong, so in response you show off your abs. You're the one fat-shaming, idiot! What's the matter with you people?! You're saaad that people are meeean? Well I'm sorry, the world isn't one big liberal arts college campus! We eat too much; we take our spoiled lives for granted, feel a little bad about it sometimes! No, you wanna put up all your shit on the Internet and have every single person say ""Hooray for you!"" Fuck you. You're all pricks. And I've got news for you! While you've all been sitting here trying to feel good, the little boy who sucked all your shit is about to die from it!
"
19,5,Seagal,"What?
"
19,5,Demi Lovato,"Oh my God. What have we done?
"
19,5,Seagal,"Jesus, I d-I didn't even think.
"
19,5,PC Principal,"I guess... I asked too much of one kid.
"
19,5,Randy,"Listen, everybody.  I think there's a way to try and make this right for everyone.
"
19,5,Randy,"To date, Shameless America has raised over $40,000. With that money, we are putting more and more iPads into these people's hands.  With iPads, these people can finally help more Americans get rid of negativity on their social media.  Oh, thanks Jojo. I'm shame-free now, and you can be too. For just $1 a day, one of these beautiful children will protect you from trolls and make your Internet a safe space. We won't rest until America is completely shameless. The world can be brutal, but Shameless America is going to continue to take steps to amke sure everyone has a safe space... forever.
"
19,5,Butters,"Are you sure this is a good idea?
"
19,5,Randy,"Uh huh. 
"
19,6,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up.  Today we're going to be showing you some art from our Asian-American students-DAMMIT LESLIE, SHUT YOUR FUCKING PIE-HOLE!  -from our Asian-American students presented by our student-body president, Wendy Testaburger.
"
19,6,Wendy,"Hey guys. As you know, we have several new students here at South Park Elementary. We have been getting to know some of the Asian girls who have introduced us to an art style called ""yaoi.""  Yaoi is a blend of emotion and beauty involving two people whose love is looked down upon. The art tries to show that all love is magical, like in Lisa Akimoto's piece, ""Tweek and Craig - Forbidden Love."" 
"
19,6,Girls,"Awwww.
"
19,6,Tweek,"What?
"
19,6,Wendy,"Kelly Zhou goes a bit more whimsical with ""Craig and Tweek: Moonlight Dance."" 
"
19,6,Girls,"Awwww.
"
19,6,Craig,"Dude, what the fuck?
"
19,6,Wendy,"In yaoi art, the seme, or top, is usually dominating the uke, or bottom, as demonstrated in Heather Nishimura's ""Boizu Rabu."" 
"
19,6,Girls,"Awwww. 
"
19,6,Wendy,"But yaoi can branch out to other things as well.
"
19,6,Cartman,"Uh oh.
"
19,6,Wendy,"As we see here in ""Lily, Frog, Tweek and Craig."" 
"
19,6,Stan,"I just don't get it. I mean, Tweek and Craig aren't gay. Right?
"
19,6,Kyle,"No. We would know.
"
19,6,Butters,"Well, but then why would Asian girls draw them like that?
"
19,6,Jimmy,"Yeah, what is this yaoi thing all about? I am so c-c-c-confused.
"
19,6,Stan,"And if it can happen to Tweek and Craig... could it happen to any of us?
"
19,6,Craig,"Uhh, excuse me, why are you doing this?? 
"
19,6,Girl 1,"""Oh, hi, Craig. 오늘 다른 셔츠 입었네.""(He's wearing a different shirt today.) 
"
19,6,Craig,"What? Well what did she say?
"
19,6,Girl 3,"I don't know, that was Korean. I'm Japanese.
"
19,6,Tweek,"What is going on, huh? Huh? Me and him aren't together. Why is this happening?!  Everyone thinks I'm gay! What if my parents find out! Huh!
"
19,6,PC Principal,"Alright guys, I know there have been a lot of rumors flyin' around. Just wanted to check in, see if you have any questions for me.
"
19,6,Craig,"Why are the Asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay?
"
19,6,PC Principal,"What's wrong with being gay? Nothin' wrong with that.
"
19,6,Craig,"But we aren't! I'm not!
"
19,6,Tweek,"I'm not either!
"
19,6,PC Principal,"That is completely irrelevant! Okay? What matters, and the reason I brought you in here, is that you understand affirmative consent.
"
19,6,Tweek,"What's that?
"
19,6,PC Principal,"If there is a romantic relationship here, you have to make sure your partner is comfortable with any sexual exploration.
"
19,6,Tweek,"Gah!
"
19,6,PC Principal,"Now, in a gay relationship it gets a little trickier, but you still have to follow some guidelines, alright?
"
19,6,Craig,"But I'm not gay!
"
19,6,PC Principal,"I don't care about that, bro! Tweek, if, and I'm only saying if, at some point you wanted to tough Craig's penis, you just can't go grabbin' for it. Alright? You need to say something like ""Craig, is it alright with you if I touch your penis?"" Okay? Let's try it out.
"
19,6,Tweek,"NO!
"
19,6,PC Principal,"You want two weeks' detention instead?! This shit's important!
"
19,6,Tweek,"Craig, can I touch your penis?
"
19,6,PC Principal,"Okay, good. Now Craig, you might say ""You may touch my penis. I'm comfortable with that.""  Or of course, you could say ""No, you may not touch my penis at this time.""
"
19,6,Craig,"No you may not!
"
19,6,PC Principal,"Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Now Craig, what should you say if you wanted to take a gander at Tweek's asshole?
"
19,6,Sharon,"Randy, you should have a talk with Stan.
"
19,6,Randy,"For what?
"
19,6,Sharon,"I guess something happened at school today involving two of Stan's friends? Being gay?
"
19,6,Randy,"What?
"
19,6,Sharon,"Yeah. Stan seems really perplexed.
"
19,6,Randy,"Wow. Our town has only had a Whole Foods for three weeks and we already have our first gay kids. So cool. 
"
19,6,Sharon,"Go talk to him, Randy, and be delicate.
"
19,6,Randy,"Hey bud. How's it hangin'? 
"
19,6,Stan,"I'm confused, Dad. There was this thing at school.
"
19,6,Randy,"Well, guess what? You're got a really progressive PC dad who knows all about this stuff, okay? Go ahead, ask me anything.
"
19,6,Stan,"I just don't understand how it's decided.
"
19,6,Randy,"Ah, well, you see, it's a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.
"
19,6,Stan,"No, I mean like, what makes the Asians decide who they're gonna make gay?
"
19,6,Randy,"The Asian? The Asians decide who's going to be gay? Uh are y-, yeah, yeah they do. Uh, the Asians just, you know, the Asians pick who they pick, and um, it's al- it's, the way it's always been.
"
19,6,Stan,"So you've heard of yaoi?
"
19,6,Randy,"Yeah, of course. Yaoi, anal intercourse, Maui Zaui, I, I know all this stuff, Stan.
"
19,6,Gerald,"Oh hey, Thomas! Hey, we heard about Craig. We think it's just terrific.
"
19,6,Thomas,"What about Craig? 
"
19,6,Stephen,"Thomas! I'm so glad that Craig is finally happy. Hey, it's Craig's dad, everybody. 
"
19,6,Richard,"Tweek's out of coffee, honey.
"
19,6,Mrs. Tweek,"Oh, here you go, kiddo. 
"
19,6,Richard,"Tweek, is there anything you want to talk to us about?
"
19,6,Tweek,"No.
"
19,6,Richard,"Well, we heard that you're gay. And I want you to know we've never been so proud of you.
"
19,6,Tweek,"Oh God. 
"
19,6,Richard,"We thought you were just a spaz, but to know that you've got so much going on inside.
"
19,6,Mom,"We're so proud of you, Tweek.
"
19,6,Tweek,"AAaaagh!
"
19,6,Richard,"Knowing what I know now, I'm gonna be a much better dad to you. In fact, I just, I just want to give you some money, Tweek.  Can I give you some money? Here, I I love you so much, son. 
"
19,6,Cartman,"Dude, Tweek and Craig. It's just so weird. If they've been gay this whole time, have they been checking me out? I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener. Should I kick his ass?
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Aw come on. What's wrong with two guys liking each other?
"
19,6,Cartman,"I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude?
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"But if love is love, then it takes form in all shapes and sizes. Teehee.
"
19,6,Cartman,"I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Really? Can I?
"
19,6,Cartman,"Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Oh thank you! I won't! 
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"You just needs a little spark of magic.  And now I'm gonna pee in your mouth.  Love is in the air. 
"
19,6,Cartman,"Did you do it, Cupid-Me?
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"I hit him with my love arrow, and then I peed in his mouth just for fun.
"
19,6,Cartman,"! That's awesome!! That's so sweet.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"I thought you might like that.
"
19,6,Cartman,"Yeah, dude. You're hilarious.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"And do you think I'm cute, too? 'Cause I think you're kind of cute.
"
19,6,Cartman,"Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I'm not homosexual, okay? It's not funny.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Oh well, at least Tweek and Craig are in love now. 
"
19,6,Cartman,"Yep. School tomorrow should be very interesting.
"
19,6,Stan,"And so my dad talked to me about it.
"
19,6,Kyle,"Yeah?
"
19,6,Stan,"And my dad said that Asians have always done this, and they, like, do make people gay.
"
19,6,Cartman,"You guys! You guys, hurry!
"
19,6,Kyle,"What?
"
19,6,Cartman,"It's, It's Tweek and Craig, dude! They're about to have sex! 
"
19,6,Craig,"Got a fuckin' problem man?! 
"
19,6,Tweek,"You're the one with the fuckin' problem! 
"
19,6,Craig,"I told you to stay a hundred yards from me!
"
19,6,Tweek,"You'd better not fuckin' push me again, man!
"
19,6,Cartman,"Oh come on, you guys. Get a room. 
"
19,6,PC Principal,"Hello Mr. Tucker. I need to inform you that your son was in an altercation at school today.
"
19,6,Thomas,"Craig? Craig got in a fight? 
"
19,6,PC Principal,"Yes, with his boyfriend. Just a lovers' quarrel, probably.
"
19,6,Craig,"Goddammit!
"
19,6,PC Principal,"Something to be expected in relationships. Apparently there were no affirmative consent issues, as your son knows the right way to play with another boy's penis.
"
19,6,Thomas,"Oh God...! 
"
19,6,PC Principal,"There's not gonna be any disciplinary action since they are gay. We wanna be supportive, so we're just gonna send them on home with some money, alright? Alright, you have a nice day.
"
19,6,Thomas,"Money?
"
19,6,Xi Jinping,"Wei? Ni hao (Hello? Who is there?)
"
19,6,Randy,"Uh, hi, Mr. Jinping. Thanks for taking my call, I was... just wondering if you could shed some light on how your people decide who will be gay and who will be straight.
"
19,6,Xi Jinping,"What?
"
19,6,Randy,"I'm sorry, I-I don't speak Asian, but... um, oh uh, oh, y-yao, yaoi. Yaoi, yes? Boizu rabu. Huh, how does that work?
"
19,6,Xi Jinping,"That-a come from-a Japan.
"
19,6,Randy,"Oh, it's Japan that decides?  How the hell do they actually make people geh-?  Aaaa-a-ah, Japan. Of course, is who does the yaoi to make people gay.
"
19,6,Xi Jinping,"They are dogs!  who refused, and not apologized, to the Chinese republic!
"
19,6,Randy,"Uh huh, yes, that of course I do already know about homosexuality.
"
19,6,Delivery Man,"Hi, flower delivery for Eric Cartman? 
"
19,6,Liane,"Oh my, how beautiful.  Oh look sweetie, someone sent you flowers.
"
19,6,Cartman,"""Can't we just try? Teehee."" Oh man.
"
19,6,Liane,"Who are they from, hon?
"
19,6,Cartman,"Someone who needs a real talking to.
"
19,6,Cartman,"Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee. Aw, come on, let's be like Tweek and Craig. Everyone thinks they're cool.
"
19,6,Cartman,"You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"But I'm so attracted to you.
"
19,6,Cartman,"I realize that, but I'm sorry. I need you to stop bothering me.  This... is done. I'm just not a homosexual. 
"
19,6,Richard,"Well, hello Craig. Honey, it's Craig.
"
19,6,Mom,"Awww, hi Craig.
"
19,6,Craig,"Is Tweek home?
"
19,6,Richard,"He sure is. Come on in.  Would you like to have some coffee, Craig?
"
19,6,Craig,"No thank you, I just want to see Tweek.
"
19,6,Mom,"Awww.
"
19,6,Richard,"Tweek's just up in his room playing. You can go on up.  Oh, uh, but keep the door open, alright?  They're so gay.
"
19,6,Craig,"Hey dude. 
"
19,6,Tweek,"No, no! What are you doing here? 
"
19,6,Craig,"Tweek, calm down. We have to put a stop to this.
"
19,6,Tweek,"There's no stopping it! The whole world wants me to be something I'm not!
"
19,6,Craig,"Me too, dude. But there's something we can do.
"
19,6,Tweek,"What??
"
19,6,Craig,"We have to come out and say we're gay.
"
19,6,Tweek,"What?! Are you insane?! The way everyone-!
"
19,6,Craig,"Wait. Wait! Because if we're gay, we can break up. And if we break up, no more pictures. We just have to stage a fake breakup in front of the Asian girls.
"
19,6,Tweek,"Like acting? No man, that is way too much pressure! I'll fail-
"
19,6,Craig,"You can do it, Tweek! You're capable of more than you think.
"
19,6,Tweek,"Agh. I'm a terrible actor.
"
19,6,Craig,"You just follow my lead, and try and make it believable, okay?
"
19,6,Tweek,"Oh gah-okay.
"
19,6,Thomas,"What did I do wrong, huh? Everyone's so damned happy, but... but why did this have to happen to my son?! What did I do to make my son like this?
"
19,6,Randy,"Hey, hey, whoa, you didn't do anything.
"
19,6,Thomas,"Oh what? You know about this?
Randy: Yeah, let me handle this guys, I'm PC. Look Thomas, you need to understand that being gay isn't a decision. You know, a lot of people think that Asians decide who's gay and who's not. But it isn't all Asians, it's just specifically the Japanese, okay?
"
19,6,Thomas,"What?
"
19,6,Randy,"Why do the Japanese make some people gay and others not?  Well, it all goes back to World War II, and atrocities that happened in China called the Rape of Don King.
"
19,6,Skeeter,"Hey, you sure know a lot about this.
"
19,6,Randy,"Yes I do.
"
19,6,Kyle,"No dude, I looked it up. Yaoi is just an art style for girls by girls because they like fictionalizing two guys in a relationship.
"
19,6,Stan,"But why?
"
19,6,Kyle,"I don't know. But the point is, there's nothing about it that means Tweek and Craig are actually gay, at all.
"
19,6,Craig,"Hey Tweek! Hold up. Listen, it's just not going to work. 
"
19,6,Tweek,"What? Why not? 
"
19,6,Craig,"I'm sorry Tweek, but we can't lie to ourselves anymore.  Yes, we are gay, but we do not belong together.
"
19,6,Tweek,"We don't belong together? What suddenly changed, Craig?
"
19,6,Craig,"It's just that people are different. That's all.
"
19,6,Tweek,"Uh huh. And who the hell is Michael?! Huh?! You wanna tell me that?! 
"
19,6,Craig,"What? What are you, what are you talking about?
"
19,6,Tweek,"I went through your phone when we went out last night, Craig! I saw your texts to Michael about hooking up with him!
"
19,6,Craig,"Wait, uh, that's, that's not what happened.
"
19,6,Tweek,"Oh, it's not?
"
19,6,Craig,"No.  Uh look, we both know this is for the better.
"
19,6,Tweek,"Oh, don't use that lame shit on me, man! You don't wanna feel bad, so you're tryiing to tell me what I want?
"
19,6,Craig,"Wait, don't make me out to be the bad guy here.
"
19,6,Tweek,"Noho, you're not the bad guy! You're never the bad guy, are you?! You, you just step on people and you use them!
"
19,6,Craig,"You're going too far, dude. This is like, totally not necessary.
"
19,6,Tweek,"Agh-I'm going too far?! What is wrong with you?
"
19,6,Craig,"This wasn't part of the plan!
"
19,6,Tweek,"Well guess what, Craig! Love doesn't follow a plan!
"
19,6,Butters,"Yeah!
"
19,6,Tweek,"I was totally wrong about you. I opened myself up and let you in. But you've got spikes, man. You've got spikes. 
"
19,6,Wendy,"Tweek. 
"
19,6,Craig,"Dude, seriously? Seriously?
"
19,6,Mrs. Tucker,"They... they broke up? 
"
19,6,Cartman,"What are you doing? This place isn't you. 
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"I'm just here to pick up on guys. Why? are you jealous?
"
19,6,Cartman,"No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Oh, now you need me, huh? Fuck you, dude.
"
19,6,Cartman,"Fuck you.
"
19,6,Man 1,"What is that kid doing here?
"
19,6,Man 2,"He's just kind of talking to himself.
"
19,6,Cartman,"The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Well, I guess I could try now, in return for just... one date?
"
19,6,Cartman,"I'm not homosexual!
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Then I guess I'm not interested.
"
19,6,Cartman,"Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee! Teeheeheeheehee!
"
19,6,Bartender,"Hey kid, what do you think you're doing here?
"
19,6,Cartman,"Oh, hey, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa. I'm not here for me, I'm here for my friend, okay? 
"
19,6,Tweek,"Hi, is Craig here, sir?
"
19,6,Thomas,"Why can't you quit him? 
"
19,6,Mrs. Tucker,"Thomas!
"
19,6,Thomas,"Five minutes. He's in the back. 
"
19,6,Tweek,"Hey dude.
"
19,6,Craig,"What do you want?
"
19,6,Tweek,"I thought when we broke up everything would get better. I was thinking maybe, we should say we're back together.
"
19,6,Craig,"Dude, I'm not gay and neither are you!
"
19,6,Tweek,"What does that have to do with anything?
"
19,6,Craig,"You think you can just pull that shit you pulled at school, saying I step on people and use them?! And I'll just take you back?
"
19,6,Tweek,"You said to make it seem real.
"
19,6,Craig,"Not that real! Now everyone thinks I'm a manipulative cheater! I'll never get any chicks!
"
19,6,Tweek,"I'm so sorry, Craig. You, you made me believe in myself in a way I never have before. I didn't think I had any of that in me, but... you were right. I can do more than I think. You... changed something in me and I just... I wanna fix whatever's hurting you now. 
"
19,6,Craig,"I can't be something because everyone wants me to be. I have to be myself. You'll just have to go be gay with someone else.
"
19,6,Tweek,"Alright Craig. Alright. 
"
19,6,Thomas,"I can see how much they're both hurting, but... Can't you understand that in my time we just didn't accept this? rests his head on his left hand
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"You guys need a little prick of magic.  And I'll pee in your mouth a little bit. 
"
19,6,Thomas,"Then again, he's my son no matter what. I can't just shut down on him.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee, teeheeheehee. 
"
19,6,Thomas,"Son, you need to listen to me.  You can't fight being gay. I used to think that being gay was a choice, but, you don't get to decide. Japan picks who they pick, and that's that. I don't understand this stuff. Heck, I didn't even know Don King got raped, but... I do know that if you try and resist it, you make yourself miserable your whole life. Everyone was so proud of you, Ah I was just being selfish. I wanna be proud of you too. I like gay Craig. I love you. Here's a hundred dollars. 
"
19,6,Japanese singer,"Maybe we should go away.
Put cares aside for just a day.
"
19,6,Japanese singer,"The world we face is a-not so big.
Not if we are strong like Tweek and Craig.
Honto ni sekanda ga oichii
Let's go back to when it was new.
"
19,6,Japanese singer,"Weren't we such happy people too?
Life was simple, problems vague. 
We had it all, a lot like Tweek and Craig.
"
19,6,Japanese singer,"And in the darkness we all seek
A perfect love like Craig and Tweek.
We must fight or love's a goner.
We must hold Tweek and Craig with the
Highest honor!  Gambaro Irashai!
I hope you know when you are down 
That you turned my life around. 
Just like the quote from Shakespeare said
I'm your Tweek,  and you're my Craig.
"
19,6,Cartman,"Okay, okay, the date's almost over.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee. Aren't you liking your massage?
"
19,6,Cartman,"It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me.
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Well, I've got something you might like a little better. 
"
19,6,Cartman,"Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight!
"
19,6,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee!
"
19,6,Cartman,"Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God!  Oh Cupid Me, that's enough! Okay, that's it, Cupid Me! That's it!  That's it, Cupid Me. Okay, that's it. That's it, Cupid Me. 
"
19,6,Liane,"Awww.
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"Attention all units in the vicinity of South Park Elementary!  We have a code red!  Principal calling for help during school assembly! All officers needed at once!
"
19,7,Officer Barbrady,"The school?  Oh Jeez Louise! 
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"We need to get to the gym! Half go this way, half go around the side! Barbrady, you go around back! 
"
19,7,Officer 1,"On 3 1... 2... 
"
19,7,PC Principal,"There she is, officers, right there. I told you to stop chatting with your friend, didn't I, Leslie? You  see, officers, apparently Leslie thinks that talking to her friends is more important than learning about diversity in third-world countries.  That one. Right there. You remove her from my school.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Whoa! Nobody move! What's happening?
"
19,7,PC Principal,"Get her out of here! 
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Oh, they've got me! 
"
19,7,Boy,"AAAAAH!
"
19,7,PC Principal,"Waaaah!
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"This town is outraged, Officer Barbrady! People are tired of the police not being held accountable for their actions!
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Mayor, I didn't know if there was a gunman, or a bomb-
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"You shot an unarmed six year old Latino child!
"
19,7,Barbrady,"I'm sorry.
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"You're fired.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"No, Mayor, please. This is all I know. I used to be the only policeman in this town, remember? Bob, ah I used to chase away the sixth graders for you.
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"You're from another time, Barbrady. And the last thing that needs to go. Your gun and your badge.  And your sunglasses.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"No, please, not my sunglasses.
"
19,7,Johnson,"You're done, Barbrady! The town doesn't want you here! 
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Where should I go?
"
19,7,Johnson,"You should have thought of that before you shot a Mexican!
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Latino-American.
"
19,7,Johnson,"Latino-American.  Shit.
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"You should go away. You don't belong anywhere in a town as progressive as this one.
"
19,7,Homeless Man 1,"Aaay, quiet down over there, I'm trying to sleep
"
19,7,Stuart,"Goddammit! You people all get out of here!
"
19,7,Homeless Man 2,"What made you in charge? 
"
19,7,Stuart,"'Cause this is my fuckin' house!
"
19,7,Homeless Man 3,"Hey beat it, man, or I'll make you my bitch! 
"
19,7,Stuart,"Yeah, we've got a bunch of drunk-addict vagrants trespassing on our yard and we need assistance.
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"Oh, is that so? Well, we'd like to come help you, but we don't wanna get fired.
"
19,7,Stuart,"What are you talkin' about? There's homeless people here and they're scarin' my kids! You need to come do somethin' about this!
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"I see. And are any of these homeless people of a minority persuasion?
"
19,7,Stuart,"Well why does that matter?
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"Oh, it matters. See, it used be we could beat up minorities and nobody cared. It's the reason a lot of us joined the force.  Hey Mitch, you wanna go down and arrest some homeless people but not be able to beat up any minorities?
"
19,7,Mitch,"No thank you.
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"Yeah, no, I think we're good. In fact, we're thinking of maybe turning the whole department into a hula school. Whattaya think?
"
19,7,Stuart,"God Dammit! 
"
19,7,Mrs. McCormick,"What are they doing?
"
19,7,Stuart,"They're not coming!
"
19,7,Mrs. McCormick,"But they have to! Karen brought in one of their syringes, for Christ's sake!
"
19,7,Stuart,"Well that's just too bad! The cops won't come, so there's nobody to scare the homeless away!
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Hi, sweetheart. I've uh... I've been let go from the force. I'm so sorry.  Don't worry, old girl.  It might be a little tough to afford your medication, but I'll find a way. You know me. I like to help. I like to be needed.
"
19,7,Cartman,"You guys! Oh my God you guys! You guys, they're gay!  They're totally gay!
"
19,7,Stan,"Who?
"
19,7,Cartman,"Kenny and Token.
"
19,7,Kyle,"What?
"
19,7,Cartman,"Kenny and Token, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me.
"
19,7,Kyle,"You're lying.
"
19,7,Cartman,"No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away.
"
19,7,Kyle,"How is that gay?
"
19,7,Cartman,"It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!
"
19,7,Butters,"Over this way! 
"
19,7,Token,"We will defend our ninja honor!  Intruders! Protect the base!  Hey guys, did you come to see our ninja fortress?
"
19,7,Cartman,"Oh my God they're so gay you guys.
"
19,7,Stan,"You and Kenny built all this?
"
19,7,Token,"Yeah, with Clyde and Davíd too. 
"
19,7,Clyde,"You guys should come and check it out.
"
19,7,Cartman,"Ah, no, we're good, thanks.  Oh my God this is a sausage party!
Clyde:	It's pretty cool, dude. People are scared of us.
"
19,7,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm sure they are. 
"
19,7,Driver,"Hey, excuse me, man, do you know where-?  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAH! Look! AAAAH!
"
19,7,Passenger,"Go, go, go! 
"
19,7,Cartman,"That's pretty cool.
"
19,7,Gerald,"Well the way I heard it was that the girl in the school wasn't even doing anything. Just talking too loud. And someone ends up getting shot.
"
19,7,Skeeter,"Hey! What you want?
"
19,7,Barkley,"'Sokay, I'm off duty. Just came in for a nice pinot.
"
19,7,Patron,"Yeah? Well go somewhere else, copper! ShiTpaTown is for people who care about each other!
"
19,7,Skeeter,"We don't take kindly to folks who impose their authority on the underprivileged!
"
19,7,Barkley,"Now look, not all cops are racist trigger-happy assholes.
"
19,7,Randy,"Really? I'll bet you don't even know what ""farm to table"" means. 
"
19,7,Randy,"Wow. We've only had a Whole Foods for a month and already we don't need cops. So cool. 
"
19,7,Token,"It is a great honor to see that you all want to be ninjas. Joining our club is very serious. You must promise to uphold the warrior's code. 
"
19,7,Cartman,"Totally dude, ninjas are sweet.
"
19,7,Token,"Together we must strive to make our fortress super bad-ass and keep all intruders out! To that end, let us proceed to our training.
"
19,7,Cartman,"Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He's probably gonna try and turn it around on me, but that's 'cause Kyle knows I heard him.
"
19,7,Kyle,"You're talking to Kyle right now.
"
19,7,Cartman,"Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters.
"
19,7,Kyle,"You're the one who said ninjas were gay. Why do you wanna make this a problem?
"
19,7,Cartman,"I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things.
"
19,7,Butters,"Hey Eric, you wanna try sparring with me?
"
19,7,Cartman,"Yes I do, Butters. 
"
19,7,Butters,"OOF. Ow. Ahem.
"
19,7,Clyde,"Intruders! 
"
19,7,Homeless Man 4,"Yeah, it's right up here. We can shoot up in these abandoned buildings. 
"
19,7,Anchor,"The town of South Park is holding a large protest tonight outside of their police department. The townspeople say the protest is meant to begin a dialog about the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens they are supposed to protect.
"
19,7,Anchor,"Are your children being lured into terrorist organizations? A shocking report shows that some kids in the town of South Park are swearing loyalty to a murderous regime.
"
19,7,Cartman,"Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool.
"
19,7,Reporter,"And what about this way of life has attracted you?
"
19,7,Butters,"We're just cool 'cause we're tough, and we fight and stuff, and we can ah-.
"
19,7,Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad!
"
19,7,Stan,"Then why'd you say it was gay before?
"
19,7,Cartman,"Oh my God! I never said it was gay!
"
19,7,Token,"Wait, he said this was gay?
"
19,7,Cartman,"That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way Tweek and Craig make love?!  He's a lying, backstabbing Jew!
"
19,7,Stan,"I'm Stan.
"
19,7,Anchor,"No doubt the growing number of kids swearing loyalty to ISIS could be problematic for the progressive town.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Here you go, old girl. We'll just have to make do. 
"
19,7,Randy,"Ew. 
"
19,7,Homeless Man 5,"Spare a dollar?
"
19,7,Randy,"No I don't I'm sorry thank you Goddammit ew.  Mayor, I didn't bust my ass to gentrify this part of town to have it overrun with homeless people!
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Why are they all suddenly coming here?
"
19,7,Gerald,"Mayor, what are you going to do about this? My wife and I can barely eat or shop.
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"When a town like ours has a homeless problem it must look at the root of what's causing it.
"
19,7,Stephen,"It's ISIS!
"
19,7,Randy,"What?
"
19,7,Stephen,"They're these troubled kids who've turned their backs on America! They've taken over SoDoSoPa, forced all the homeless out!
"
19,7,Gerald,"Why would kids in our town wanna be a part of that?
"
19,7,Stephen,"They're just bad kids! Rotten on the inside! Probably with shitty parents!
"
19,7,Ryan,"Son, I've always tried to be a fair dad. Eh I I don't want to meh make you angry, but... why?
"
19,7,Jimmy,"Well Dad, I just re-really like being a part of something. I feel like it's character-building and it's lots of fun.
"
19,7,Ryan,"Fun? But what do you... believe in?
"
19,7,Jimmy,"What do we believe in? We believe in something greater than ourselves, and that by following our strict warrior code we believe that our faiths and our traditions are a way to a greater path - the p-p-p-path of the warrior. And as long as we stay united in honor we can defeat all our enemies.  Wow, the fellas were right. People are really freaked out by ninjas.
"
19,7,Randy,"Okay, we've just gotta be really apologetic and tell them we didn't mean it, okay?
"
19,7,Gerald,"Jeez, this is so embarrassing.
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"What if they won't help us with the homeless?
"
19,7,Stephen,"I'm pretty sure the police will help out if it's because ISIS is taking over the town. 
"
19,7,Stephen,"Officers, there's kids in town who have joined ISIS. We don't know who they are, but they-.
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"What? What's that, you say?
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"The town is in danger, alright? We don't know what these kids are capable of.
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"Jeez, I'm sorry. We've got to work on our koholo kaloa, and get the lomi lomi chicken ready for the big ho'olao le'ao, which leaves us... oh, not enough time to deal with ISIS.
"
19,7,Randy,"Alright, look. There's homeless people all over our gentrified food and arts district. If you don't stop thewe twisted kids, then-
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"Hey, who was it that said ""fuck the police""? Was that Ice Cube? Tupac? Oh, right, that was you guys! Sorry, but I guess you'll have to find somebody else to do all the difficult dirty shit you don't want to do yourselves. I've gotta be ready for the luau. I might even kiss a dude.
"
19,7,Cartman,"So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember?
"
19,7,Butters,"Yeah?
"
19,7,Cartman,"And we said Kenny and Token were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember?
"
19,7,Butters,"Uh I thought you said it first.
"
19,7,Cartman,"No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Buttters.
"
19,7,Token,"You guys! You guys!
"
19,7,Stan,"What?
"
19,7,Token,"Actual Ninjas. Wanna talk to us.
"
19,7,Clyde,"What?
"
19,7,Token,"Kenny and I both just got the same email from people overseas.
"
19,7,Cartman,"Whoa, dude.
"
19,7,Stan,"How's they found out who we were?
"
19,7,Cartman,"They're fuckin' ninjas, dude!
"
19,7,ISIS Leader,"So, you are the brave children who have committed to our cause. We are aware of what you are doing and we are very impressed.
"
19,7,Stan,"Cool. Thanks, dude.
"
19,7,ISIS Leader,"What you are doing is very important and we would like to help you however we can. We are going to be wiring you some money.
"
19,7,Butters,"Whoa, cool! Why, this is the greatest thing ever you guys!
"
19,7,Cartman,"Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something?
"
19,7,ISIS Leader,"Of course.
"
19,7,Cartman,"Should Jews be trusted?  Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that as being at all problematic?
"
19,7,ISIS Leader,"Extremely.
"
19,7,Cartman,"YES!  YEEES!  Oh--oh, oh--oh! Oh--oh, oh--oh! What did I tell you guys?
"
19,7,Randy,"Hey Barbrady.  Officer Barbrady.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Uh, who?
"
19,7,Randy,"Hey buddy. 
"
19,7,Barbrady,"What do you want?
"
19,7,Johnson,"How would you like to be a policeman again?
"
19,7,Barbrady,"I'm no good as a policeman. I'm a bumbling old fool.
"
19,7,Stephen,"That is not true! Who said that? Look, Barbrady, the fact is, the town needs you.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"They need me? To do what?
"
19,7,Randy,"We need you to shoot some kids. 
"
19,7,Barbrady,"No! Shoot kids? I don't wanna shoot kids!
"
19,7,Randy,"Shh! Shhh! Shhhh! These are really bad kids. Terrorists. This is totally different from before.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"No. No. Are any of them minorities?
"
19,7,Aide,"A couple of them, we think. Yeah.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Noo no no no no no no no no!
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Sh, look, look look, Barbrady, Barbrady! We were wrong about you. I... was wrong about you. You... protected this town back before anybody else ever did. You used to do it all on your own. We need you to do that again. 
"
19,7,Randy,"You're the only cop this town needs, Barbrady. Go shoot those kids.
"
19,7,Cartman,"You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me a lot I didn't know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle's house to talk to him about it, and I found this.  It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization. And he almost got away with it. That's when Kyle tried to kill me. Luckily I was the faster ninja.  Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he's going to try and tell you that I'm lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar.
"
19,7,Kyle,"I'm right here. 
"
19,7,Cartman,"Who, who is this?
"
19,7,Stan,"That's Clyde.
"
19,7,Cartman,"...and I am Token. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Oh Jesus. ISIS, oh God.
"
19,7,Grandpa,"This chicken tastes like shit. What'd you do to it?
"
19,7,Randy,"Okay, okay Dad, it's not organic chicken. I'm not comfortable shopping at Whole Foods with all the homeless people there. But don't worry. That's all about to change. Soon we'll all have ShiTpaTown to enjoy again. Where's Stan?
"
19,7,Sharon,"He's playing ninjas over at Kenny's house.
"
19,7,Randy,"Ninjas? That's gay.  He's playing ninjas at Kenny's house?
"
19,7,Sharon,"Yeah.
"
19,7,Randy,"You mean, SoDoSoPa?
"
19,7,Sharon,"Uh huh.
"
19,7,Randy,"Wait a minute... Ninjas...  ...scary... gay... Scary. Gay. Scary gay scary gay.
"
19,7,Sharon,"Randy, what are you doing?
"
19,7,Randy,"Scary gay scary gay scary GAY.  Staaaan!! 
"
19,7,Cartman,"Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, bug Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle.
"
19,7,Kyle,"Nobody ever gave a shit, you fat pig!
"
19,7,Token,"All those in favor of Cartman being kicked out of our ninja club?
"
19,7,Ninjas,"Hai!
"
19,7,Cartman,"No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please!
"
19,7,Stan,"What shall we do with him? 
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Freeze! 
"
19,7,Kyle,"Oh shit!
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Please, I don't wanna shoot you.  Look, I, ....Aaahaah.
"
19,7,Ninjas,"Aaahaah. 
"
19,7,Barbrady,"I understand you feeling angry at this town. I'm getting pretty angry too. But we can't give up on it. Please boys, don't make it end violently.
"
19,7,Randy,"They're just stupid ninjas! 
"
19,7,Davíd,"Aaa!
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Aaahaahaaawe!
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"What were you thinking?! Boys innocently playing ninja and you pull your gun on them?
"
19,7,Aide,"Davíd Rodriguez was lucky to live!
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Everybody told me they were terrorists.
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"We thought they were. But if it turns out they aren't, as a policeman, you have to figure that out!
"
19,7,Barbrady,"But, you said you needed me to kill some kids.
"
19,7,Randy,"Oh, he's gonna lay this on us now. I said kill some kids, but I said it as a question, remember? I said ""Kill some kids?""
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"I'm sorry, but we just can't cover your ass on this one. There's going to be an investigation and ... you just don't have what it takes to be a policeman in today's times.
"
19,7,Johnson,"Do you even know what ""farm to table"" means? 
"
19,7,Barkley,"Let's go people, you can't stay here. Hou are being relocated.
"
19,7,Homeless Man 6,"Hey, you can't kick us out of here, man.
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"Oh no? I'm a cop.
"
19,7,Randy,"Thank you, officers.
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"We've got a deal, right?
"
19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes. 
"
19,7,Sgt. Yates,"Alright you, come on! 
"
19,7,Homeless Man 6,"Aaaah!
"
19,7,Homeless Man 7,"Please! You can't take me back to SoDoSoPa! ISIS is there!
"
19,7,Officer 2,"No, those were just ninjas. 
"
19,7,Homeless Man 7,"Ninjas? Oh, that's so gay.
"
19,7,Cartman,"I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin' gay but you didn't wanna listen, nooo!
"
19,7,Agent,"Officer Barbrady.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Yes?
"
19,7,Agent,"We've been watching you. And what we see is a man who truly wants to protect his town.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"You do?
"
19,7,Agent,"You've been in this town longer than almost anyone. Have you noticed... changes... lately?
"
19,7,Barbrady,"Yeah, a lot of changes.
"
19,7,Agent,"They aren't a coincidence, officer. They are all part of a plan to take down your beloved town and everyone in it.
"
19,7,Barbrady,"What?
"
19,7,Agent,"What do you know about a little girl named...  Leslie? 
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Who was it?! Somebody's about to get their asses kicked!  When I find out who did this!
"
19,8,Butters,"PC Principal is on the warpath! Run for your lives! 
"
19,8,Stan,"Again?
"
19,8,Kyle,"Oh Jesus, now what?
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Who was it?! Huh?! Somebody better fess up RIGHT NOW! I'm gonna find out who did this!  Broflovski! Was it you?
"
19,8,Kyle,"Was what me, sir?
"
19,8,PC Principal,"I just saw a copy of the school newspaper in which a student used the word ""retarded"" to refer to our cafeteria lunch policy! The word ""retarded"" does not belong in our school!! Who is in charge of the school paper?! 'Cause I'm about to break their fuckin' legs!
"
19,8,Stan,"Aaah, he's in charge of the school paper.  You gonna break his legs, PC Principal?
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Alright, uhh, I I guess we haven't formally met before. Uhh, the reason I need to talk with you, Jason, is because of a very important-
"
19,8,Jimmy,"It's Jimmy, actually. My name is Jimmy, PC Principal.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Alright, Jim. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about the use of the R word in your school paper.  You see, the 'R' word is very bad.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Says who?
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Says me. Right? Now I know a thing or two about the rights of people with disabilities. When you use the 'R' word to describe the school's lunch policy, it can hurt people's hearts.  Can you understand that at all?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"That was an op-ed piece in the paper written by a first grader who found the school lunch policy to be ridiculous, and he thought ""r-retarded"" to be the best word to describe it. As the editor of the paper, I didn't think it was right to censor the words the student used.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"...Okay, well, from now on I'm gonna need to approve the school paper before you hand it out, okay?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"No.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"What'd you say?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"You're new here, so you don't understand how seriously I take my job as editor of the school paper. I don't allow ads, and I don't allow anything that might t-t-t-taint the truth behind what people are thinking. i don't want people to be afraid of words if it stops them from having a dialog.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Look, I don't wanna get angry, okay?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Why? Are you uncomfortable around people with disabilities? That's okay. Lot's of people are.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"No, I'm not. I am very not uncomfortable. Alright, look, unless I can approve your paper, it is not being distributed on campus, you got that?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"I can't hand out the school paper in school?
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Not unless it is approved by me. Do you understand?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Yep, got it.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Don't forget to read the school paper! Now delivered directly to your door.  Super School News! 
"
19,8,PC Bro 10,"What is that, bro? 
"
19,8,Jimmy,"S-s-s-suck my dick, PC Principal. 
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Who does this kid think he is?! Challenging me?! I said one micro-aggression to him, okay?! One little micro-aggression! But that doesn't mean I have an unconscious bias towards people with disabilities!
"
19,8,PC Bro 4,"No way, bro! That's wack!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"But why would a person with a disability not see that what I'm trying to do is actually protect them?
"
19,8,PC Bro 9,"Sometimes victims of oppression are so marginalized that they begin to sympathize with their oppressors.
"
19,8,PC Bro 11,"Yeah bro.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"You're right. This kid just needs to be shown he's being an Uncle Abel. I can always count on my PC frat brothers to have my back. Let's go PC!
"
19,8,PC Bros,"PC Woo!
"
19,8,Stephen,"Wow.  Wow, this is so great. Have you ever read the elementary school newspaper, Linda? There's no ads, no sponsored content, no links to click on. Just news stories about what's happening.  Did you know that the police in ShiTpaTown beat up homeless to clear them out?  Do you know long it's been since I was able to just sit back and read the news? I got so used to getting news off the Internet. But I feel like I'm always trying to chase the news somehow.  It's like I'm in a black void, trying to reach the news story.  But then the next thing I know I'm reading an ad for Geico. So I click out of that and try to read the news story but it's not a news story. It's a slide show.  And I'm looking at the worst celebrity plastic surgery jobs ever. So of course I want to see the next line of plastic surgery gone wrong, so I hit the arrow, but then the arrow wasn't the arrow for the next line, it was to take me to an ad for face cream. Haugh! I wanted to get a news story, but I'm reading about face cream and I try to click out of it, but the ad is following me, and it's following me all over the screen! Nooo! So I click on the close button, but it wasn't a close button, it was another slide show, and I just want to know what's happening in the Middle East, but instead, I'm looking at the top ten scariest movies of all time, and that's not the arrow for the next line, it's another ad! Aaagh!  But this... this is just news. And I don't get lost in all the bullshit. Linda?  Linda!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Alright Jim, I know you've been trying to wrap your head around some of the social issues he discussed yesterday. I'm sure you're feeling confused and a little unsure of yourself.
"
19,8,Nathan,"I'm not confused at all, actually, PC Principal.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Okay, well, no, you are confused-
"
19,8,Nathan,"I'm pretty sure that you're the one, but go ahead.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Because you don't grasp the severity of this, and that's why I brought in another young person with disabilities to share his feelings. Thanks for comin' in to talk to us, Nathan.
"
19,8,Nathan,"I like apples and bananas.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Me too, bro, me too. Nathan, could you tell Jimmy how you feel when people uwe the word ""retarded""?
"
19,8,Nathan,"It hurts my feelings because I feel bad.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Are you serious right now?
"
19,8,PC Principal,"You feel bad, right. You feel like that's a no-no word, right?
"
19,8,Nathan,"That word makes my heart piss its pants.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Okay, wow, that's pretty heavy. Pretty heavy, huh Jim?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Do you want to ask him what he means by that, or are you just pandering because you're uncomfortable around disabled people?
"
19,8,PC Principal,"I am not uncomfortable! I simply care about a horrible, outdated word that is exclusive, ignores individuality, and equates intellectual disa-bility with being... 
And it's, and it's, s-spot, I need a spotter, spot me, somebody spot me bro!
"
19,8,Topher,"And it's, it's part of a derogatory hate speech which fosters isolation and loneliness and being part of a voice to stop the R word is not only right, but extremely important!
"
19,8,Nathan,"I'm afraid of bears. 
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Hey Nathan, hold up. What were you doing in there?
"
19,8,Nathan,"What do you mean, Jimmy? Are you ma-ad?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Come on Nathan, you and I both know you use the word ""retarded"" 400 times a day.
"
19,8,Nathan,"Oh Jimmy. So righteous, aren't you? So blind to everything that's going on.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"What are you talking about?
"
19,8,Nathan,"Do you really think all the changes happening to this town are just coincidence? This goes so much deeper than you can possibly imagine, Jim. Everyone's about to learn the truth. And then... There's a war coming. A war, Jim. And I'm just gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it.
"
19,8,Mr. Mackey,"Come on, boys, let's get back to class.
"
19,8,Nathan,"I like to smell trees! 
"
19,8,Anchor Tom,"An elementary school newspaper is making big waves as more and more people say No to news on the Internet.
"
19,8,Rancher,"I read super school news 'cause it don't try and fool me and it's news reports aren't paid for by ad companies.
"
19,8,Gerald,"We just feel like this is actual news, and instead of clicking on links, we're reading stories.
"
19,8,Stephen,"I had to get away from the ads. I felt like the ads were... evolving somehow. They started knowing what I liked. What I was afraid of. I tried ad blockers, but it seemed like every time I tried to block the ads, they just got smarter. I'm never going back from Super School News.
"
19,8,Anchor Tom,"The young editor of the paper claims that since most people now watch news reports on the Internet, they're easily distracted or even fooled by ads,  which are finding more and more clever ways to disguise them-
"
19,8,Randy,"Oooo, brutal celebrity mugshots.  O-hoh it got me. Ad got me, Sharon.
"
19,8,Announcer,"We now return live to the 2015 Presidential Debate.
"
19,8,Moderator,"Our next question is for you, Mrs. Clinton. Many voters believe that Syrian refugees should not be allowed into our country for security reasons. What do you think?
"
19,8,Hillary,"Keeping our country save has become more and more difficult, but I believe there are several things that we can-
"
19,8,Mr. Garrison,"No! You shut the hell up! You've got a dumpy butt, and seven chins. Syrian refugees are all terrorists!
"
19,8,Hillary,"I know that our government needs to take a harder look at all-
"
19,8,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah well, it's pretty hard to look at you! We can all agree on that!
"
19,8,Caitlyn Jenner,"She looks like a donkey took a shit in her face. 
"
19,8,Mr. Garrison,"Yeh-hah, good one Caitlyn. See, what I know is that there's only one way to deal with Syrian refugees, and that is...
"
19,8,Everyone,"Fuck them all to death!
"
19,8,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you!!  That was hilarious when you called her a pizza face.
"
19,8,Caitlyn Jenner,"It's like a Papa John's pimple party.
"
19,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, that was classic, Caitlyn. You're the best running mate ever.
"
19,8,Principal Victoria,"Hello, Mr. Garrison.
"
19,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh My God... Principal Victoria?
"
19,8,Principal Victoria,"Congratulations on the polls. We need to talk. 
"
19,8,PC Bro 12,"Celebrate diversity! Woooo!
"
19,8,PC Bro 13,"GO PC!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up.  Tonight is a very special night for the PCs. We're honored to be throwing this event for people with disabilities.  I for one am sick of how these amazing kids are marginalized in today's society. but tonight is about learning and healing. So let's get to it! PC! 
"
19,8,PC Bro 7,"Hey guys, I'm Brad. I'm PC Arizona State.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Nice to meet you, Brad. Where do you guys-?
"
19,8,Brad,"Excuse me a second.  Hello, ladies. Thanks for coming to our event.
"
19,8,Ladies,"Hi.
"
19,8,Brad,"We're just tired with the way people with disabilities get treated. Can I get you some alcohol?
"
19,8,PC Bro 14,"Yah, you know, it just bugs me when people refer to persons with disabilities as ""handicapped."" When I hear that word I wanna fuckin' punch them in the fuckin' face.
"
19,8,Blonde,"That's so cool of you, wow.
"
19,8,PC Bro 14,"Yeah.  To me marginalizing persons with disabilities by asking them what their handicap is, is a micro-aggression no better than asking a person of color if they went to college.
"
19,8,Blonde,"Wow, you're really progressive.
"
19,8,PC Bro 14,"No other way to be. So uh, listen. I think you're really pretty and interesting, and I'd kinda like to take you upstairs and totally crush your pussy. Would that be acceptable to you?
"
19,8,Blonde,"Oh well, I, I guess it would.
"
19,8,PC Bro 14,"No, I'm sorry, I need affirmative consent. I'll need you to say ""Yes, you may take me upstairs and crush my pussy at this time."" 
"
19,8,PC Bros,"PC Bros, PC. Yeah!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"McKinsey, you got consent forms?
"
19,8,McKinsey,"Oh yeah, right here bro. 
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Rise and shine guys. If you scored last night, I'll need your consent forms.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you-whoa! Barker, did you perform cunnilingus? There's a different release form, bro.
"
19,8,PC Bro 15,"Yup. Uh, so-, sorry. It's right here.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Nice.
"
19,8,PC Bro 11,"Bro! Aw, dude, bro!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"What, bro?
"
19,8,PC Bro 11,"Dude, I scored with this female and after consenting to putting her mouth on my penis, she wanted me to walk her home.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Yeah?
"
19,8,PC Bro 11,"And when I got to her house she had me meet her father who is Filipino, so I asked him if he could tell me about their cultural and social dynamic to being a Filipino-American.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Naturally.
"
19,8,PC Bro 11,"So he said some stuff, and then the newspaper landed on his doorstep, 'cause I guess her dad subscribes to the school newspaper, and he picked it up and I saw the headline said this!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"What the fuck is this bro?
"
19,8,PC Bro 11,"Bro, that little kid wrote that our tolerant views and fight for social justice is just a way for us to crush puss!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"That's not true!!
"
19,8,PC Bro 11,"I know, bro!! We're being totally victimized!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"That little fucker, dude!
"
19,8,Representative,"Hello. You're the boy responsible for the South Park Super School News?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"That's right.
"
19,8,Representative,"We would like to give you $26 million.  Contracts, and the first check. We'd love to be in business with you.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"What is this for?
"
19,8,Representative,"I represent an organization called Geico. It's an insurance company. We think Super School News would be a great way for us to reach new customers.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Sorry Charlie, but I don't allow ads in my newspaper.
"
19,8,Representative,"We've heard all about that, so we thought you could just do some ...news stories about car insurance. Just state the facts, because the truth is, everyone can save by switching to Geico.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"That's called ""sponsored content."" I know the difference between the news and ads. Do you think I'm stupid?
"
19,8,Representative,"Everyone's doing it, Jim. You're sort of the last holdout. $26 million just to write some news stories that get people thinking about their insurance coverage?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Sth-sth-sth, stick it up your ass!
"
19,8,Representative,"Hm.  Well, they said you'd be tough.  Do you really think you can stop ads?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Yes.
"
19,8,Representative,"You can try to block ads, but they get smarter. The more we ty to shut them out, the more clever they get. There's a war coming, kid, and I'm gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it. 
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Officer Barbrady?
"
19,8,Barbrady,"Come with me if you want to live!  Come on! Come with me if you want to live! I'm serious! 
"
19,8,Sharon,"Do you want to explain to me what pussy crushing is?!
"
19,8,Randy,"What?
"
19,8,Sharon,"Your little meetings you go to at night to discuss social justice?!  It's just a way to pick up on young women?!
"
19,8,Randy,"Sh-sharon, most of the guys in my PC club are right out of college, alright? You know how college kids are. Who wrote this?
"
19,8,Sharon,"I don't want you going over there anymore!
"
19,8,Randy,"I don't cheat on you, Sharon! I'm happy. Look at what's happened to our town. We have ShiTpaTown, boutique restaurants and artisan shops. We have a fucking Whole Foods, and that was all me! Diverse people are moving here, and everyone is being aware of how they talk. This is paradise, Sharon!
"
19,8,Sharon,"Is it?  All I know is that you've changed. Every since you joined this PC thing you just bully people. And wait for people to say anything improper so you can jump down their throats for whatever words he or she used.
"
19,8,Randy,"He or she is an agenderphobic microagressions, Sharon. You are a bigot. 
"
19,8,Agent,"The average human can no longer tell the difference between the news and an ad. You seem to have some mental ability that allows you to know the difference.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Does this have to do with me calling the school principal a pussy crusher?
"
19,8,Agent,"The PC People are simply being manipulated, unwittingly setting the table for the new enemy of humanity.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"You mean ISIS or ninjas?
"
19,8,Agent,"Something... much worse.  Have you ever felt like an ad had... intelligence? That it somehow knew what you wanted, even before you knew you wanted it? [] What if I were to tell you that ads have become smarter than us? And now they're manipulating everything we do?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"I'd say that sounds pretty retarded.
"
19,8,Agent,"It was our own fault. Mankind became tired of ads, so we kept inventing ways to make things ad-free. We even created ad blockers. That's when the ads had to adapt. They had to disguise themselves as news in order to survive.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Sponsored content?
"
19,8,Agent,"If you really can tell the difference, then you could be the key to saving our species, Jimmy. We'd like to run a test on you.
"
19,8,Computer,"Sponsored Content, Test 17-B, Ready. Begin. 
"
19,8,Jimmy,"That's the news.  That's an ad.  That's the news.  That's an ad.  That's the news. That's an ad. That's an ad. That's the new-oh no, that's an ad for act food. My bad.
"
19,8,Agent,"Jesus Christ, he's off the charts.
"
19,8,Agent 2,"Increase the intensity.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"That's the news  That's an ad. News. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. News. News. Ad. Ad. Slideshow. Ad. 
"
19,8,Agent,"That's a perfect score. You are a very special child, Jimmy.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"I prefer ""handicapped,"" actually.
"
19,8,Agent,"We have another child here who's special too.  Do you know... Leslie? 
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Alright, that's good. Everyone get inside. Everything past here is safe space.  No reporters, no harassment. We are gonna figure this shit out.  All I know is that I don't speak up for minorities so that I can crush pussy.
"
19,8,PC Bro 16,"Me neither, dude. I want social justice and now I'm being made fun of.
"
19,8,PC Bro 17,"Yeah bro. They're taking our incredibly tolerant views and distorting them.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"PC people are under attack. That's what this is.
"
19,8,PC Bro 18,"Hey yeah. Bro! We're the victims now. Like, we're being marginalized. Like... that makes us pretty cool.
"
19,8,Topher,"Yeah, I bet now we can get a lot more puss.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"No, Topher! It's not about puss, alright?! The fuck is wrong with you?! We're being labeled as meatheads who just wanna crush puss by an intolerant newspaper!
"
19,8,PC Bro 16,"Yeah, fuck that dude, bro!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Yeah. And like, if you're gonna belittle and make fun of PC people like that, then who's to say he won't do it to other marginalized groups like us? I mean, this kid could be the next Hitler. And if you guys could stop Hitler, what would you do?
"
19,8,PC Bro 9,"I'd rip that dude apart and then go home and totally smash some puss, bro.
"
19,8,Other Bros,"Hell yeah!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Nooo!
"
19,8,Leslie,"You look familiar. Don't you go to my school?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Yes. Uh, I'm Jimmy. Editor In Chief of Super School News. 
"
19,8,Leslie,"I'm Leslie.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"N, nice to finally talk to you.
"
19,8,Leslie,"Did they bring you in and give you a bunch of tests too?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Yes, they did. Do you know who ""they"" are?
"
19,8,Leslie,"I think they're ex-newsmen. You know, the men in suits who used to be in charge of the news.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"I thought I recognized them.
"
19,8,Leslie,"They told me I was special. Are you special too?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"I prefer ""handicapped.""
"
19,8,Leslie,"I like that.
"
19,8,Mr. Garrison,"Principal Victoria, if everything you've said is true, then, why doesn't anyone know about it?
"
19,8,Principal Victoria,"There are people who know. But they have to stay very hidden.
"
19,8,Mr. Garrison,"I'm just havin' a hard time swallowing all this. And between me and this one over here, we can swallow just about anything.
"
19,8,Caitlyn Jenner,"Oh God, you're such an asshole.
"
19,8,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Garrison, I wasn't fired. I was replaced. This goes much higher than anyone knows.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"I came to this town really thinking I could make a difference. I've been called a bigot towards persons with disabilities. I've been called...  Pussy-crusher, because of the behavior of a very few individuals in my PC frat.  Jimmy Valmer is off the school newspaper. I want you to take over.
"
19,8,Nathan,"Ooooh boy!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"And I will be reviewing your paper to make sure nobody is ever attacked the way I was again.
"
19,8,Nathan,"I think this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Jimmy almost made me lose confidence, but I know who I am. I know what I am!
"
19,8,PC Bro 11,"Dude! Bro!  Oh, bro, I went online to read a news story about immigrants being discriminated against.
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Yeah?
"
19,8,PC Bro 11,"PC Principal what's on the screen.]
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Dude!  What the fuck, bro?
"
19,8,PC Bro 11,"What does this mean, dude?
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Bro! What the fuck, bro?!
"
19,8,Leslie,"Do you like our school, Jimmy.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Uh yes, Leslie, I like our school very much.
"
19,8,Leslie,"I like our school too. I like the kids who go there.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Uh huh. I'm starting to wonder something about you, Leslie.
"
19,8,Leslie,"I'm starting to wonder about you. I mean, you seem like a nice kid, but... don't you feel like you could be happier? 
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Holy. Shit.
"
19,8,Leslie,"What?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Can you excuse me for a moment?
"
19,8,Leslie,"Okay. 
"
19,8,Agent,"Well Jimmy? What do you think?
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Does she know she's an ad?
"
19,8,Agent 3,"He can spot them.
"
19,8,Jimmy,"Does she know she's an ad?!
"
19,8,PC Principal,"What the hell is going on, bro?!
"
19,8,PC Bro 19,"Bro?
"
19,8,PC Principal,"Bro, what the hell is going on, bro?
"
19,8,Principal Victoria,"If we're going back, remember: we don't know who we can trust.
"
19,8,Mr. Garrison,"If they wanna mess with my town, I'll fuck every last one of them! Let's do this!
"
19,8,Caitlyn Jenner,"Buckle up, buckaroos! 
"
19,9,Mrs. Nelson,"Alright guys, now let's go back and talk about infinitives . Remember, those are verbs combined with the work ""to.""
"
19,9,Cartman,"Oh my fucking God...
"
19,9,Mrs. Nelson,"Now, usually an infinitive acts like a noun, as in ""I wans TO go out to eat"" or  ""I hope TO be chosen today.""
"
19,9,Kyle,"What?
"
19,9,Cartman,"I'm so bored, dude.
"
19,9,Mrs. Nelson,"Now usually, it isn't common to split TO and the verb, but sometimes you can, ,
"
19,9,Kyle,"Knock it off!
"
19,9,Mrs. Nelson,"as in-. Is there a problem, guys?
"
19,9,Kyle,"Go get my pen, fatass
"
19,9,Cartman,"I am not your slave, Kyle.
"
19,9,Kyle,"Go get my pen!
"
19,9,Mr. Mackey,"Attention, students. Kyle Broflovski report to the Principal's office please?
"
19,9,Cartman,"PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle!
"
19,9,Mr. Mackey,"Kyle Broflovski to the Principal's office please, okay?
"
19,9,Kyle,"Goddammit! 
"
19,9,Cartman,"Have fun, dude.
"
19,9,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, Kyle.  Uhh, uhh, thank you for coming.
"
19,9,Kyle,"Where's PC Principal?
"
19,9,Mr. Mackey,"I think he's finally lost it, Kyle. He and his PC buddies are on a hunger strike and, they're calling for people's resignations. Kyle, PC Principal had problems with Jimmy and with Leslie. And now they're missing. Okay? Nobody knows where they are. That's what happens. You go against PC, and you just end up missing. Okay?
"
19,9,Kyle,"What are you talking about?
"
19,9,Mr. Mackey,"PC Principal had issues with them. Okay? And he had issues with you, Kyle. Whatever's goin' on, it's pretty damn scary.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"For years, mankind has tried to rid the world of ads. For our ancestors, ads couldn't be avoided. But everyone knew what was an ad, and what wasn't. After many years, mankind invented cable. A way to p-pay for television so there would be no ads. But somehow, the ads still found a way. And so mankind invented Tivo. A way to skip past commercials. Finally, it appeared to be the end of ads. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads were stopped. Or so it seemed. With he rise of the Internet suddenly the ads got an en- tirely new way to attack us. Popups. The top scientific minds were brought together to find a way to stop the ads, once and for all. They invented the ad blocker. Suddenly there were no ads on phones, on computers. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads adapted. They became s-smarter. They disguised themselves as news. All around the world people read news stories completely unaware that they were reading ads	. And now, the ads have taken the next step in their evolution. They have taken human form. Ads are among us. They could be your friend, your g-gardener. The ads are trying to wipe us out. But the question is... how?
"
19,9,Randy,"So, um, ahem, South Park kind of sucks now. You guys wanna bail? 
"
19,9,Sharon,"What?
"
19,9,Shelley,"What are you talking about?
"
19,9,Randy,"It's just, you know, it used to be nice and laid-back here, but now it's all  Uuuuhhh, you know? Like like now everybody's all Uuhh-uuhhh. Let's bail. You wanna bail, Stan?
"
19,9,Stan,"No, I don't. 
"
19,9,Sharon,"What's going on, Randy?
"
19,9,Randy,"Nothing! I just... You know, we don't have to live here, we can live anywhere.
"
19,9,Sharon,"Last month, all you could talk about was how great this town had become. What changed your mind?
"
19,9,Randy,"...We can't afford it. 
"
19,9,Sharon,"We can't afford it?
"
19,9,Randy,"All these fancy new restaurants and shops and,  everyone wants to live here! A bowl of City beef costs ten bucks now, for Christ's sake. And there's nowhere to shop but stupid Whole Foods!
"
19,9,Sharon,"Well, we'll just have to stop going to those places.
"
19,9,Randy,"I had to take out a second mortgage on the house.
"
19,9,Sharon,"You  what?
"
19,9,Randy,"I had to, Sharon! It isn't my fault! It's the Man. Don't you see? The Man... ir pricing us out of our own town.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"It's just my luck. I talk to a nice girl, seem to hit it off, and she turns out to just be an ad.
"
19,9,Tom,"Well, that's what an ad does. She was designed to entice, and manipulate.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"This is such a fantastic story for the school newspaper. Why don't we just run it so that everyone knows the truth?
"
19,9,Tom,"Jimmy, we're newsmen, like you. For decades we used our soft buttery voices to inform the people about what's happening. Then we watched as our entire industry was taken over by the ads.  Some of our colleagues were manipulated into doing the ads' bidding. The man who came to your house with a gun was one of them. Our own Kevin Jarvis has more.
"
19,9,Kevin,"Thanks, Tom. Jimmy, the man who tried to kill you was Brian Boint, of WXNR, Fort Collins. When he saw there was no money in news anymore he sided with the ads, even though he knew it meant the destruction of our species. Back to you, Tom.
"
19,9,Tom,"Thanks, Kevin. The only hope for the truth to get out there, Jimmy, is for you to see through this ad's deception and to find out what they're planning. Your Super School News was a threat to them. But unless you get this little bitch to talk, we may never know why.
"
19,9,Stan,"Dude, Kyle. Will you look at this? 
"
19,9,Kyle,"""Principal Sends Two Favorite Students On A Disney Cruise. This week, students Jimmy Valmer and Leslie Meyers are being treated to an all-expenses-paid vacation for their outstanding school-"" what the hell is this?
"
19,9,Stan,"It doesn't make any sense, dude. PC Principal is using the school paper to cover something up.
"
19,9,Kyle,"Yeah I... Ah I don't wanna get involved.
"
19,9,Stan,"You don't wanna get involved? Dude, what's wrong with you?
"
19,9,Kyle,"I've already learned you can't win against PC Principal. You should know of all people since he converted your dad.
"
19,9,Stan,"What's that supposed to mean?
"
19,9,Butters,"Fellas! We found out what happened to Jimmy! He got to go on a vacation for being an exemplary student.
"
19,9,Stan,"That is not what happened! Something is very wrong here! We all have to stand up to PC Principal together!
"
19,9,Cartman,"Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out?
"
19,9,Nathan,"I like the school paper. I like to type with my hands. 
"
19,9,Kyle,"Who told you that the principal sent Jimmy on a Disney Cruise?
"
19,9,Nathan,"Uhhh. Uhhh. Uhhh, I don't remember.
"
19,9,Stan,"You have quotes in here from Jimmy. Did you talk to him?
"
19,9,Nathan,"Uhhh. Uhhh, I like the school paper.
"
19,9,Stan,"Come on, we'll get to the bottom of this. 
"
19,9,Nathan,"Did I do good, computer?  I think the sponsored content fooled them. I hope I made you happy. Can you see me, computer? Do you know what I'm thinking right now?  Ahh, thanks, computer.
"
19,9,Principal Victoria,"We have to make sure nobody recognizes us. There's no telling who works for who. Here, Caitlyn, I got you this fake mustache to put on.
"
19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"I'm not putting on a mustache, I'll look silly.
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, that, that's where you draw the line, huh Caitlyn?
"
19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"Don't be an asshole.
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"No, you're right, that's nuts! A woman wearing a mustache, that's just ridiculous, huh Cait?
"
19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"Alright alright, I'll put it on, fuck.
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"No no, please, Cait, don't put on a fake mustache, that's c-razy.  You don't want people thinking you're a weirdo, I mean, Jeez.
"
19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"You-hur such an asshole.
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell is this? What have they done to my town?
"
19,9,Principal Victoria,"Keep your voice down.
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Since when do we have a flippin' Whole Foods?! 
"
19,9,Principal Victoria,"Everything's changed.
"
19,9,Survey worker,"Hi there, you got a minute for gay rights?
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Gay rights? Jeez, you've already got all those. What the hell do you wanna do now? 
"
19,9,Clerk,"All right, your total is a hundred twenty six thirty nine, and would you like to give a dollar to help hungry children get iPads to protect your Internet safe space today?
"
19,9,Stephen,"I will.
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"What the Sam Hell is goin' on!
"
19,9,Leslie,"Why would anyone think that I'm on the principal's side? I hate the principal. I think he's a dick.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"So you don't know anything about the principal that might be newsworthy? Super School News worthy?
"
19,9,Leslie,"Just that he hated me and called me a blabbermouth. I don't think I'm a blabbermouth. I just like talking to people.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Leslie, what kind of... plans do you have? Do you have any... plans?
"
19,9,Leslie,"What kind of plans?
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Just, you know, plans. Like what are you hoping tooo... accomplish? 
"
19,9,Leslie,"I don't know. What are your plans?
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Well, I want to pursue careers in both news reporting and comedy.
"
19,9,Leslie,"Really? That's... different.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Yeah, you're pretty different yourself, Leslie.
"
19,9,Leslie,"How so?
"
19,9,Jimmy,"I'm starting to think that maybe all ads aren't so bad.
"
19,9,Tom,"Jimmy, you're thinking with your dick.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"I am not thinking with my dick.
"
19,9,Tom,"Yes you are.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"No, I just think that she's a-
"
19,9,Tom,"Put your dick away.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"She's ag- emotional
"
19,9,Tom,"Jim.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Interesting, caring girl.
"
19,9,Tom,"Jimmy, that's your dick talking.  Believe me, I know how you feel. Ads promise us things. Ads are perfect. But make no mistake:  all ads lie. And all ads deceive.
"
19,9,Kyle,"There. Leslie's Instagram and her Twitter. Last entry was ten days ago.
"
19,9,Butters,"What about Jimmy's?
"
19,9,Kyle,"Jimmy never used that stuff, remember? He said he hated using the Internet.
"
19,9,Cartman,"How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties.
"
19,9,Butters,"What are you doing now?
"
19,9,Kyle,"I'm just looking for any news articles or anything about PC Principal.  Where did you say PC Principal was from?
"
19,9,Stan,"I think it was Vermont.
"
19,9,Kyle,"Maybe there's something from the news in Vermont that could give us a clue about-  Goddammit what the hell is this?
"
19,9,Stan,"That's an ad for skiing in Vermont.
"
19,9,Butters,"Wow that looks fun! 
"
19,9,Kyle,"Dude. Dude, look at this. ""How PC Culture is changing Vermont from a state of intolerance to a s-""  Dude there it is again!
"
19,9,Kenny,"What?
"
19,9,Kyle,"It's that goddamned guitar! This ad is fucking following me!
"
19,9,Stan,"Just click out of it.
"
19,9,Kyle,"I'm trying! Goddammit get over here!
"
19,9,Stan,"That's a pretty sweet-looking guitar.
"
19,9,Kyle,"It is pretty cool dude, it tunes itself.
"
19,9,Cartman,"How does it do that?
"
19,9,Kyle,"It's this company that does all kinds of hi-tech instruments. See look, I'll show you.
Stan:	Oh that's sweet. Send me the link to that so I can-  Oh dude that new Frankenstein movie is out. I totally wanna see that.
"
19,9,Cartman,"That movie's gonna suck dude.
"
19,9,Stan,"Hit the arrow, I wanna see where it's playing.
"
19,9,Kyle,"OH. Sorry, wrong arrow button. 
"
19,9,Butters,"Wow, what kind of ice cream is that?
"
19,9,Butters,"So Clyde said to Token, ""Why don't you open a bank account with your mouth so I can deposit my dick in it?"" 
"
19,9,Kyle,"So then what'd Token say?
"
19,9,Butters,"Well Token was all like-
"
19,9,Stan,"Wait wait wait wait wait whoa, whoa. What the hell are we doing?
"
19,9,Cartman,"Eating ice cream, dipshit.
"
19,9,Stan,"But what about Jimmy? We were all like totally trying to find out what happened to him.
"
19,9,Kyle,"Whoa, what the hell just happened?
"
19,9,Butters,"We got distracted. We've gotta get back to that computer! 
"
19,9,Skeeter,"Now this here is a dry Riesling. You're gonna experience vanilla after-tones and a nutty finish.
"
19,9,Rancher,"You mean like someone put their balls in the glass?
"
19,9,Skeeter,"No, like chestnuts, dammit!
"
19,9,Rancher,"I just can't keep up with this town no more. Everything's gettin' all nice and fancy. I swear I'm gonna need to get a second mortgage on the ranch just to pay muh daily expenses.
"
19,9,Randy,"Don't you get it? That's just what they want. Nobody cares about the people who lived here before. They want us to move, 'cause they wanna knock our houses down and build more lofts and villas!
"
19,9,Skeeter,"Alright Randy, you should probably lay off the old vine Châteauneuf-du-Pape.
"
19,9,Randy,"You'll all see! Pretty soon everyone who used to live here is gonna have to move. And we'll be shopping at Safeway again. 
"
19,9,Randy (singing),"Where has my town gone? Where has- 
"
19,9,Randy,"Oooff!
"
19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"You like apples?  How d'you like them apples? 
"
19,9,Randy,"Hey, it's Caitlyn Jenner! 
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Check his ass!
"
19,9,Randy,"Principal Victoria? 
"
19,9,Victoria,"He's one of them.
"
19,9,Randy,"One of what?
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Caitlyn. 
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Okay Leslie, let's try a different approach. Let's say you wanted tooo... destroy the entire species. How would you go about it?
"
19,9,Leslie,"Why would I want to destroy an entire species? You have the wrong idea about me, Jimmy. The person trying to change things and make things terrible is the new principal.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"And what is the new principal trying to do, Leslie?
"
19,9,Leslie,"He's trying to make sure that people like you and me aren't allowed to exist. I know that you're trying to help. I know that the newsmen in there are trying to help too.  But now I'm going to tell you something very important, Jimmy. 
"
19,9,The Chevy Ad,"Like a rock. I drive a Chevy, I'm a cowboy, and I drive it like a rock.
"
19,9,Kevin,"Tom, it looks like a popup ad.
"
19,9,Tom,"How did an ad get in here? Let's go to David at the network hub.
"
19,9,David,"No answers here, Tom. We're trying to correct the problem.
"
19,9,Leslie,"You have to get me out of here, Jimmy. They're going to kill me.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"What?
"
19,9,Leslie,"Listen to me carefully and don't look at the glass. I feel something for you I have never felt before. I think it's trust. The men in there are sick with hatred and as soon as they realize I have no information they are going to burn me. I've seen them do it to others. Please, you have to help me, Jimmy. Don't let them hurt me. Please don't abandon me. When the lights go back on just look at me and smile.
"
19,9,Tom,"David, any word on the popup ad situation?
"
19,9,David,"Tom, we've just about got it fixed. It should be ready now. 
"
19,9,Leslie,"And that's really it, Jimmy. I want to help all of you however I can. 
"
19,9,Cartman,"And then Token tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead. 
"
19,9,Stan,"Wait wait wait wait whoa whoa. What the hell are we doing?
"
19,9,Butters,"We're tryin' on shoes and eatin' chicken nuggets, stupid. What do you think?
"
19,9,Stan,"No. That's not what we set out to do.
"
19,9,Kyle,"We were... We were on Cartman's computer looking up news stories about PC Principal.
"
19,9,Cartman,"Didn't we finish doing that?
"
19,9,Stan,"No, we didn't.
"
19,9,Kyle,"It's like... someone's trying to... distract us.  Because they're worried what we'll uncover about PC people.
"
19,9,Stan,"Yeah, like one of us is purposefully trying to keep us from digging too deep because they're afraid.
"
19,9,Kyle,"Why are you looking at me?
"
19,9,Stan,"Why are you looking at me?
"
19,9,Cartman,"Why isn't anyone looking at me?
"
19,9,Randy,"Hey, fuck you.
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Wake up, dickhead!
"
19,9,Randy,"Garrison? The hell is wrong with you?!
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"I'll tell you what's wrong with me! There's enemies to humanity out there wantin' to put an end to all of us, and there's assholes like you helpin' them out!
"
19,9,Randy,"I don't know what you're talking about.
"
19,9,Victoria,"Whose idea was it to revitalize the shitty part of town into an arts and foods district called ShiTpaTown?
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Son of a bitch!
"
19,9,Randy,"What? To take one area of town that was rappy and gentrify it for the local people to enjoy? I thought we could keep it contained.
"
19,9,Victoria,"It doesn't contain. What's happened to South Park is happening everywhere.  Thirty miles south of here in the town of Fairplay, they've changed the area north od Downtown into NoDoFoPa. A rundown area south of the capital in Cheyenne, Wyoming, is now historic SoCaCheyWo. Channel Street in mid-Chicago is being revitalized into Chimichanga.
"
19,9,Randy,"Oh my God.
"
19,9,Victoria,"LoDo, SoBro, RivMo, all happening at the same time. And it isn't just in the U.S. In Cairo, the area northwest of the third pyramid is NoWe3Pi. Three miles north of Auschwitz is NoMoAuchie. It goes on and on!
"
19,9,Randy,"What does it mean?
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"In our town it all started when PC Principal arrived. He's part of a mjuch larger conspiracy, and you're his lackey.
"
19,9,Randy,"Not me. If PC Principal has been using us, I'll take the bastard down myself.
"
19,9,Reporter,"It's day two of the hunger strike started by the college-aged fraternity brothers who are demanding that all of South Park's community leaders step down. The PC frat brothers say they've gone now two days without eating any pussy, and will continue to do so until people resign.
"
19,9,Tom,"Who is that reporter? Do we... know him?
"
19,9,Kevin,"Tom, that's Bill Keegan, WCFO.
"
19,9,Tom,"Thanks, Brian.  He's working for the ads, obviously. Sellout douche-bag.
"
19,9,Newsman,"That's right, Tom. He was always a douche-bag at the conventions.
"
19,9,Tom,"Thanks, Rick. Stay dry.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Leslie, come on.
"
19,9,Leslie,"Jimmy. You're gonna help me?
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Yeah I'm gonna help you. I mean, come on.
"
19,9,Tom,"Jimmy! 
"
19,9,Newsman 2,"Oh Jesus, he let her out.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"PC Principal is our enemy, not her.
"
19,9,Tom,"His dick is compromised.  Stay back! 
"
19,9,Jimmy,"It is not my dick. I am thinking rationally and with logic. I am taking her out of here!
"
19,9,Tom,"Well then,  I'm sorry I'm going to have to do this, Jimmy.  Officer Barbrady, we need you to shoot these kids.
"
19,9,Barbrady,"What?
"
19,9,Tom,"The ad has got to him.  There's no time to argue.
"
19,9,Barbrady,"I'm not shooting any more kids.
"
19,9,Tom,"Do you want to save your town?!
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Officer Barbrady, we have to stop PC Principal before it's too late.
"
19,9,Tom,"Barbrady, shoot them in their heads!
"
19,9,Barbrady,"No! I'm not shooting any more people! Not for you, not for nobody!
"
19,9,Tom,"You're making the worst mistake of your life, officer.
"
19,9,Barbrady,"Maybe so. All I know is I'm done shooting people! 
"
19,9,Kevin,"Augh!
"
19,9,Barbrady,"Oh sorry. Jeez. 
"
19,9,Tom,"Dammit!
"
19,9,Stan,"Think about it, you guys. From the moment that PC Principal took over Kyle has been different. Haven't you noticed?
"
19,9,Butters,"Yeah.
"
19,9,Stan,"He's distracting us, either because he's too afraid or because he- 
"
19,9,Kyle,"Well what are you guys talking about?
"
19,9,Butters,"Nothin'.
"
19,9,Cartman,"Stan's calling you a traitor.
"
19,9,Kyle,"What?!
"
19,9,Stan,"Kyle, I think it's pretty obvious you don't want us investigating PC Principal.
"
19,9,Kyle,"And why do you think that, Stan?!
"
19,9,Stan,"I don't know.
"
19,9,Kyle,"Because if anyone has a reason for us not mess with PC Principal, it's you! Let's not forget that Stan's dad is PC Principal's little bitch!
"
19,9,Butters,"Wuh huh, that's a good point.
"
19,9,Cartman,"I am loving this right now.
"
19,9,Stan,"My dad's stupid, not a bitch! This is about you being scared, Kyle!
"
19,9,Kyle,"It is you, isn't it?! That's why you're trying to shift the blame on me. That's very Cartman of you, Stan!
"
19,9,Cartman,"Hoh that's low. 
"
19,9,Stan,"Don't you dare call me a Cartman!
"
19,9,Kyle,"N-ho, that's good! Just keep on distracting everybody! It seems to be working, Cartman!
"
19,9,Stan,"Fuck you, Kyle! 
"
19,9,Cartman,"Fight! 
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Time to take this asshole down!
"
19,9,Randy,"Whoa whoa whoa, guys, whoa! We can't just go walking in there.
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Why not?
"
19,9,Randy,"This is a safe space. We're not allowed past this. When you breach a college safe space, you're crossing the most sacred human boundary there is.
"
19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"J'hoh, give me a break.
"
19,9,Randy,"Nonononono, look, this is very real, and very important in PC culture. Every human has a right to a safe space and it cannot be entered.
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"I can. Watch. 
"
19,9,Randy,"Wow, how did you-?  Whoa.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Burning the midnight oil, huh Nathan?
"
19,9,Nathan,"Jimmy.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"You sonofabitch. What have you done to the Super School News?
"
19,9,Nathan,"I was just holding down the fort while you were away, Jim.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Writing headlines sponsored by PC Principal and the ads? How much did they pay you?!
"
19,9,Nathan,"Please, Jimmy, I'm just trying to survive here.
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Everyone's gonna know the truth, Nathan. We're getting a new edition of the school paper out by morning. Everyone's gonna know all about the ads. 
"
19,9,Leslie,"Deal with him. 
"
19,9,Jimmy,"Leslie... I thought we were b-b-b-besties.
"
19,9,Nathan,"Hey there, big man. Editor of the school paper, huh? You still don't even know half the story.
"
19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"It's clear.
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Where is everybody? I thought the news said they're on a hunger strike.
"
19,9,Randy,"It doesn't make sense. Someone's always here.
"
19,9,Victoria,"Take a look at this! 
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell?
"
19,9,Victoria,"It looks like he was researching this. You see this news story?
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"If this is true, then... PC Principal's trying to help.
"
19,9,Randy,"Click on that. What is that?
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"No, click out of that. What is this?
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"So, so then, so then Caitlyn says ""Look bitch, you're married to Bill Clinton. If anyone should be afraid of AIDS, it's you.""
"
19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"That stupid bitch had it coming. 
"
19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh God, I love you, Cait. We're so gong to win the primaries. 
"
19,9,Randy,"Whoa, whoawhoawhoa wait wait wait. What, what were we doing again?
"
19,9,Kyle,"Leslie.
"
19,9,Leslie,"You're trying to find out what's going on, right? But your friend is standing in your way?
"
19,9,Kyle,"How do you know thi-?
"
19,9,Leslie,"I can show you what's going on, Kyle. But you have to trust me.  What's the last four digits of your Sosh?
"
19,9,Kyle,"2692 
"
19,10,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others.
"
19,10,Russian 1,"Is it him?
"
19,10,Russian 2,"Yes, it's him. PC Principal.
"
19,10,PC Principal,"You know, if there's one thing that makes me sick, it's when a race thinks they're superior and don't know how to check their privilege. 
"
19,10,Russian 3,"I'm not one of them! I'm not one of them!
"
19,10,PC Principal,"An African-American flips a turtle over on its back. A transgender Filipino comes and sees the helpless turtle baking in the sun. What color is the Filipino's father?  I didn't think you were human. 
"
19,10,Butters,"Yeah, everybody's pretty freaked out over here, baby. Everyone is on edge and feelin' really nervous.
"
19,10,Charlotte,"That sounds terrible. Be careful, Butters.
"
19,10,Butters,"I will, honey.
"
19,10,Kyle,"Butters.  Get to the bathroom. Now. 
"
19,10,Stan,"Alright Kyle, what's this about?
"
19,10,Kyle,"Jimmy's dead.
"
19,10,Cartman,"What?
"
19,10,Kyle,"I know the whole story. PC Principal killed him, and tried to kill Leslie, but she got away.
"
19,10,Kenny,"(Are you fuckin' serious, dude?)
"
19,10,Kyle,"PC Principal is part of a huge network of radicals who kill everyone who doesn't follow their PC ideology.
"
19,10,Stan,"How do you know all this?
"
19,10,Kyle,"Because Leslie's with me. I'm keeping her safe.
"
19,10,Butters,"Heh,  Kyle's got a girlfriend?
"
19,10,Kyle,"It gets worse. Someone in this town helped these people come here. That person faked the Bill Cosby joke to get Principal Victoria fired.
"
19,10,Cartman,"Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda?
"
19,10,Kyle,"I think it's obvious. Stan's dad.
"
19,10,Stan,"Kyle!
"
19,10,Kyle,"Stan, your dad is one of them. He had to be the one to let them in.
"
19,10,Stan,"You're letting paranoia and suspicion get the better of you! 
"
19,10,Kyle,"There's no way to know who we can trust.
"
19,10,Cartman,"So what do we do now?
"
19,10,Kyle,"There's only one thing we can do.  We have to get guns.
"
19,10,Butters,"Guns?
"
19,10,Kyle,"It's the only way for us to be safe.
"
19,10,Cartman,"Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns?
"
19,10,Cartman,"Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what?
"
19,10,Kenny,"(Now we need to steal a car and escape.)
"
19,10,Butters,"I already feel a lot safer.
"
19,10,Kyle,"You guys lay low and watch your backs. I'm gonna go keep Leslie protected.
"
19,10,Cartman,"Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner.  Do I look sweet, Butters?
"
19,10,Butters,"Yeah.
"
19,10,Randy,"What?
"
19,10,Stan,"What?
"
19,10,Sharon,"Can you pass the garlic bread, Randy?
"
19,10,Randy,"Why wouldn't I be able to pass the garlic bread? 
"
19,10,Stan,"Dad, where were you last night?
"
19,10,Randy,"What, wait. Where was I what? Out, with friends, doing things.  Well I'm full. I'm gonna go work in the garage for a little bit. 
"
19,10,Stan,"Work on what?
"
19,10,Randy,"On stuff to do, things.  Um, oh I'm gonna take some of this with me. I'm still hungry.
"
19,10,Sharon,"I thought you just said you were full.
"
19,10,Randy,"Jee-sus! What? Am I on trial or something? God-damn!  You guys are really acting strange. 
"
19,10,Randy,"Alright, we're good. Nobody suspects a thing. 
"
19,10,Mr. Garrison,"Take a look at this.
"
19,10,Principal Victoria,"We've got everything from PC Principal's hard drive. He was on to the gentrification around the world, and he was convinced that whatever was responsible... wasn't... human.
"
19,10,Randy,"Not human? Then what?
"
19,10,Mr. Garrison,"I don't care if they're aliens or vampires, we need to round them up fast and fuck them till they're dead.
"
19,10,Caitlyn Jenner,"You don't wanna fuck a vampire, you'll get hepatitis.
"
19,10,Mr. Garrison,"Oh girlfriend, I'm well beyond that. 
"
19,10,Randy,"Oh my God. Don't you see what this means? If something not human is gentrifying the entire world, soon no human will be ale to afford it. They're trying to price our species out of existence.
"
19,10,Nathan,"Well? How do you like my new apartment?
"
19,10,Jimmy,"What happened to you, Nathan? I always thought you were a nice kid. Now you've got a gun?
"
19,10,Nathan,"Huh. Everyone's gettin' one of these now, Jim. Nobody knows whom to trust.
"
19,10,Jimmy,"Yeah? Well guns are never the answer.
"
19,10,Nathan,"Don't you kinda wish you'd had one back when Leslie betrayed you and nearly beat you to death?
"
19,10,Jimmy,"Oh. I guess it would have been a decent answer then. Tou-t-t-t.. touché.
"
19,10,Nathan,"You see, I've got expensive tastes, Jimmy. I like good food.  Organic pressed juices. And I've got a thing for high-class prostitutes.  Have you been introduced to my current girlfriend?
"
19,10,Classi,"My name is Classi, with an I, and a little dick hanging off the C that bends around and fucks the L out of the A S S.
"
19,10,Jimmy,"Nice to meet you, Classi.
"
19,10,Nathan,"All I had to do was work for the ads and I got everything I wanted. My own loft, with all of ShiTpaTown right at my doorstep. All it took was some PC and the whole thing was set in motion.
"
19,10,Jimmy,"Oh great. So now ads are using PC for their own gain? That's a new low.
"
19,10,Nathan,"What is PC but a verbal form of gentrification? Spruce everything up, get rid of all the ugliness in order to create a false sense of paradise. Only one thing can actually live in that world. Ads.
"
19,10,Jimmy,"I know I've said it before, but man, do I hate ads.
"
19,10,Liane,"Eric Cartman, I told you to get ready for bed!
"
19,10,Cartman,"Yeah, I just want finish this movie.
"
19,10,Liane,"No, Eric! This is a school night!
"
19,10,Cartman,"Mom, I'm into this movie. I'm not going to bed right now. Chillax.
"
19,10,Liane,"You most certainly are! Right now, mister!
"
19,10,Cartman,"I will go to bed  when this movie is over, Mom!
"
19,10,Liane,"Eric, where did you get that?
"
19,10,Cartman,"Turn off the light and go back to bed. I'm staying up.
"
19,10,Liane,"Eric, you march right up to your room, and you-
"
19,10,Cartman,"I don't think so, Mom.
"
19,10,Liane,"Eric, you get your butt to bed!
"
19,10,Cartman,"No means no, Bill Cosby!
"
19,10,Liane,"I told you to go upstairs right now!
"
19,10,Cartman,"Whoa, Mom, what the hell?
"
19,10,Liane,"I'm not going to tell you again, Eric! It is time... for night-night!
"
19,10,Cartman,"Mom, put down the gun.
"
19,10,Liane,"I am your mother, and you will do what I tell you!
"
19,10,Cartman,"Okay, I am going. 
"
19,10,Liane,"Well then, you go right now, Mister! 
"
19,10,Cartman,"I'm going to bed now, Mom. Chillax. 
"
19,10,Liane,"Alright then. No comic books, just straight to sleep! I love you, sweetie.
"
19,10,Cartman,"Okay, I love you too, Mom. Night-night. 
"
19,10,Liane,"Wow, he... he listened. 
"
19,10,Randy,"There has to be something. Some clue as to what we're dealing with.
"
19,10,Principal Victoria,"The news stories PC Principal researched are all so contradictory, as if whatever these things are have control over the news somehow.
"
19,10,Randy,"That sounds like vampires to me.
"
19,10,Principal Victoria,"We have to find out who had me fired with the Cosby joke. It's the key to knowing what we're dealing with.
"
19,10,Stan,"Principal Victoria?  Mr. Garrison? Caitlyn Jenner?
"
19,10,Randy,"Stan, what the hell are you doing in here?
"
19,10,Stan,"Tell me what's going on, Dad?
"
19,10,Randy,"Nothing. We're just hanging out, talking about Coldplay, alright?
"
19,10,Stan,"No! I wanna know what the hell is going on right now!
"
19,10,Randy,"What are you doing with that?
"
19,10,Stan,"Kyle said I couldn't trust you! What are you planning, Dad?
"
19,10,Randy,"Stan, it isn't what you think.
"
19,10,Stan,"Then what is it?!
"
19,10,Randy,"Look, I need to show you something, okay? You need to see this, son.  Ohh! Psych! Now put the fucking gun down, bitch!
"
19,10,Stan,"I'm gonna go tell Mom!
"
19,10,Randy,"Oh yeah? You go tell her! I'll tell her you had a gun! You'll be in more trouble than me!  Stan! I am your dad. Put the gun down and sit over there.
"
19,10,Stan,"Mom!
"
19,10,Randy,"Shit! 
"
19,10,Weathers,"Took a lot to hunt you down, PC Principal. You mind tellin' me why you're goin' around the world shootin' up revitalized arts and foods districts?
"
19,10,PC Principal,"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
"
19,10,Weathers,"Try me!
"
19,10,PC Principal,"I don't know what they are, but they used me and others like me to try and change this planet.
"
19,10,Weathers,"You don't know what ""who"" are?
"
19,10,Johnson,"Sir! The President is on the phone. He wants to talk to you about PC Principal. 
"
19,10,Weathers,"Yes, Mr. President? I see, sir. Yes, I understand.  We're to release him immediately, no questions asked. And we're not supposed to believe anything he tells us. 
"
19,10,PC Principal,"Huh, ain't that a peach?
"
19,10,Weathers,"He's being set free now, Mr. President. Can I tell the commander why?
"
19,10,Leslie,"This is a matter of national security. 
"
19,10,Weathers,"I understand, sir.
"
19,10,Leslie,"Thank you. God bless you.
"
19,10,Weathers,"God bless you too, sir.
"
19,10,Leslie,"May God bless the United States of America. 
"
19,10,Kyle,"Are you okay?
"
19,10,Leslie,"Yeah, just feeling butterflies. And my hands are freezing!
"
19,10,Kyle,"Here. 
"
19,10,Leslie,"Thank you, Kyle. 
"
19,10,Kyle,"Don't worry, Leslie. I won't let anything happen to you. 
"
19,10,Randy,"I'm warning you: you're on the wrong side of this! We're just trying to get answers!
"
19,10,Sharon,"You pulled a gun on our son, Randy!
"
19,10,Randy,"He pulled one on me first, Sharon!
"
19,10,Stan,"Because you wouldn't talk to me, Dad!
"
19,10,Randy,"Stanley, let your mother and I deal with this!
"
19,10,Sharon,"I told you to leave him alone!
"
19,10,Shelley,"God I hate this family!  Why are you always taking Stan's side?!
"
19,10,Randy,"Whoa! Whoa, Shelley! Put down the gun, Shelley!
"
19,10,Shelley,"You're always acting like Stan can't do anything wrong!
"
19,10,Stan,"She doesn't always take my side!
"
19,10,Shelley,"You shut up or I swear to God I'll use this!
"
19,10,Randy,"Shelley, put it down, now!
"
19,10,Shelley,"You don't even try to know me, Dad!
"
19,10,Randy,"I want to, Shelley! I just sometimes feel like you hate me!
"
19,10,Sharon,"I feel like you hate me, Randy!
"
19,10,Randy,"I don't hate you, I love you! I need to be a better husband,  a better father! 
"
19,10,Stan,"We all need to be better to each other! 
"
19,10,Shelley,"Okay, maybe I need to stop being so angry!
"
19,10,Randy,"I love you guys. 
"
19,10,Stan,"We love you too, Dad.  We just wanna know what's going on with you.
"
19,10,Randy,"Alright. I'll tell you everything.  Wow, these things are amazing. 
"
19,10,Jimbo,"Alright, Mrs. Farnicle, enjoy, and remember: if the safety's on, you're good as gone.  Okay, and next customer, please.  Hah, going for the big one, huh? You must be feeling extra jumpy.
"
19,10,Officer Barbrady,"You don't know the half of it.
"
19,10,Jimbo,"Well, this thing should make you feel more at ease. You know, you ought-ta check out the gun show.
"
19,10,Officer Barbrady,"The gun show?
"
19,10,Jimbo,"Yeah, it's gonna have everything! And with guns bein' so popular, practically everyone in town is gonna be in attendance!
"
19,10,Officer Barbrady,"The entire town in one location?  Oh my God!
"
19,10,Leslie,"The principal has become our biggest problem. We need a news headline that will draw him back to town.
"
19,10,Nathan,"Oh, you're gonna sponsor my content some more, baby? I'm all ears.
"
19,10,Jimmy,"I've got to get to the Super School News. Hey, Classi, you think you can get me my crutches?
"
19,10,Classi,"Mah, I don't think Nathan would like that.
"
19,10,Jimmy,"You seem like a reasonable person. Do you really wanna live in a world controlled by ads? I mean, come on, Classi.
"
19,10,Classi,"No. It's C-Lasssi, with an I. The little dick that hangs off the C fucks the L out of the ASS. CL-ASSSI.
"
19,10,Jimmy,"Sorry, my bad. Look, I'm a news reporter, Claaassi, and in a world where ads control the news, there's no way to be sure anyone is ever hearing the truth.
"
19,10,Classi,"Truth about what?
"
19,10,Leslie,"We can't just hide, Kyle. We have to let people know PC is the enemy before it's too late.
"
19,10,Kyle,"Leslie, we don't know who is on their side. We have to stay safe.
"
19,10,Leslie,"The principal is going to try and make up some crazy story. That's what PC people do. You have to get in front of everyone and tell them what you've learned.
"
19,10,Kyle,"I...  gave up giving speeches.
"
19,10,Leslie,"But why? I came to you because I had heard how good you were at getting messages across. That and because...  I thought you were cute.
"
19,10,Kyle,"I'm sure I'd have no problem giving a speech if you could be by my side.
"
19,10,Leslie,"Well... I can't go with you, you know. It's too dangerous.
"
19,10,Kyle,"Not if we go somewhere that's completely safe from any violence.
"
19,10,Leslie,"Where?
"
19,10,Kyle,"The gun show.
"
19,10,Leslie,"Gun show?
"
19,10,Kyle,"There'll be so many guns that nothing bad can happen.
"
19,10,Sharon,"Someone purposely had Principal Victoria replaced with a new principal?
"
19,10,Randy,"Yes. They wanted to use his PC as a means to start gentrification in our town.
"
19,10,Mr. Garrison,"That'w why we thought PC Principal was behind it. But now we know they were just using his PC abilities to service their own needs.
"
19,10,Randy,"When the pussy-crusher story came out in Super School News, it started to make PC Principal question himself. He started digging for answers. They didn't like that, so they tried to distract and mislead him. With this.  Sorry, that's an ad for McDonald's, hold on. With... this. Oh. N, oh, there's that ad again. God these things are annoying. Anyways, whatever these beings are, they try to keep anyone from knowing the truth from  Ugh, I don't wanna see a slideshow. PC Principal said something was trying to divert and distract his subconscious mind with this. 
"
19,10,Stan,"Wait... That's Leslie.  Oh my God... It's Kyle.
"
19,10,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle?
"
19,10,Stan,"Kyle has been protecting Leslie. They're together. He's been making everyone feel paranoid and saying you're the enemy, Dad.
"
19,10,Randy,"Well then, it's time to go ask Kyle why he sold out his own kind.
Principal Victoria:	How will we get him to talk?
"
19,10,Randy,"We're going to kill him with kindness. But instead of kindness we're going to use guns.
"
19,10,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah!
"
19,10,Stan,"Yeah!
"
19,10,Randy,"Come on, let's go!  Shelley, you take care of Grandpa!
"
19,10,Shelley,"Oooo-kay! 
"
19,10,Randy,"Nonono, don't shoot Grandpa, just literally take care of him. 
"
19,10,Caitlyn Jenner,"Buckle up, buckaroos! 
"
19,10,Nathan,"Here it is, Jimmy. Hot off the presses.
"
19,10,Jimmy,"What is that?
"
19,10,Nathan,"The newest edition of Super School News, hitting the streets tomorrow.
"
19,10,Jimmy,"Tragedy at gun show? What happened at the gun show?
"
19,10,Nathan,"Not what happened, what's going to happen. The final sweeping underneath the rug. By this time tomorrow nobody will be asking questions ever again. The ads will have won. And I will be... The man.
"
19,10,Classi,"I think the ads are playin' yo' ass.
"
19,10,Nathan,"Shut up Classiii!
"
19,10,Classi,"Oh heeelllllll no!
"
19,10,Nathan,"What?
"
19,10,Classi,"Oh hell no! Yo' Down's Symdrome ass just slapped me! I'mo break your dick off! 
"
19,10,Nathan,"Hang on, Classi, I'm sorry.

19,10,Classi,"I will bust yo' fuckin' ass!  I will bust yo' fuckin' nose. I ain't no Mimsy, asshole!  I'm a classy bitch!  And I do not!  Want ads!  Controllin' my news! 
"
19,10,Jimmy,"Classi! Thank you.
"
19,10,Classi,"You need my help? You got it!
"
19,10,Jimmy,"I need your phone to call Officer Barbrady. And we have to get to that gun show, fast!
"
19,10,Classi,"Quick! To the Classi mobile! 
"
19,10,Announcer,"Welcome back to the South Park Gun Show. We've had over 2000 gorgeous guns come through this arena today. It's been whittled down to seven, the winners from each group. David, take us down theh line. 
"
19,10,David,"First we have the beautiful Yorkshire 33mm with proud owner Stephen Stotch.
"
19,10,Announcer,"An absolutely gorgeous gun, David.
"
19,10,David,"The playful and lovely Australian semiautomatic owned by Father Maxi.
"
19,10,Announcer,"And there's the Mayor with her delightful Rhodesian ridgeback shotgun-rifle mix.
"
19,10,David,"That's a favorite of the crow here. Always a favorite at these shows.
"
19,10,Cartman,"That's a nice gun right there.
"
19,10,David,"The judge now asking to see that Yorkshire 33mm up close.
"
19,10,Announcer,"And there it is, just a beautiful gun in motion. Everybody loves it.  Looks like the judge wants to take another look at that shotgun-rifle mix. 
"
19,10,David,"And next up will be the-
"
19,10,Randy,"Nobody move! 
"
19,10,Mr. Garrison,"Everyone just stay where you are!
"
19,10,Announcer,"And it looks like the gun show is under attack, David. 
"
19,10,David,"Yes, six armed gunmen have entered the arena, one of which is carrying an absolutely gorgeous little Pekingese Glock 17.
"
19,10,Randy,"Listen to me, everyone! There are beings who are purposely gentrifying the Earth so that humans can no longer afford it! We've been looking for Kyle Broflovski! Somebody's hiding him! 
"
19,10,Kyle,"Don't listen to them! The real conspiracy here are the PC extremists who have no problem killing whoever doesn't think like they do!  You sun of a bitch Stan! How could you have sided with the enemy?!
"
19,10,Stan,"Fuck you, Kyle! You're the enemy!
"
19,10,Jimmy,"You both got it wrong. 
"
19,10,Kyle,"Jimmy?
"
19,10,Mr. Garrison,"Officer Barbrady?
"
19,10,Randy,"Classi?
"
19,10,Sharon,"Randy??
"
19,10,Jimmy,"Kyle, I know you probably thought Leslie was a kind, caring girl. But the truth is she's just an ad.
"
19,10,Randy,"An ad?
"
19,10,Officer Barbrady,"They've become sentient, They've taken human form. You can't tell what's human and what's an ad anymore.
"
19,10,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, Jeez, are you serious?! How am I supposed to fuck an ad to death?!
"
19,10,Randy,"Woah, flippin' ads! They're such a pain in the ass!
"
19,10,Kyle,"You told me Jimmy was dead.
"
19,10,Stan,"So now we know who got Principal Victoria fired!
"
19,10,Mr. Mackey,"Nobody move! Okay?! Everyone just stay where you are!
"
19,10,Randy,"Mackey?
"
19,10,Mr. Mackey,"Yes, I wanted Principal Victoria fired! But I didn't want any of this!
"
19,10,Principal Victoria,"You got me fired?! Why?!
"
19,10,Mr. Mackey,"Eighteen years of answerin' to you! EIGHTEEN YEARS! Of you always... tellin' me what to do!
"
19,10,Principal Victoria,"If you had problems with me, why didn't you just talk to me?
"
19,10,Mr. Mackey,"You never listen!! Nobody listens to me! They just expect me to listen to them!
"
19,10,Gerald,"Maybe we should have realized that sometimes the counselor needs counseling.
"
19,10,Mr. Mackey,"I don't know, maybe I got manipulated by these ads too somehow but, I should have been a better person!
"
19,10,Randy,"We all could be better people! All of us! We all played a part!
"
19,10,Stephen,"Maybe from now on people in this town need to communicate more! Care about each other!
"
19,10,Mr. Garrison,"If we're gonna defeat our enemies, that's what it's gonna take! All of us, together! 
"
19,10,Randy,"If only we'd had these before, huh?
"
19,10,Leslie,"Every time you block us, we get smarter. Every time you try to stop us, we are more. If one plan fails, we will plan another. You will never be rid of ads!
"
19,10,PC Principal,"HEY LESLIE!  Your species took PC and twisted it for evil purposes.  THAT PISSES ME OFF!  You're expelled. 
"
19,10,Cartman,"Yes, dude!
"
19,10,Randy,"Well, I guess there's just one last thing to take care of.
"
19,10,Randy,"Why did it have to be like this?! Why couldn't we try to live on this planet together?! Maybe we're not perfect beings, but we built a better town. We didn't need you to do that! And we'll keep on trying to make it better!
"
19,10,Sharon,"Randy, you're yelling at a Whole Foods.
"
19,10,Randy,"Go on, get outta here! We know! Others will know!  It isn't going to be so easy! Not anymore! 
"
19,10,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of all the hate speech and micro-aggressions against our species.  We have a new enemy out there. An almost invisible foe that is so bigoted, so racially biased they actually think we should all die.  They are trying to attract our youth using tactics that are underhanded and unfair.  But no matter how hard they hit us, we cannot let them take from us our PC. And so I have been asked to stay on as your principal. A lot of changes will happen in the coming months.  The bottom line is that the only thing that distinguishes those who want to kill us from those who don't is that we have the burning desire for social justice. We are at war, but the only way to win this war is to be as understanding, non-biased, and politically correct as possible.
"
19,10,Stan,"This is going to be really hard.
