2,1,Announcer 1,"Since the last South Park, you've waited four long weeks to find out who the father of Eric Cartman is. Now, finally, the shocking truth about Cartman's lineage... will not be seen tonight, so that we can bring you the following special presentation.
"
2,1,Announcer 2,"Now, get ready for Canada's hottest action stars,  Terrance and Phillip in HBC's Movie of the Week:  Not Without My Anus. Based on a true story.
"
2,1,Scott,"Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer.  That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance! 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Oh, Terrance! You farted in court!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense. 
"
2,1,Scott,"All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,  a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.
""Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in
with my new hammer""
Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God! J'accuse, Terrance!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?
"
2,1,Phillip,"Yes, please.
"
2,1,Terrance,"That's called a monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys!
"
2,1,Phillip,"The monkey claw is smelly.
"
2,1,Judge,"Come on, get a move on. I ain't gettin' any younger up here.
"
2,1,Phillip,"My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian.
"
2,1,Judge,"That is correct.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man. 
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument!
"
2,1,Phillip,"I have, haven't I, Terrance? 
"
2,1,Scott,"Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not! 
"
2,1,Judge,"Sustained.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?  Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.  Just kidding.  The defense rests! 
"
2,1,Scott,"Goddammit. That isn't funny!
"
2,1,Judge,"Madame Foreperson, have you reached a verdict so we can get the hell outta here?!
"
2,1,Madame Foreperson,"We have, Your Honor. We have found Terrance, in the above entitled action of murder against Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer--
"
2,1,Judge,"You're gonna have to repeat that verdict because we have some flatulence issues.
"
2,1,Madame Foreperson,"I said, we find--  We find Terrance--  Not guilty!
"
2,1,Phillip,"Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber. 
"
2,1,Terrance,"That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Hear hear!
"
2,1,Scott,"Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!
"
2,1,Phillip,"Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?
"
2,1,Scott,"There are hard feelings! This isn't over! I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done! And do you know why??
"
2,1,Phillip,"'Cause you're a dick?
"
2,1,Scott,"No! Because I hate you! You think farting is sooo funny! Well it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--  Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer! 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Cancer??
"
2,1,Scott,"Yes! In the head!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Head cancer??
"
2,1,Scott,"This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip. You'll rue this day! 
"
2,1,Terrance,"Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Yes, perhaps he's homophobic.
"
2,1,Terrance,"But we're not gay, Phillip.
"
2,1,Phillip,"We're not? 
"
2,1,Terrance,"Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner!
"
2,1,Phillip,"Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft dinner can calm my nerves.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.
"
2,1,Phillip,"He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.
"
2,1,Terrance,"God only knows.
"
2,1,Phillip,"The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance.
"
2,1,Terrance,"It sure is. Let's look for treasure.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Yes, let's look for treasure.
"
2,1,Scott,"Hello?
"
2,1,Voice,"Hello, Is this Scott, from Canada?
"
2,1,Scott,"Yess, yes it is.
"
2,1,Voice,"You're a Journalist, right?
"
2,1,Scott,"Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.
"
2,1,Voice,"I understand that you hate Terrance and Phillip. 
"
2,1,Scott,"Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!
"
2,1,Voice,"Well, what about I help you get rid of them once and for all?
"
2,1,Scott,"Who is this?
"
2,1,Voice,"Let's just say that I'm someone who can help you, if you help me.  Just call me your old pal, Saddam Hussein.
"
2,1,Scott,"Saddam Hussein?! The Iraqi dictator?
"
2,1,Saddam,"Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest!
"
2,1,Scott,"What do you want?
"
2,1,Saddam,"You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends into Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started.
"
2,1,Scott,"I'm not sure I should trust you.
"
2,1,Saddam,"Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me! 
"
2,1,Terrance,"Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip. 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob.
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip.
"
2,1,Terrance,"My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"How can you guys say stuff like that?
"
2,1,Terrance,"Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob.
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"I know, but--
"
2,1,Phillip,"Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver.
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside.
"
2,1,Terrance,"No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me? 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?
"
2,1,Terrance,"Yes.  If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you.
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"Thanks, you guys. 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Hello Barky. Hello Purry.
"
2,1,Barky,"Bark, bark.
"
2,1,Purry,"Purr, purr.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Say Terrance, I was just aboat to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some?
"
2,1,Terrance,"You know I never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip.  I'm going to put on a pirate costume. 
"
2,1,Delivery Man,"Special delivery for Terrance. 
"
2,1,Phillip,"I'll take that.
"
2,1,Delivery Man,"Sign here, and here, and here, and here, and here.  And here. 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Ooh, Terrannce!  You got a letterr!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Shiver me timbers, Phillip! At this rate I'll never get to my Kraft Dinner!  Oh my God!
"
2,1,Phillip,"What is it, Terrance? Did you fart?
"
2,1,Terrance,"No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally?! God, why?! Say, Terrance, who's Sally?
"
2,1,Terrance,"My daughter.
"
2,1,Phillip,"I never know you had a daughter, Terrance.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?
"
2,1,Phillip,"Nno, you never did, Terrance.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh. Well. It all began fif-teen years ago.
"
2,1,Phillip,"My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Yes, indeed.  But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran.  And I will have to go and find her.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Then I'll go with you, Terrance.
"
2,1,Terrance,"You're such a good friend, Phillip.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kraft Dinner.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Avast there, mateys!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Hello, Celine Dion.
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"Terrance! This is quite a surprise!
"
2,1,Terrance,"You're looking well.
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"And you.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Celine, where is our daughter, Sally?
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"She's in the Middle East, studying anthropology. Why?
"
2,1,Terrance,"Wrong! She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner.
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"What?!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return.
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"Oh, Terrance. What happened to us?
"
2,1,Terrance,"We just grew apart, Celine Dion. 
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"Please, bring our daughter home safe, Terrance. 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Hello, Ugly Bob.
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"Hi, guys.
"
2,1,Terrance,"How's the paper bag working out?
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please.
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there!
"
2,1,Phillip,"Dammit man!  Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!! 
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"All right, then. There's a flight leaving today.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance.
"
2,1,Terrance,"In-deed, Phillip.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kraft Dinner.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Same here, Phillip!
"
2,1,Phillip,"O Ca-nadaOur home and native land
"
2,1,Terrance/Phillip,"True patriot loveIn all thy sons' command
"
2,1,Small Group,"With glowing hearts we see thee rise
"
2,1,Middling Group,"The True North, strong and free
"
2,1,Larger Group,"From far and wide, O CanadaWe stand on guard for thee
"
2,1,Crowd,"God keep our land...
"
2,1,Scott,"Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon.
"
2,1,Saddam,"Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon.
"
2,1,Scott,"The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.
"
2,1,Saddam,"Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?
"
2,1,Scott,"Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
"
2,1,Saddam,"Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain.
"
2,1,Scott,"Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out.  I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers.
"
2,1,Terrance,"I Got Ya.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Burned your face.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Ow, that's rancid! hahahahaha.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Oh, look. There she is. .
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh, good. 
"
2,1,Sally,"Goo. Where?
"
2,1,Terrance,"I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance.  I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.
"
2,1,Sally,"Pa-pa.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance.  Oooh, now I see the resemblance!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Well, enough of Iran, let's get home. 
"
2,1,Terrance,"Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend.
"
2,1,Terrance,"No, you're gaining a pop vocalist.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Oh my God!  What is this?!  Is this Canada?
"
2,1,Terrance,"It seems to have changed.
"
2,1,Phillip,"This is madness!
"
2,1,Terrance,"What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?
"
2,1,Phillip,"I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?
"
2,1,Terrance,"I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"Terrance, ha, could you come back a little later?
"
2,1,Terrance,"Why?!
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"Ah, I'm just a little busy right now.
"
2,1,Terrance,"You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?!
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"Well, I... 
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"Hi guys.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!!
"
2,1,Terrance,"What the hell are you doing here?!
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like?
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"What do you mean? Why are you calling him ""Ugly Bob""?
"
2,1,Phillip,"Because that's his name, you stupid bitch!
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"You told me your name was Handsome Bob!!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Look at him, Celine Dion! 
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"Aaaaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhh!!!
"
2,1,Phillip,"Behold his horrible face!
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"Oh my God, he's hideously ugly! And I am pregnant with his child!
"
2,1,Terrance,"What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!!
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"I'm going to have a freak baby!!
"
2,1,Phillip,"Ohh, the humanity!!
"
2,1,Scott,"Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?
"
2,1,Saddam,"Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest.
"
2,1,Scott,"...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot!
"
2,1,Saddam,"Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran.
"
2,1,Scott,"I thought you were from Iraq.
"
2,1,Saddam,"Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Yes. I agree whole-fartedly. 
"
2,1,Scott,"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh, hello, Scott.
"
2,1,Scott,"You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--  Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?
"
2,1,Phillip,"Wait, what were you saying?
"
2,1,Scott,"Nothing, why?
"
2,1,Terrance,"Hey, Scott. Guess what?
"
2,1,Scott,"What?  Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both! 
"
2,1,Phillip,"What are you doing, Scott?
"
2,1,Scott,"I'm wishing cancer upon you.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Cancer?!!
"
2,1,Scott,"That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Ooh, stop that! 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Hey, don't give me cancer! 
"
2,1,U.S. Army Official,"Mr. Hussein, the U.S. Government is becoming worried.
"
2,1,Saddam,"Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax!
"
2,1,U.S. Army Official,"You seem to be... taking over Canada.
"
2,1,Saddam,"Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs.
"
2,1,U.S. Army Official,"We didn't say anything about bombs.
"
2,1,Saddam,"Oh. You didn't? Heeyy, relax!
"
2,1,U.S. Army Official,"We're giving you just three years to clear your forces out of Canada, and after that, we're gonna bomb all of Iran.
"
2,1,Saddam,"I'm from Iraq.
"
2,1,U.S. Army Official,"Iran, Iraq, what's the difference? 
"
2,1,Guard on Right,"Euugh. I hate Americans. Please, let me kill them!
"
2,1,Saddam,"No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world! 
"
2,1,Scott,"What's so funny!
"
2,1,Saddam,"Nothing! Relax, brother.
"
2,1,Scott,"Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!
"
2,1,Saddam,"Oh, really?
"
2,1,Scott,"You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!
"
2,1,Saddam,"I changed my mind!  Pray that I don't change it any further! 
"
2,1,Scott,"This deal's getting worse all the time.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Oh look. Here's a show. 
"
2,1,Woman 1,"...well fuck you.
"
2,1,Woman 2,"Arrrggghh! 
"
2,1,Springer,"And this is what life would be like...
"
2,1,Terrance,"It's so stupid!
"
2,1,Phillip,"Goddamn, their TV shows are lame! 
"
2,1,Mephesto,"The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-- 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Look at their silly American heads.
"
2,1,Terrance,"They look like groundhogs.
"
2,1,Cartman,"He's my father?! 
"
2,1,Anchor,"And in other news it appears that Saddam Hussein has finally signed an agreement to let the U.S. inspect his military operations. When asked if he would uphold his side of the agreement, Hussein replied, quote: ""Hey, relax, fella. You need a rest, guy.""
"
2,1,Terrance,"Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?
"
2,1,Phillip,"Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kraft Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks! 
"
2,1,Phillip,"That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance.
"
2,1,Terrance,"It sure did, Phillip.  Oh, wait. That is the phone.  Hello?
"
2,1,Scott,"Terrance, this is Scott.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh.  Hey, it's Scott. 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Tell him he's a smelly bastard.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Phillip says hello, Scott.
"
2,1,Scott,"Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer.
"
2,1,Terrance,"You are such a dick, Scott.
"
2,1,Scott,"You're a dick.
"
2,1,Terrance,"You're a dick.
"
2,1,Scott,"You're a dick.
"
2,1,Terrance,"You're a dick.
"
2,1,Scott,"You're a dick.
"
2,1,Terrance,"You're a dick.
"
2,1,Scott,"You're a dick.
"
2,1,Terrance,"You're a dick.
"
2,1,Scott,"The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada! You give other Canadians a bad name! And if I had my hair-
"
2,1,Terrance,"I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?
"
2,1,Scott,"Sure. 
"
2,1,Terrance,"How do you like that, Scott?!
"
2,1,Scott,"You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?
"
2,1,Scott,"Sure. 
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'
"
2,1,Scott,"Goddammit!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh, wait a second, Scott.
"
2,1,Scott,"Sure.  I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour! 
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"Oh, Ugly Bob, I'm so confused. I love your personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly. 
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"We can only hope. I suppose we'll be okay as long as you keep that bag on your head.  What's this?! 
"
2,1,Saddam,"He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion.
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch.
"
2,1,Saddam,"Eh! Who are you?
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"I'm Bob. But my friends call me Ugly Bob, because I have the features of a deformed burn victim.
"
2,1,Saddam,"Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.  Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours. 
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"You can?
"
2,1,Saddam,"Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"What?! Why?!
"
2,1,Saddam,"Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it! Look over here! ...All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"Did you say, ""hostile takeover of Canada""?
"
2,1,Saddam,"No, no, relax there, fella! 
"
2,1,Terrance,"Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up! 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure. 
"
2,1,Scott,"What are you idiots doing?!
"
2,1,Terrance,"We're looking for treasure!
"
2,1,Scott,"Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?
"
2,1,Phillip,"No, we're searching for treasure.
"
2,1,Scott,"Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.
"
2,1,Scott,"Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?
"
2,1,Phillip,"What do you mean?
"
2,1,Scott,"It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter! 
"
2,1,Phillip,"You mean, we are to blame?!
"
2,1,Scott,"That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this. 
"
2,1,Phillip,"What is this? 
"
2,1,Scott,"It's a bomb.  You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions.
"
2,1,Terrance,"That plan's scary!
"
2,1,Scott,"Well, you must do it for Canada.
"
2,1,Phillip,"For Canada, Terrance. 
"
2,1,Terrance,"For Canada, Phillip. 
"
2,1,Scott,"Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life. 
"
2,1,Terrance,"That's funny!
"
2,1,Phillip,"Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.
"
2,1,Terrance,"Why is that?
"
2,1,Phillip,"That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?
"
2,1,Terrance,"Yes. Apparently, he does.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.
"
2,1,Phillip,"I do, Terrance. 
"
2,1,Announcer,"And the Roughriders are giving the Roughriders a run for their money!  All else aside, I must say that the Roughriders  are simply outmatched by these Roughriders  And that's going to take us to halftime. Be sure to stick around for the halftime show: Saddam and the Electric Iraqis in a salute to hostile takeovers!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Well, I guess it's time, old friend.
"
2,1,Phillip,"Yes. Prepare the alert!
"
2,1,Saddam,"Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.  You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as New Baghdad! Qoloh Qalah!  You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!  And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem!  Or you will be stabbed in the head!
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht...
"
2,1,Terrance,"Now, Phlllip?
"
2,1,Phlllip,"Now, Terrance. 
"
2,1,Saddam,"Hey!! What the hell is this?! 
"
2,1,Celine,"Freh kashu kaliakaliakatchut...
"
2,1,Guard,"They're using chemical warfare! How could they?!
"
2,1,Terrance,"We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!
"
2,1,Phillip,"Oh, Glorious Day!
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"Phillip, Terrance! You've saved Canada!
"
2,1,Terrance,"Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea. 
"
2,1,Ugly Bob,"God bless you, Phillip. 
"
2,1,Phillip,"Don't touch me, Ugly Bob!
"
2,1,Scott,"Hey! What the hell happened! You were supposed to be blown up!
"
2,1,Phillip,"We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada!
"
2,1,Scott,"Oh! That is so juvenile! 
"
2,1,Terrance,"Hey, Scott, you like apples?
"
2,1,Scott,"Of course!
"
2,1,Terrance,"How do you like them apples? 
"
2,1,Scott,"I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!! 
"
2,1,Terrance,"Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
"
2,1,Celine Dion,"You're right, Terrance. You're right.  
O Canada, our home and native land
"
2,1,"Celine, Terrance, Bob, Phillip, and people on the field","True patriot love in all thy sons command
"
2,1,Crowd,"With glowing hearts we see thee rise, the True North, strong and free 
"
2,1,Crowd outside,"From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee
God keep our land glorious and free
Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee
Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee
"
2,1,Announcer 1,"Who is Eric Cartman's father? Find out on an all new South Park, in just a few weeks.
"
2,2,Announcer 2,"Previously, on South Park: an air of sobriety fills the laboratory as the men of South Park gather to find out which one of them fathered this boy. 
"
2,2,Announcer 1,"Who is Eric Cartman's father? At the end of this episode, you will know the answer.
"
2,2,Mephesto,"And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room.
"
2,2,Cartman,"Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.
"
2,2,Stan,"Oooh- hey, Kenny.
"
2,2,Mephesto,"Gentlemen, the father is... 
"
2,2,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, what the hell's going on?
"
2,2,Jimbo,"It's a power outage!
"
2,2,Chef,"Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
"
2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Oh my God, look! 
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)
"
2,2,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
2,2,Mr. Garrison,"Mephesto's been shot. 
"
2,2,Chef,"Is he ...dead?
"
2,2,Jimbo,"Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!
"
2,2,Mr. Garrison,"Then who was it?
"
2,2,Announcer 1,"Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it--
"
2,2,Cartman,"Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
"
2,2,Announcer 1,"Or was it Sheila Broflovski?
"
2,2,Chef,"Waait!  He's still breathin'! He's not dead.
"
2,2,Cartman,"Goddammit! Who's my father?
"
2,2,Chef,"We've got to get him to the hospital.
"
2,2,Cartman,"You've got to be kidding me!
"
2,2,Chef,"Come on, children! 
"
2,2,Cartman,"Eeeehh..!
"
2,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell for him going through all this. 
"
2,2,Jimbo,"There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
"
2,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
"
2,2,Announcer 1,"Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos?
"
2,2,Cartman,"Is he awake yet?
"
2,2,Kyle,"He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
"
2,2,Chef,"Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
"
2,2,Kyle,"What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
"
2,2,Chef,"I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to...  Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?
"
2,2,Stan,"Could you pull over so I can get out?
"
2,2,Chef,"What? We have to get to the hospital.
"
2,2,Stan,"I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
"
2,2,Chef,"Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?
"
2,2,Kyle,"Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.
"
2,2,Cartman,"They can't. Mephesto can't die.
"
2,2,Kyle,"Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
"
2,2,Cartman,"No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, ""Come Sail Away"", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.
"
2,2,Kyle,"Really?
"
2,2,Cartman,"Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
"
2,2,Kyle,"I'm sailing away
"
2,2,Cartman,"No! Don't!
"
2,2,Kyle,"Set an open course for the virgin sea...
"
2,2,Cartman,"Eh-- 
For I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay
A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to us this song of hope
And this is what they said
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
"
2,2,Kyle,"Whoa, dude!
"
2,2,Jimbo,"What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!
"
2,2,Sheila,"We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
"
2,2,Sharon,"Uh... Where are our children? 
"
2,2,Mayor,"Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?
"
2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Mayor! Mayor!
"
2,2,Mayor,"The press is here.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.
"
2,2,Mayor,"Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"We're desperate for stories.  A-and this one is so compelling.
"
2,2,Mayor,"Really??
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
"
2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Hey, I thought of something.  Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction.
"
2,2,Mayor,"Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?
"
2,2,Jimbo,"Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--
"
2,2,Mayor,"Shh.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins.
"
2,2,Mayor,"Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family.
"
2,2,Cameraman,"It is?
"
2,2,Mayor,"Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay! 
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
"
2,2,Announcer 1,"Who will the director cast first? Will it be Mr. Garrison? Officer Barbrady? Chef?
"
2,2,Liane,"I want to have... an abortion.
"
2,2,Receptionist,"Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs...
"
2,2,Liane,"Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.
"
2,2,Receptionist,"Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?
"
2,2,Liane,"About eight years ago.
"
2,2,Receptionist,"...I sseee, so the fetus is...
"
2,2,Liane,"Eight years old.
"
2,2,Receptionist,"Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion.
"
2,2,Liane,"Really?
"
2,2,Receptionist,"Yes, this is what we would refer to as the ""fortieth trimester"".
"
2,2,Liane,"But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
"
2,2,Receptionist,"Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester.
"
2,2,Liane,"Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.
"
2,2,Receptionist,"Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman.
"
2,2,Liane,"Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day! 
"
2,2,Chef,"Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor! 
"
2,2,Stan,"Ugh. I can't do it, dude. 
"
2,2,Kyle,"Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
"
2,2,Cartman,"Yeah, stop being a wuss!
"
2,2,Chef,"Doctor!
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat! 
"
2,2,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son. 
"
2,2,Chef,"Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle.
"
2,2,Stan,"Oh man.  I'm gonna be sick.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of. 
"
2,2,Stan,"Oogh.
"
2,2,Nurse,"Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone.
"
2,2,Stan,"Ooooogh.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside.  Oops, he's hemorrhaging. 
"
2,2,Stan,"Aghh!
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Ooo! His head fell off.
"
2,2,Stan,"I'm gotta get outta here!
"
2,2,Kyle,"Stan!
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach.
"
2,2,Mephesto Tryout,"And the father of Eric Cartman is... Bang! Oh, Jiminy! I've been shot! 
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you.  I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Misteruhh Garrison.
"
2,2,Assistant,"Call the Mr. Garrison auditions!
"
2,2,Garrison 1,"Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
"
2,2,Mr. Hat 1,"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!
"
2,2,Mr. Garrison,"I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
"
2,2,Mr. Hat,"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Thank you! Next!
"
2,2,Mr. Garrison,"What?
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Next! 
"
2,2,Garrison 2,"I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
"
2,2,Mr. Hat 2,"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs! 
"
2,2,Liane,"...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.
"
2,2,O'Reilly,"Well, all I know is that third-trimester abortions are illegal. I don't really know anything about 40th.
"
2,2,Liane,"But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
"
2,2,O'Reilly,"No- No, I think youah gotta talk to the governor about that stuff.
"
2,2,Liane,"Oh, dear.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Well, this is about all I can do for him.
"
2,2,Cartman,"Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Sorry, son, it might be a while.
"
2,2,Cartman,"Wake up, you son of a bitch!
"
2,2,Chef,"Whoa!
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition.
"
2,2,Cartman,"I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
"
2,2,Kyle,"Hey, Cartman.
"
2,2,Cartman,"What?
"
2,2,Kyle,"I'm sailing ay...
"
2,2,Cartman,"--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard...
"
2,2,Stan,"Okay okay, let's get outta here now! 
"
2,2,Kyle,"I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"My God, that's a hell of a storm. 
"
2,2,Stan,"Oh, weak. 
"
2,2,Cartman,"...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--
"
2,2,Greenfield,"God, I hate mountains.  This better not push back our shooting schedule.  Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it.  Who's that?
"
2,2,Assistant,"Oh, that's TV's Eric Roberts. We were able to ge him to play the part of the little monkey guy.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Whoa. Talk about ""all washed-up"", huh? Great to have you, Eric!  Here we go, aaand action.
"
2,2,Mephesto Actor,"I want to announce who the father is.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Bang!!
"
2,2,Mephesto Actor,"Oh, I've been shot! 
"
2,2,Barbrady Actor,"Nobody move! I'm a law officer!
"
2,2,Chef Actor,"My God, I think he's gone into cardiac arrest!
"
2,2,Mephesto Actor,"Whoaw..!
"
2,2,Barbrady Actor,"You seem somewhat unnerved by this, Chef.
"
2,2,Chef Actor,"Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because if you are accusing me, don't hide behind your clever riddles!
"
2,2,Barbrady Actor,"Our differences must be set aside for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man, a man trying to do my job.
"
2,2,Barbrady,"Whoa, this is a good movie!
"
2,2,Cartman,"Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee
"
2,2,Stan,"Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
"
2,2,Blonde,"Doctor, I can't focus!
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly. 
"
2,2,Chef,"Wait a second. They've closed the pass??
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked.  Metaphorically speaking, that is.
"
2,2,Cartman,"What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out.  Oof. Who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh?
"
2,2,Voice-over,"Tonight, on America's Most Wanted, a shooter is on the loose in Colorado, and its residents are up in arms! Here's your hose, John Walsh.
"
2,2,John Walsh,"Good evening and welcome to America's Most Wanted. Tonight: terror invaded the small mountain community of South Park, Colorado, when Dr. Alphonse Mephesto  was gunned down in his laboratory. America's Most Wanted has reconstructued this heinous crime  in hopes that your calls could help solve the case. 
"
2,2,Mephesto Actor,"I've been shot!
"
2,2,Garrison Actor,"My God, Mr. Hat! Get some help!
"
2,2,Mr. Hat Actor (!),"Right away, Mr. Garrison.
"
2,2,Eric Roberts (as Kevin!),"No, no! My lifetime partner and friend, gone, taken away in the wink of an eye. O, Fortune, why do you mock me?
"
2,2,Greenfield,"What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!
"
2,2,Chef Actor,"I'm going to get the man to a hospital. Who will help me?
"
2,2,Eric Roberts,"This is not a world I want to live in! Doesn't anyone want--
"
2,2,Greenfield,"God-dammit!  What the hell is this?!
"
2,2,Cameraman,"We've lost the feed to L.A.
"
2,2,John Walsh,"Uuuhm... We-we seem to have lost our linkup to the South Park crew, sso I guess we'll be going to our featured movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
"
2,2,Announcer 1,"Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo? Mr. Garrison? Chef?
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Somebody go see why we lost the hookup! 
"
2,2,Jimbo,"Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!
"
2,2,Nurse Goodly,"Don't panic, anybody. The power lines are down, but the backup generator is running just fine.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Nurse, I could use some help in here!
"
2,2,Goodly,"Coming! 
"
2,2,Cartman,"Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
"
2,2,Goodly,"Yes, for now. But I'm afraid the generator won't run for long. The batteries run out in half an hour. Time is very short.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!  Oh, sorry.
"
2,2,Liane,"Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.
"
2,2,Governor,"Mmaarr. I don't know-uh, I might need some more convincing, hm-hm-hm. 
"
2,2,Liane,"I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly.
"
2,2,Chef,"What do you want me to do?
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Do you know anything about surgery?
"
2,2,Chef,"I used to watch Quincy.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives.
"
2,2,Stan,"No way, dude!
"
2,2,Jimbo,"Well,  we're not going anywhere for a loong time.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"We're snowed in?
"
2,2,Mayor,"Yes. We're trapped!
"
2,2,Garrison,"Like sailors on a submarine.
"
2,2,Mayor,"My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen.
"
2,2,Assistant,"Oh I have to get out of here, I haven't eaten since breakfast.
"
2,2,Barbrady,"Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too. 
"
2,2,Jimbo,"I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.  Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive. 
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?
"
2,2,Jimbo,"That's a lot of lead, Mr. Director. I don't eat pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it.
"
2,2,Mayor,"Buut, how do we decide ""who""?
"
2,2,Jimbo,"Well, we draw straws.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?
"
2,2,Jimbo,"Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?
"
2,2,Announcer 1,"Who the hell made Jimbo boss? Was it Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Gar--
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me.  Nurse Goodly will take care of the anesthesia. Chef, you act as her arms.  Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready?
"
2,2,Stan,"No.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart.
"
2,2,Stan,"Oh boy.  Bleech! 
"
2,2,Kyle,"Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
"
2,2,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Suction! 
"
2,2,Cartman,"Hey, who's screwing with the lights?
"
2,2,Announcer 1,"Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos?
"
2,2,Cartman,"That is really starting to piss me off.
"
2,2,Jimbo,"Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing.  Whew.
"
2,2,Garrison,"Whew.
"
2,2,Barbrady,"Wooo!
"
2,2,Jimbo,"Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
"
2,2,Barbrady,"The short what?
"
2,2,Jimbo,"Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!
"
2,2,Barbrady,"That's not how I played it!
"
2,2,Garrison,"Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital.
"
2,2,Chef,"So how do we get to it?
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny.  Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct.  Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here  where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here.  Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?
"
2,2,Cartman,"Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Huh?)
"
2,2,Garrison,"I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...
"
2,2,Mayor,"We're all going to die in this horrible place. 
"
2,2,Jimbo,"We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"How can we? How could we live with ourselves?
"
2,2,Jimbo,"There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts. 
"
2,2,Mayor,"Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts.
"
2,2,Garrison,"Eat Eric Roberts! 
"
2,2,Eric Roberts,"No! No, please!
"
2,2,Mayor,"Well, there's no going back now.  We're cannibals.  God save us.
"
2,2,Jimbo,"God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight! 
"
2,2,Assistant,"Well I have to admit, Eric Roberts was much juicier than I expected.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"Aaww.
"
2,2,Garrison,"This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna die here, I know it.
"
2,2,Jimbo,"What time is it, Barbrady?
"
2,2,Barbrady,"It's almost midnight.
"
2,2,Garrison,"Oh! I can't... go on. 
"
2,2,Jimbo,"We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.
"
2,2,Greenfield,"What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Team B? Come in, Team B.
"
2,2,Kenny,"(This is Team B.)
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage.
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left.
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Yup! I see it in the drift.)
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Good. Head towards it. Team A out.
"
2,2,Cartman,"What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?
"
2,2,Mayor,"My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.
"
2,2,Jimbo,"It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who.
"
2,2,Announcer 1,"Who built the pyramids? Was it the Babylonians? Officer Barbrady? Samaritans?
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Okay, I've reached the generator)
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Roger, Team B.  He's reached the backup generator.  Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Roger.)
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Negative.)
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed.
"
2,2,Kyle,"D'you have any wire here?
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!
"
2,2,Kenny,"(I'll stick 'em together)
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands.
"
2,2,Kyle,"No, he'll die!
"
2,2,Cartman,"Go, Kenny!
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Kenny! Nnnoooooo!
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)
"
2,2,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2,2,Kyle,"You bastard! 
"
2,2,Chef,"The power! 
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Quickly! Get the scanner running again!  We've got a chance now!
"
2,2,Clinton,"Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you.
"
2,2,Liane,"Oh, thank you, thank you.
"
2,2,Clinton,"We'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately. 
"
2,2,Liane,"Terminated?
"
2,2,Clinton,"Why yes, that's what an abortion is.
"
2,2,Liane,"Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
"
2,2,Clinton,"Adoption?
"
2,2,Liane,"Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption.
"
2,2,Clinton,"Well, that's- pretty different.
"
2,2,Liane,"Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President. 
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine.
"
2,2,Mephesto,"Where... where am I?
"
2,2,Chef,"You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--
"
2,2,Mephesto,"Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.
"
2,2,Chef,"Ooohhh.
"
2,2,Dr. Doctor,"Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.
"
2,2,Chef,"He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.
"
2,2,Stan,"He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
"
2,2,Kyle,"He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
"
2,2,Cartman,"Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop. 
"
2,2,Stan,"Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
"
2,2,Kyle,"I don't know. Let's find out.
"
2,2,Garrison,"Ohh. It's over! We're free!
"
2,2,Barbrady,"Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?
"
2,2,Jimbo,"Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.
"
2,2,Mayor,"But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
"
2,2,Ned,"Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time.
"
2,2,Singer,"Ave Maria... 
"
2,2,Garrison,"Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?
"
2,2,Mephesto,"I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--
"
2,2,Cartman,"Just tell us already!
"
2,2,Mephesto,"Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--
"
2,2,Cartman,"Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
"
2,2,Mephesto,"Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman. 
"
2,2,Chef,"What???
"
2,2,Liane,"Yes, it's true.
"
2,2,Garrison,"Noo, that doesn't make sense!
"
2,2,Mephesto,"Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite. 
"
2,2,Garrison,"Uh-meaning what?
"
2,2,Mephesto,"Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.
"
2,2,Liane,"It's true.
"
2,2,Chef,"You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!
"
2,2,Mephesto,"No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis.  The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance.
"
2,2,Cartman,"Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.
"
2,2,Stan,"Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
"
2,2,Liane,"I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.  I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.
"
2,2,Cartman,"Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!
"
2,2,Mephesto,"Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing.
"
2,2,Cartman,"No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!
"
2,2,Announcer 1,"Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?
"
2,2,Cartman,"Ooohhh, forget it! 
"
2,3,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Reading sucks ass.
"
2,3,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, shut up! 
"
2,3,Kyle,"Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
"
2,3,Stan,"Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.
"
2,3,Kyle,"Wow, these books look cool!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.
"
2,3,Kenny,"(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"Hello, kids. I see you're discovering the magic of reading. 
"
2,3,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"I drive the Booktastic bus, where magic begins. You see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. You can take a canoe down the Amazon or go back in time to Camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. Just like magic. The magic of reading.
"
2,3,Cartman,"God, shut up, dude.
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"Go ahead and pick any books you like. Then give in. Give in to the magic. 
"
2,3,Stan,"If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
"
2,3,Kyle,"Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical. 
"
2,3,Cartman,"I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these. 
"
2,3,Kenny,"(Hey, what's that?)
"
2,3,Stan,"I don't know. Let's go see. 
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong.
"
2,3,Dispatcher 1,"All units. All units. Report to 254 Avenue de los Mexicanos. Possible hostile situation.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no podunk little town!
"
2,3,Dispatcher,"And, Barbrady, your wife called. She wants you to get some pizza on the way home.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Goddammit!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here.  What's the trouble? Where's the body?
"
2,3,Rancher,"Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens. 
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Uhhhh... oh. 
"
2,3,Woman,"My God, that's disgusting!
"
2,3,Stan,"Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see.  Did you get a good look at the suspect?
"
2,3,Rancher,"Naw, I didn't see anything. It just happened so fast.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?
"
2,3,Cameraman,"Uhh, we're gonna go grab some lunch and maybe get some shots of those turtles down at the pond. 
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Haw, camel poo.
"
2,3,Stan,"Hey, what's this? 
"
2,3,Kyle,"It looks like a note.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Give me that!  That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!
"
2,3,Rancher,"What does it say?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Uhh... It says, uuh, ""Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye."" Well, there you have it. Case closed.
"
2,3,Rancher,"Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say ""Nothin' to see here"", and ""Case closed."" But we want justice. We have to find this sicko!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people.
"
2,3,Rancher,"For what? Orderly conduct?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"How about fishing without a license?
"
2,3,Rancher,"I'm not fishin'.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Whataya call this then?  If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you  by gunshot to the head.  That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget.  For-get.
"
2,3,Kyle,"Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
"
2,3,Stan,"Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.
"
2,3,Teller,"Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you?  Sir, can I help you?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers.
"
2,3,Teller,"Sure, there's just one problem.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"What's that?
"
2,3,Teller,"We're a bank. 
"
2,3,Barbrady,"I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?
"
2,3,Teller,"Yes.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Hmmm.  I can't go on living this lie!
"
2,3,Anchor,"With chicken after chicken being violated, the South Park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the Chickenfucker. We now go live to a press conference where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are fielding questions.
"
2,3,Reporter 1,"Officer Barbrady, what would drive a man to such a disgusting act?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established.
"
2,3,Reporter 2,"Do the police have any leads?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet.
"
2,3,Reporter 3,"But has Chickenfucker left any clues at the crime?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"All right, all right! I can't read!  There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire! 
"
2,3,Press Coordinator,"Okay, thank you all for coming. There's uhh, coffee and brownies out front.
"
2,3,Anchor,"And so Officer Barbrady has taken a leave of absence, and South Park would have to manage without any police force for a while--  This just in! South Park is plunged into total anarchy!  Exactly two seconds after the retirement of Officer Barbrady, looting and pillaging erupted in the quiet mountain town! 
"
2,3,Looter 1,"Whoopee, this is killer!
"
2,3,Looter 2,"With no cops around, we can do whatever we want!
"
2,3,Kyle,"Whoa, dude, what's going on?
"
2,3,Stan,"I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.
"
2,3,Mayor,"I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful.
"
2,3,Aide 1,"Who knew? I always thought he was a complete idiot.
"
2,3,Mayor,"He is. 
"
2,3,Reporter 3,"What do you plan to do about the South Park riots?
"
2,3,Mayor,"No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.
"
2,3,Reporter 3,"But he's illiterate. What do you plan to do?
"
2,3,Mayor,"Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh--
"
2,3,Aide 2,"Reading classes, plain and simple. By the mayor's order, Officer Barbrady is on temporary leave of absence to learn to read, effective immediately.
"
2,3,Mayor,"Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady! 
"
2,3,Garrison,"Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady. 
"
2,3,Stan,"I can't see, dude!
"
2,3,Garrison,"Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics.  E-yes, what is it?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"I need to go poopies.
"
2,3,Garrison,"Officer Barbrady, in school we go to the bathroom before and after class.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?
"
2,3,Garrison,"Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?
"
2,3,Kyle,"How about a brain transplant? 
"
2,3,Garrison,"Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it.  Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Ahhh... O... O--
"
2,3,Garrison,"Bzzzt! Wrong! Try again, dumbass! Hahahahahahaha  hahahaha!  Okay, okay. Maybe we should try something a little easier. We can work our way up to the hard ones.  Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Ahhh... O...
"
2,3,Garrison,"Bzzzt drrrrr! Did you hear that, Mr. Hat?
"
2,3,Mr. Hat,"I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard! 
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?
"
2,3,Stan,"No, we just fake it to shut him up.
"
2,3,Garrison,"Okayheh, okay hi'm sohry. I'm sohry heh. Let's try again.
"
2,3,Intruder,"So, what are nice chickens like you doing in a coop like this? 
"
2,3,Garrison,"Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports.  Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see...
"
2,3,Cartman,"Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?
"
2,3,Garrison,"Eric, why don't you go first?
"
2,3,Cartman,"Oooaaagh.
"
2,3,Garrison,"What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again?
"
2,3,Cartman,"I'm prepared!  For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?
"
2,3,Garrison,"No, I can't say that I have.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.
"
2,3,Garrison,"And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down!
"
2,3,Cartman,"God-dammit! 
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Haa haa. Ha ha ha.
"
2,3,Garrison,"Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: ""Big... dog..., little... dog.  A red dog... on a..."" Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.
"
2,3,Garrison,"Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Hooray!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Goody two-shoes.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
""Whoosh!"" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes
"
2,3,Stan,"Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
"
2,3,Kyle,"Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go...
"
2,3,Mayor,"Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?! 
"
2,3,Kenny,"(Daaarrrggghh--)  (-ooggghhh...)
"
2,3,Stan,"Oh, my God! They've killed--
"
2,3,Kenny,"(Hey.)
"
2,3,Stan,"Oh, never mind. 
"
2,3,Mayor,"Well, how's the reading coming along?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Oooh, pretty good.
"
2,3,Mayor,"Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night.
"
2,3,Kyle,"Oh no! 
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover.
"
2,3,Aide 2,"This time he made love to Carla Weathers' prize chicken. She's catatonic.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?
"
2,3,Mayor,"The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene. 
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's.
"
2,3,Mayor,"You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
"
2,3,Mayor,"Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever! 
"
2,3,Aide 2,"Hey, what'd you do that for?
"
2,3,Aide 1,"Uh, just dramatic effect, sorry. 
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Oh boy, I'm in big trouble.  I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos.
"
2,3,Stan,"It's cool, dude. We'll help you.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Really? I wanna be a cop.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset. 
"
2,3,Cartman,"Do I get a nightstick?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Sure, nightsticks for everybody!  You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case.
"
2,3,Cartman,"10-4, sergeant! 
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Now, what did that clue say again?
"
2,3,Stan,"""If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft"".
"
2,3,Barbrady,"To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!
"
2,3,"Stan, Kyle, Kenny","Hooray!
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"Good day, friends. Welcome to the magical world of reading.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"We need a copy of Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft right away!
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"Oohhh, that's a very magical book, full of wondrous--
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake! 
"
2,3,Kyle,"What's it say?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"It says, ""Mmmuh mmmuuh..."" Uh, what's this word? 
"
2,3,Stan,"I.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Oh, yeah. ""I... mmuh mmuh--""
"
2,3,Kyle,"Here, give me that.  ""I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond.""
"
2,3,Stan,"A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Ey! 
"
2,3,Randy,"Uhh, yes, Officer?
"
2,3,Cartman,"I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
"
2,3,Randy,"Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. 
"
2,3,Cartman,"Step out of the car, please, sir.
"
2,3,Randy,"Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
"
2,3,Cartman,"Sir, step out of the car, please.
"
2,3,Randy,"Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!
"
2,3,Randy,"Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.  Ow!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Get your ass to jail! 
"
2,3,Randy,"Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
2,3,Randy,"Ooww!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Oh, weak, dude! We're too late!
"
2,3,Stan,"Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
"
2,3,Priest,"Well, this is terrible! Now, who would have sex with a chicken?
"
2,3,Halfy,"I would. 
"
2,3,Garrison,"Aw, you couldn't screw anything, Halfy. You don't have any legs!
"
2,3,Halfy,"Oh... yeah. 
"
2,3,Priest,"Have some respect for people's feelings, would you, Halfy?!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.
"
2,3,Kyle,"Here! Here, I found one!
"
2,3,Stan,"What's it say? What's it say?
"
2,3,Kyle,"It says, ""Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--"" What's this word?
"
2,3,Stan,"I dunno.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"""Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist.""  I read it! I read it all by myself! 
"
2,3,Halfy,"Hooray, yeah! Whoo!
"
2,3,Dispatcher 2,"Five George is en route to 496 Broad Wasteland...
"
2,3,Cartman,"Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you.  Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them. 
"
2,3,Driver,"Hi there, little lady.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Well, hi there.  Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?
"
2,3,Driver,"Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?
"
2,3,Cartman,"Sir, step out of the car, please.
"
2,3,Driver,"What? Oh-oh-uh, is this a bust?
"
2,3,Cartman,"Sir, step out of the car.
"
2,3,Driver,"Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah. 
"
2,3,Driver,"Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.
"
2,3,Looter 3,"I got a TV.
"
2,3,Looter 4,"Shh. Come on!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"""Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..."" Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!
"
2,3,Kyle,"How's it goin', dude?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo.
"
2,3,Stan,"Come on, dude, it's not that hard!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"It is, too!
"
2,3,Kyle,"Just read the sentence.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"""Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--""
"
2,3,Kyle,"Come on, dumbass, you can do it!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"""Pet--"" Wait a minute. 
"
2,3,Garrison,"Conjugate the verb. Conjugate the verb.
"
2,3,Mr. Hat,"Yes, conjugate the verb.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!
"
2,3,Dispatcher 3,"All units, all units. Five-twelve at 635 Avenue de los Mexicanos; request assistance. 
"
2,3,Cartman,"Sir, could you step out of the car, please?
"
2,3,Stuart,"We're fine, officer. 
"
2,3,Cartman,"And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?
"
2,3,Stuart,"Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids-- 
"
2,3,Kenny,"(Hi, Cartman.)
"
2,3,Stuart,"--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Poor people tend to live in clusters.
"
2,3,Stuart,"What—What did you say?
"
2,3,Cartman,"Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a...
"
2,3,Mrs. McCormick,"I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!
"
2,3,Stuart,"Shut up, bitch!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh.
"
2,3,Mrs. McCormick,"You lazy-ass motherfucker!
"
2,3,Stuart,"Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.
"
2,3,Mrs. McCormick,"I'll do it again! 
"
2,3,Kevin,"Mom hit Dad again! 
"
2,3,Cartman,"Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah! 
"
2,3,Kenny,"(Goddammit, Cartman!)
"
2,3,Stuart,"Aagh!
"
2,3,Dispatcher 1,"All units. All units. We have a 5-20 on the suspect. Report to the South Park petting zoo immediately!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Chickenlover!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute. 
"
2,3,Stan,"Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
"
2,3,Kyle,"Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Oh, no!  Shhh!  Keep your eyes peeled. 
"
2,3,Stan,"Look! 
"
2,3,Kyle,"He's here!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Grab him! 
"
2,3,Cartman,"Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?! 
"
2,3,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed--
"
2,3,Kenny,"(Oh, it was only my jacket.)
"
2,3,Stan,"Goddammit!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!
"
2,3,Stan,"Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Oh. 
"
2,3,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Caught you red-handed!
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"Indeed, you did. How did you know I would strike here?
"
2,3,Barbrady,"By reading Teetle the Timid Taxidermist.
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"You did?! Really?! Then it worked! My whole plan worked absolutely perfectly! 
"
2,3,Stan,"What are you talking about, dude?!
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!
"
2,3,Kyle,"So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"Yes! Yes, exactly! Don't you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate.
"
2,3,Stan,"That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"Oh, no? He who was blind can now see!  I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Well, I guess I should say ""Thanks?""
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"You're welcome. And now, my reading friend, you've proven that you are ready for the big time. I give you this hardback copy of Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Freeze! Put your hands in the air!
"
2,3,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
2,3,Cartman,"I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
"
2,3,Kyle,"Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
"
2,3,Cartman,"A-ha! 
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"Ow, that hurts!
"
2,3,Kyle,"Whoa, dude!
"
2,3,Stan,"Cartman!
"
2,3,Babrady,"No, no, that's not how you uphold the law! 
"
2,3,Cartman,"Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!
"
2,3,Babrady,"Oohhh, ohh, you've got it all wrong, my little friend. You do it like this: 
"
2,3,Bus Driver,"Heee--!
"
2,3,Babrady,"You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Ooohhhh.
"
2,3,Kyle,"I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
"
2,3,Babrady,"Well anyway, I'm relieving you of your duties. I've proved that I can read, and now I'm back on the job! 
"
2,3,Stan/Kyle,"Hooray! 
"
2,3,Stan,"Hey! So what are you going to do now?
"
2,3,Babrady,"Now?  Well, I-ee uh... I think I'll get in the bathtub, and then curl up with a good book. 
"
2,3,Anchor,"And so today South Park held a parade to honor Officer Barbrady and his heroic work on the Chickenfucker case. 
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
"
2,3,Man 1,"Speech! Speech!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"What?
"
2,3,Stan,"They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious. 
"
2,3,Man 2,"Oh, yeah!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered!  And finally, I'd like to say that  reading totally sucks ass!
"
2,3,Stan/Kyle,"Hooray!
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!
"
2,3,"Stan, Kyle","Hooray for Barbrady! 
"
2,3,Kyle,"Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.
"
2,3,Stan,"I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
"
2,3,Kyle,"It's poetic justice.
"
2,3,Barbrady,"Thanks, boys.
"
2,3,Kenny,"(Ow!)
"
2,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey. 
"
2,4,Stan,"Booooo!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Nuh-now, who was that?  That is not appropriate behavior, m'kay?
"
2,4,Stan,"I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again.
"
2,4,Kyle,"We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay? 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, okay, okay, that's fine.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Okay?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Okay.  Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad.  You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad.  You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Okay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?  Yes, Stan?
"
2,4,Stan,"Why do dogs have cold noses?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uhhh, well, I'm not sure.
"
2,4,Stan,"Oh.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana.  Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,  so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,  and when it gets back up to me,  we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you…
"
2,4,Kyle,"Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
"
2,4,Stan,"Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
"
2,4,Kyle,"No, it's his bris.
"
2,4,Cartman,"What the hell is a ""bris""?
"
2,4,Kyle,"I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"…and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?  No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.  Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney…
"
2,4,Stan,"Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
"
2,4,Kyle,"Uhhh... I'm not sure.
"
2,4,Stan,"Well, dude, you better find out!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Boys, are you paying attention?
"
2,4,Stan,"Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet?  Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now?  Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay?  Uh-oh.
"
2,4,Principal Victoria,"I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid? 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria.
"
2,4,Principal Victoria,"We-hell, ""sorry"" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"You mean I'm fired?
"
2,4,Principal Victoria,"Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--
"
2,4,Principal Victoria,"It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"But--
"
2,4,Principal Victoria,"We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m-m'kay? Wha-what will I do for money??
"
2,4,Principal Victoria,"There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"No-uho-uho-uho!  Not o-uho-uhokay!
"
2,4,Stan,"Man! That sucked, getting searched. 
"
2,4,Cartman,"Yeah, my ass is killing me.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
"
2,4,Cartman,"I wonder who took it.
"
2,4,Announcer,"And now it's almost time for BoBo's. 
"
2,4,Chef,"Hello there, children.
"
2,4,Boys,"Hey, Chef.
"
2,4,Kyle,"How's it going?
"
2,4,Chef,"Bad.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Why bad?
"
2,4,Chef,"Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?
"
2,4,Stan,"No, dude, we never even saw it!
"
2,4,Chef,"Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!
"
2,4,Stan,"We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
"
2,4,Chef,"Right. But do you know why they're bad?
"
2,4,Kyle,"Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
"
2,4,Chef,"And do you have any idea what that means?
"
2,4,Kyle,"No.
"
2,4,Cartman,"I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.
"
2,4,Chef,"Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?
"
2,4,Boys,"Dude!
"
2,4,Chef,"Okay. 
"
2,4,Kyle,"Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
"
2,4,Chef,"Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!
"
2,4,Stan,"What do ya mean?
"
2,4,Chef,"Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Wo-what's that?
"
2,4,Chef,"Oh boy. Here we go again.  Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
"
2,4,Stan,"Ahhh, bicycles?
"
2,4,Cartman,"Ham?
"
2,4,Kyle,"No, not ham, you fat fuck!
"
2,4,Cartman,"Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?
"
2,4,Chef,"No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Your heart?
"
2,4,Stan,"Your eyes? 
"
2,4,Kenny,"(Ooh, the penis!)
"
2,4,Chef,"That's right.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.
"
2,4,Chef,"A ""fireman""?
"
2,4,Cartman,"That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking.
"
2,4,Chef,"Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?  Ask your parents for once!
"
2,4,Kyle,"Hey, wait! 
"
2,4,Stan,"Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
"
2,4,Female passenger,"Hey, Mackey, you got any more pot? My four-year-old needs a fix! Yehahahahaha! 
"
2,4,Driver 1,"Hey, Mackey! Now we see what you and Homer Simpson have in common, d'oh-pe!  Ha ha ha ha! 
"
2,4,Driver 2,"Heeey, Mackey!
"
2,4,Driver 3,"Hey, Mackey! Why did the drug user cross the road?
"
2,4,Driver 3's Passenger,"Who do you think you are, you stupid drug-taking hippie?! You damn hippies are all alike!
"
2,4,Driver 4,"Won't you leave the guy alone? 
"
2,4,Driver 5,"Hey, hippie, are you gonna do some drugs?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uuuuuugh! 
"
2,4,Bartender,"Hey, I don't think I've seen you around here before.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job.
"
2,4,Bartender,"Oh that's weak, man. You know what you need? You need a good, stiff drink. 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay?
"
2,4,Bartender,"Trust me, man! It'll make you feel better. 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Ughuh...  Drinkin's bad.
"
2,4,Devil,"Go ahead. Drink the beer. It'll calm you down.
"
2,4,Angel,"Yeah, why the hell not? It's just a beer. Don't be such a pussy, m'kay? 
"
2,4,Bartender,"So how do you feel?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Woah, about the same.
"
2,4,Bartender,"Oh, you just need something a little stronger. 
"
2,4,Stan,"Kyle! You have to stop them!
"
2,4,Kyle,"Stop who?
"
2,4,Stan,"Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
"
2,4,Kyle,"What?
"
2,4,Stan,"They're gonna chop off his wee wee! 
"
2,4,Kyle,"Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
"
2,4,Stan,"Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
"
2,4,Cartman,"Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!
"
2,4,Kyle,"That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
"
2,4,Stan,"Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!
"
2,4,Kyle,"I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 
"
2,4,Mr Mackey,"We are young, m'kay?Heartache to heartache we stand, m'kay?No promises, no demands, m-m'kay..?  Whoa... Is this my house?
"
2,4,Landlord,"Your key ain't gonna work, Mackey! I changed the locks!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Why, Mr. Freely?
"
2,4,Mr. Freely,"I'm not rentin' to you anymore! I heard that you got fired from your job for selling drugs to children!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"No, no, no, m'kay? I-it wasn't like that.
"
2,4,Mr. Freely,"Drugs are an illegal narcotic! And having never taken drugs, I can say that they have nothing to offer!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"But I've never taken drugs either.
"
2,4,Mr. Freely,"I've never taken drugs, and look at me! I'm totally fine! Now get off my property before I lose control and kill you! 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Huuhh?  Ow, m'kay?!
"
2,4,Mr. Freely,"Drug user! Druuug user!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, uh-- 
"
2,4,Mr. Freely,"Come back here, dammit!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Whoa, wait! 
"
2,4,Sheila,"Just a little higher. 
"
2,4,Kyle,"Mom! Dad!
"
2,4,Sheila,"Oh, hi, bubele. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party.
"
2,4,Gerald,"Your mother's made gahekgafuga.
"
2,4,Cartman,"What the hell is gahekgafuga?
"
2,4,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
"
2,4,Sheila,"To celebrate your little brother's  passage into life.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Meaning what?
"
2,4,Gerald,"Meaning we're going to circumcise him. 
"
2,4,Cartman,"They are gonna cut off his fireman!
"
2,4,Sheila,"It's Jewish tradition, bubbe.
"
2,4,Gerald,"Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--
"
2,4,Kyle,"AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! 
"
2,4,Gerald,"Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him? 
"
2,4,"Sheila, Gerald","Let us cut off you pee pee, Stan!
"
2,4,"Stan, Cartman","AAAAGGGGHHHH!!!! Aaagg-that's the sickest friggin' thing-run, ruuun!
"
2,4,Kenny,"(Run, dude!) 
"
2,4,Sheila,"Oy, what is the matter with them?
"
2,4,Kyle,"I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
"
2,4,Stan,"What are you goin' to do, dude?
"
2,4,Kyle,"I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
"
2,4,Cartman,"No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!
"
2,4,Kyle,"Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?
"
2,4,Hobo,"Hey, you want somethin' to warm you up?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken.
"
2,4,Hobo,"Here, try this; it'll warm you up.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Marijuwana's bad.
"
2,4,Hobo,"What?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Ma-marijuwana makes you feel depressed and low, m'kay?
"
2,4,Hobo,"And you don't fell that way now?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, good point.  No, I don't feel any d-oooohh...  Oh, baby, get down, m'kay?
"
2,4,Hobo,"Uh-huh. 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Man, this alley is cool! It's so alive and beautiful! 
"
2,4,Hobo,"Ohh, boy.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?
"
2,4,Clerk,"Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes.
"
2,4,Kyle,"You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?
"
2,4,Ike,"No!
"
2,4,Kyle,"I need one ticket for my little brother.
"
2,4,Clerk,"That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
"
2,4,Kyle,"Huh?
"
2,4,Clerk,"I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train.
"
2,4,Kyle,"But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
"
2,4,Clerk,"What?! Why the hell would they do that?
"
2,4,Kyle,"They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
"
2,4,Clerk,"No can do, sonny.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
"
2,4,Ike,"Don't kick the-- 
"
2,4,Kyle,"Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
"
2,4,Ike,"Bye-bye.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, man, where am I?
"
2,4,Teen 1,"Hey, wow, it's that counselor from elementary school, Mr. Mackey.
"
2,4,Teen 2,"Wow, dude.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, hi, boys, how are you today?
"
2,4,Teen 1,"Pretty good, man. How are you?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs.
"
2,4,Teen 1,"Hey! Us, too!
"
2,4,Teen 2,"Yeah, remember? You caught us smoking weed in the bathroom and got us suspended.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh. O Fortune, how you mock me?
"
2,4,Teen 1,"Oh, cheer up, bro; all you need is some clear liquid to get your head straight.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm...  Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth?  Yeah, baby... The world is so small.  I'm free... I'm free...
"
2,4,Teen 2,"Sweet dude, totally killer.
"
2,4,Teen 1,"That guy's totally trippin'. 
"
2,4,Kyle,"There, what do you think?
"
2,4,Cartman,"What the hell is that supposed to be?
"
2,4,Kyle,"I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
"
2,4,Stan,"Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!
"
2,4,Stan,"Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
"
2,4,Kyle,"I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Is that why it stinks so bad? 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Hi, boys.
"
2,4,Boys,"Hi, Mr. Mackey.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Are you boys stayin' out of trouble?
"
2,4,Boys,"Yes.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while. 
"
2,4,Kyle,"Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
"
2,4,Cartman,"No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
"
2,4,Stan,"Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
"
2,4,Cartman,"Eech.  Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!
"
2,4,Ike,"Oh.  Oooh. 
"
2,4,Woman,"Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can. 
"
2,4,Ike,"Yeah. No more walbolching! 
"
2,4,Sheila,"Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 
"
2,4,Sheila,"How is my little jellybean?
"
2,4,Kyle,"Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 
"
2,4,Sheila,"Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss. 
"
2,4,Kyle,"No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 
"
2,4,Sheila,"Aaaaargh! Omigod, make him stop!
"
2,4,Gerald,"AAAGGGHH!!!
"
2,4,Kyle,"Put him down, you stupid dog!
"
2,4,Sheila,"My baby! Oh, God, the horror! 
"
2,4,Gerald,"Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go! 
"
2,4,Sheila,"Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine!  Waagghh!!  My baby!!
"
2,4,Driver,"Huuh? 
"
2,4,"Gerald, Sheila","Aaaggghhh! Aaagh aaagghh! 
"
2,4,Sheila,"Oh, he's dead, he's dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!
"
2,4,Gerald,"There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do. 
"
2,4,Priest,"""Yea, usher us unto the Lord"", sayeth some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 
"
2,4,Kyle,"Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
"
2,4,Sheila,"Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted.
"
2,4,Kyle,"What??
"
2,4,Gerald,"He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. 
"
2,4,Kyle,"You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
"
2,4,Sheila,"What are you talking about?
"
2,4,Kyle,"Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! 
"
2,4,Sheila,"What-what-whaaat?!
"
2,4,Stan,"Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
"
2,4,Cartman,"Fireman!
"
2,4,Kyle,"Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
"
2,4,Kenny,"(Hey!)  (Hey, you guys! I'm dy--) 
"
2,4,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2,4,Kyle,"You bastards! 
"
2,4,Priest,"""Yea, let us ponder the Lord's mercy. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."" 
"
2,4,Jimbo,"Get outta the way, you damn hippie!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I don't need to take you right-wing authoritative bullshit!
"
2,4,Jimbo,"What?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay?
"
2,4,Jimbo,"Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert? 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I can't, man. Jerry Bear's dead, m'kay?
"
2,4,Blonde,"He-e-ey, man, I overheard what you said; that was coool!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"What? Oh, thanks, man.
"
2,4,Blonde,"Would you like to come over to my place and finger-paint?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Sure, man. Finger-paintin's cool, m'kay? 
"
2,4,Sheila,"Now, where did you leave him, young man?
"
2,4,Kyle,"Aw, how the hell should I know?
"
2,4,Sheila,"Gerald! Do something about your smart-ass son!
"
2,4,Gerald,"Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass.
"
2,4,Sheila,"If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!  Ike, love?
"
2,4,Kyle,"All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
"
2,4,Gerald,"Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Yeah, right.
"
2,4,Sheila,"Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.
"
2,4,Clerk,"Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar.
"
2,4,Sheila,"Come on!
"
2,4,Sheila,"Ike!
"
2,4,Ike,"Mamatoedoe.
"
2,4,Barkeep,"Hey, lady, that's my table post! You can't have that!
"
2,4,Mackey,"Wow, man. You know, it's like… You go through life thinking that you're an individual, m'kay? And then you realize that you're more than that, m'kay. We're all just one big individual, m'kay?
"
2,4,Blonde,"Let's get married and have a honeymoon in India.
"
2,4,Mackey,"M'kay. 
"
2,4,Gerald,"Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!
"
2,4,Sheila,"But first, apologize to your brother!
"
2,4,Kyle,"He's not my brother!
"
2,4,Gerald,"Apologize to him!
"
2,4,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Ike. 
"
2,4,Ike,"Uh oh, stufid. 
"
2,4,Blonde,"Wooow, this is sooo beautiful!
"
2,4,Mackey,"I am one with the animals. And the trees.
"
2,4,Blonde,"And I am one with you. 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"At long last I have foundA true reason to beNow I feel I can start anew--  Woo, whoa! Ow! Hey!  Uh oh hel-m. Hey!
"
2,4,Blonde,"Whoa...
"
2,4,Mackey,"Yeah I got, m'kay?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh-- What the hell is going on?!
"
2,4,Jimbo,"Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks!
"
2,4,Principal Victoria,"We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help.
"
2,4,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I don't want help!
"
2,4,Principal Victoria,"You'll thank us later. 
"
2,4,Sheila,"Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris.
"
2,4,Ike,"Uh oh.
"
2,4,Sheila,"Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray!
"
2,4,Uncle Murray,"Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle?
"
2,4,Sheila,"He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted. 
"
2,4,Guest,"Hi there!
"
2,4,Sheila,"Hello. Do I know you?
"
2,4,Guest,"Uh-no, but I never miss a bris. Here, I brought some dip. 
"
2,4,Sheila,"Ohhh, thanks.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.
"
2,4,Ike,"Oh deh family nrr.
"
2,4,Kyle,"What do you want?!
"
2,4,Ike,"I wumuh trecompr. Com. Tebruhnerr. 
"
2,4,Kyle,"Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
"
2,4,Stan,"Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
"
2,4,Kyle,"No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
"
2,4,Ike,"Cookie Monster,  two, three, four, five. 
"
2,4,Kyle,"Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
"
2,4,Ike,"Baraterndr nfard fy. 
"
2,4,Social Worker,"You have to admit you have a problem before anyone can help you.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"But I don't think I really have a problem.
"
2,4,Social Worker,"Nonsense! You did drugs! I suppose you forgot all about your family.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I don't really have a family.
"
2,4,Social Worker,"And you lost your job.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"No, I lost my job before that.
"
2,4,Social Worker,"Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an adult.  The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them. There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's called college! Now, I want you to repeat after me: Drugs are bad.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Drugs are baad.
"
2,4,Social Worker,"Drugs are bad.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uhh... Dru-drugs are baad.
"
2,4,Sheila,"Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris.
"
2,4,Dr. Schwartz,"Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought the normal cutting device, but then I remembered that Ike was Canadian, so I brought the right one.  Where is the little rug rat?
"
2,4,Sheila,"Right over here. 
"
2,4,Dr. Schwartz,"Come 'ere, you.
"
2,4,Ike,"Oowwww!  Oh deh faminrr. 
"
2,4,Dr. Schwartz,"Ike? Ike?
"
2,4,Ike,"Heh cohcoh mondefern menurr. 
"
2,4,Dr. Schwartz,"There you are. Come on Ike, it's time.
"
2,4,Kyle,"You stay away from my little brother!
"
2,4,Dr. Schwartz,"Bu-bu-but, son, I just--
"
2,4,Kyle,"You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
"
2,4,Sheila,"Kyle, what are you talking about?
"
2,4,Kyle,"And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
"
2,4,Cartman,"Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye. 
"
2,4,Dr. Schwartz,"Kyle... a-a circumcision is a very common thing for Ike to have. His father had it, his grandfather had it, and...  his brother had it.
"
2,4,Kyle,"No!  No, it isn't true!
"
2,4,Dr. Schwartz,"We're not going to cut it off! We're just goin' to snip it, so it looks bigger.
"
2,4,Stan,"Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
"
2,4,Cartman,"Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too. 
"
2,4,Social Worker,"Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are fully recovered.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again.
"
2,4,Social Worker,"Just one more thing.  Remember that you can stay sober.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will.  M'kay?
"
2,4,Kyle,"It's okay, Ike. I'm here.
"
2,4,Dr. Schwartz,"And-a one and-a two and-a… bris. 
"
2,4,Ike,"Ouch. Amuhbuhbuhbuh.  Cookie Monster.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Ike, you're okay. 
"
2,4,Stan,"Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
"
2,4,Stan,"Yeah.
"
2,4,Kyle,"And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.
"
2,4,Stan,"Naturally.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!
"
2,4,Mr. Garrison,"And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol. 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life... 
"
2,4,Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?
"
2,4,Stan,"You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
"
2,4,Cartman,"No way, I set up mine first, hippie!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your life someday, m'kay?
"
2,4,Stan,"Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay.
"
2,4,Kyle,"M'kay?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Okay?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Okay.  Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?
"
2,5,Chef,"Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball! 
"
2,5,Kyle,"We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
"
2,5,Stan,"Yeah.
"
2,5,Chef,"So let's have half the children on this side  and half the children on that side. 
"
2,5,Pip,"Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball.
"
2,5,Cartman,"What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?
"
2,5,Pip,"Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--
"
2,5,Stan,"Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
"
2,5,Pip,"Oh, dear.
"
2,5,Stan,"If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
"
2,5,Pip,"Oh, what jolly good fun!
"
2,5,Kyle,"No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
"
2,5,Chef,"Play ball! 
"
2,5,Clyde,"Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!
"
2,5,Stan,"Dammit, we lost one already!
"
2,5,Chef,"Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh.
"
2,5,Stan,"Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup! 
"
2,5,Jordan,"Aagghhh!
"
2,5,Stan,"We're losing men fast out here! 
"
2,5,Chef,"Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall! 
"
2,5,Kyle,"I caught it! I caught it!
"
2,5,Chef,"Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!
"
2,5,Kyle,"Here, Pip, you throw. 
"
2,5,Pip,"Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
"
2,5,Pip,"I'm not French--
"
2,5,Kyle,"Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow! 
"
2,5,Chef,"Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!
"
2,5,Cartman,"Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.
"
2,5,Pip,"Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!
"
2,5,Chef,"That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office. 
"
2,5,Kyle,"No. No, it'll be okay!
"
2,5,Chef,"Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on. 
"
2,5,Kyle,"Oh-- Noooo!
"
2,5,Cartman,"Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.
"
2,5,Clyde,"I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
"
2,5,Bebe,"I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
"
2,5,Cartman,"Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?
"
2,5,Stan,"No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Are you Kyle Broflovski? 
"
2,5,Kyle,"Ye-yes.
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?
"
2,5,Kyle,"Ye-yes.
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you.
"
2,5,Kyle,"I know.
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"So open them. 
"
2,5,Kyle,"Oh!  Phew.
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Now, what seems to be the problem?
"
2,5,Kyle,"Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack. 
"
2,5,Kyle,"AAGGGGGHHHH!!
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"What?
"
2,5,Kyle,"OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head.
"
2,5,Kyle,"AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
"
2,5,Kyle,"...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
"
2,5,Boys,"Eewwww!
"
2,5,Cartman,"Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?
"
2,5,Kyle,"No. No-it looked dead.
"
2,5,Boys,"Eewwww!
"
2,5,Stan,"Wa-was it wearing clothes?
"
2,5,Kyle,"Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
"
2,5,Stan,"Oh, yeah. Eeww.
"
2,5,Boys,"Eewwww!
"
2,5,Kyle,"And then she walked over to--
"
2,5,Sheila,"Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called ""conjoined twin myslexia"".
"
2,5,Cartman,"Who the hell cares what it's called, as long as she doesn't have to touch me.
"
2,5,Sheila,"Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys.  You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins. 
"
2,5,The Boys,"Gross!
"
2,5,Sheila,"But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached.  Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it! 
"
2,5,Stan,"AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"
2,5,Cartman,"AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
"
2,5,Sheila,"So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?
"
2,5,Kyle,"Uhhhh... Yeah. 
"
2,5,Sheila,"Can you imagine that poor, poor woman?
"
2,5,Gerald,"Mm-hmm.
"
2,5,Sheila,"Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day...
"
2,5,Gerald,"Mm-hmm. 
"
2,5,Sheila,"Hello?
"
2,5,Sharon,"Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother. 
"
2,5,Sheila,"Oh, yes. Hello, Sharon.
"
2,5,Sharon,"Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?
"
2,5,Stan,"No! I have to get it out!
"
2,5,Sheila,"Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.
"
2,5,Sharon,"So this is your fault.
"
2,5,Stan,"ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"
2,5,Randy,"Damn it, stop.  Oh!  Damm it!
"
2,5,Sharon,"Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead? 
"
2,5,Sheila,"That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!
"
2,5,Gerald,"Mm-hmm.
"
2,5,Stan,"Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
"
2,5,Cartman,"Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
"
2,5,Chef,"Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!
"
2,5,All,"Awww...
"
2,5,Stan,"Aw, do we have to?
"
2,5,Kyle,"Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
"
2,5,Chef,"You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!
"
2,5,Cartman,"Heyh! They have a zoo there!
"
2,5,Chef,"That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do! 
"
2,5,Stan,"Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
"
2,5,Kyle,"Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
"
2,5,Pip,"I'd love to!
"
2,5,Cartman,"Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.
"
2,5,Pip,"Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.  And besides, I hate French people. 
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?
"
2,5,Sheila,"Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"O-of course you do.
"
2,5,Sheila,"I want to talk to you all about your school nurse. 
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--
"
2,5,Sheila,"No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of.
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"Oh, and uh, what disease is that?
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia.
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"What's that?
"
2,5,Sheila,"She has a dead fetus attached to her head.
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"She does?
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Y-you never noticed that?
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"No-o, I never did.
"
2,5,Sheila,"Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?
"
2,5,Sheila,"I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Do we have to eat kosher stuff?
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8?
"
2,5,Sheila,"Wonderful!
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?
"
2,5,Chef,"Okay children.  Now, who's gonna win the State Finals? 
"
2,5,Clyde,"Denver?
"
2,5,Chef,"Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
I think we need to get off on this exit.
"
2,5,Mrs. Crabtree,"SIT DOWN, KID!!
"
2,5,Chef,"But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!
"
2,5,Ms. Crabtree,"DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL?!
"
2,5,Chef,"How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!
"
2,5,Ms. Crabtree,"I SAID SIT DOOWWN!!!
"
2,5,Chef,"Yes, ma'am.
"
2,5,Stan,"Whoa, dude, this is a school? 
"
2,5,Bob Thomas,"Hello, there. I'm Bob Thomas, the coach for the Denver Cougars. 
"
2,5,Chef,"I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows.
"
2,5,Bob Thomas,"Well, I certainly want to thank you for bringing your team down. Apparently, nobody else would play us, because they knew we'd just beat 'em silly. So I told the school board to find me some hick school from the mountains, and here you are.  You're from South Park, yeah?
"
2,5,Chef,"Yeah.
"
2,5,Bob Thomas,"My G-hod, amazing where people can live nowadays. Well, we might as well get this over with; we've gotta start thinking about D.C. Promise we won't make it too painful. 
"
2,5,Referee,"Play ball!
"
2,5,Sheila,"So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Colorado State.
"
2,5,Sheila,"Ahhh.
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"Oh. 
"
2,5,Gerald,"Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?  I mean, gravy.  Ow!
"
2,5,Black boy,"Ow! 
"
2,5,Chef,"Dammit, come on!  Somebody catch the ball! 
"
2,5,Bob Thomas,"All right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go! 
"
2,5,Cartman,"I caught it, I caught it!
"
2,5,Player 1,"Oh, that's not fair! He's so fat, it stuck in his belly!
"
2,5,Referee 2,"South Park on offense!
"
2,5,Chef,"Great job, children! Just stay focused now.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Go for it, Pip. 
"
2,5,Pip,"Oh, bother.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Come on, you Frenchy little frog!
"
2,5,Pip,"Gagghh! 
"
2,5,Chef,"Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip!
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"Ehsooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight.
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?
"
2,5,Gerald,"Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!
"
2,5,Sheila,"Gerald!  Keep your damn mouth shut!
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"I-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really.
"
2,5,Sheila,"Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum.
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"No, I'm quite secure with it.
"
2,5,Sheila,"I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand.
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Could I get some more pork?
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death.
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"No, really, I don't need a--
"
2,5,Sheila,"Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop.
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person.
"
2,5,Sheila,"I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring.
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"But I really don't think--
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?
"
2,5,Sheila,"Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now! 
"
2,5,Chef,"You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions.
"
2,5,Cartman,"Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumbass European hippie piece of crap. 
"
2,5,Kyle,"Get him, Frenchy!
"
2,5,Pip,"Gaagghh! 
"
2,5,Referee 2,"South Park wins! 
"
2,5,Chef,"We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!
"
2,5,Player 6,"Uh-hu-hu-hu-howieee!  Ihit hurhurts! Howieee!  Mommy, it huurts! Ihit hurhurts! 
"
2,5,Chef,"Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!
Ooo, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red
"
2,5,Mayor,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals;  where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.  But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!  And now, let's kick off our weeklong festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!  Let's hear it for these brave souls!  What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators! 
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job.
"
2,5,Mayor,"Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.
"
2,5,Chef,"How much further is Washington, D.C.?
"
2,5,Mrs. Crabtree,"SIT DOWN, KID!!
"
2,5,Chef,"I need to know how far it is, lady!
"
2,5,Mrs. Crabtree,"I SAID SIT DOWN!!!
"
2,5,Chef,"Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat hog.
"
2,5,Mrs. Crabtree,"WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
"
2,5,Chef,"I said, ""I've always wanted to visit Prague.""
"
2,5,Mrs. Crabtree,"Oh, me too. 
"
2,5,Stan,"Okay, what have you got?
"
2,5,Kyle,"Some hadka fish, some gafagga...
"
2,5,Cartman,"I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll! 
"
2,5,Stan,"Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!  Places! 
"
2,5,Ms. Crabtree,"ARRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!! 
"
2,5,Kids,"Whoa!
"
2,5,Kenny,"(Sheesh!)
"
2,5,Chef,"Damn, man. This is the big time, alright.
"
2,5,Stan,"Chef, we're hungry.
"
2,5,Chef,"You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese.
"
2,5,Cartman,"My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
"
2,5,Chef,"What?
"
2,5,Referee,"Are you Chef?
"
2,5,Chef,"Yeah.
"
2,5,Referee,"The Washington team has forfeited the game. Congratulations, you're national champions.
"
2,5,Chef,"What? We did it! Children, we won!
"
2,5,Kyle,"Wow, that was easy.
"
2,5,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear a round of applause for the new national champions of dodgeball, the South Park Cows! 
"
2,5,Kyle,"Hey, why did you guys forfeit?
"
2,5,Player,"You mean you don't know?
"
2,5,Kyle,"Know what?
"
2,5,Player,"Last year's national champions were the Austin Pirates. They played China for the world championship. Only four of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball players aren't like us. 
"
2,5,Master,"Bush langli. Woon taun. Waya ching gia!
"
2,5,Player,"They do nothing but dodgeball, day in, and day out. They use steroids and advanced training equipment to make them, not kids, but animals.  Well, good luck. We've got our futures to think about. 
"
2,5,Chef,"Okay, children, back in the bus.
"
2,5,The Mayor,"And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison. 
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh, no..! 
"
2,5,Singer,"You've got the strength, you've got the courage
Even with a dead fetus on your head
You carry on
You fight for tomorrow
Dead fetus or no, you never let go
You're my conjoined-twin-dead-thing-hanging-off-your-head woman
"
2,5,The Scenes,"She's painting her house orange, and annoyed that Garrison is filming it.
She looks out the window, and is annoyed that he is still there, filming.
She's in her office.
She's at the supermarket, annoyed, she's trying to cover the camera lens so Garrison would stop filming.
At the post office, she's trying to shoo him away, she's very angry that he's filming her.
She's on the toilet, and she clamps her legs shut, with hands before them for added security. She's outraged.
"
2,5,Barbrady,"Oh, that was so touching.
"
2,5,The Mayor,"And now, friends, it's time to present the Lifetime Conjoined Twin Achievement Award. This award goes to outstanding conjoined twins who have made a mark on society. And the winner is... 
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Nurse Gollum.
"
2,5,The Mayor,"Nurse Gollum!! 
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh, boy.
"
2,5,Jimbo,"Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in.  Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China. 
"
2,5,Chef,"Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game.
"
2,5,Stan,"But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
"
2,5,Chef,"Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions.
"
2,5,Kyle,"But we could get killed!
"
2,5,Chef,"And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?  Just imagine: a big yellow ""Dodgeball Champions"" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!
"
2,5,Stan,"Dude, Chef has lost it.
"
2,5,Chef,"You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!
"
2,5,Cartman,"So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh? 
"
2,5,Kyle,"Dude, what does that mean?
"
2,5,Cartman,"I dunno.
"
2,5,Stan,"Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? 
"
2,5,Kyle,"Yeah, you're from China.
"
2,5,Kevin,"No, I'm from America. My parents are Chinese.
"
2,5,Stan,"Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
"
2,5,Kevin,"I have no idea, dude.
"
2,5,Cartman,"Come on, rice picker!
"
2,5,Chef,"Hey, hey hey!  Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity.
"
2,5,Stan,"You don't?
"
2,5,Kyle,"But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
"
2,5,Chef,"No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country.
"
2,5,"Stan, Kyle","Ohhh.
"
2,5,Cartman,"Oooh, I get it.
"
2,5,Kevin,"Yeah.
"
2,5,Mrs. Crabtree,"AAAGGGGHHHH!
"
2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Hiit ita wita great pride, that huwe huwelcome ourn American friend. Now let the  champion of dodgeball be deshide! 
"
2,5,Stan,"Damn, dude. China's fucked up.
"
2,5,Referee,"Take places!
"
2,5,Chef,"All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!
"
2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Okay, Tom, rooks rike A-mericans are getting ready to play. I don't suppose they'll have any problems seeing the ball with their big American eyes! 
"
2,5,Tom,"Yeah. Good thing they have those big eyes so that they don't have to rery on that amazing American interrect. 
"
2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Oh, you say such things.
"
2,5,Tom,"That's a zinger!
"
2,5,Referee,"Praaayyy braal! 
"
2,5,Chef,"Holy crap..!  God damn...
"
2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Hey, hey, what do you call white American person with PhD in a physics and-a math?
"
2,5,Tom,"Ah, I don't know. What?
"
2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Stupid American! 
"
2,5,Tom,"Aw, no way!! 
"
2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Oooh, another American is down! It's numbuh-- uuhhh... Oh, I don't know. All American look alike! 
"
2,5,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
2,5,Kyle,"You... bastards...
"
2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Oooh, my, I haven't seen an American die like that since Abraham Lincoln! 
"
2,5,Tom,"Dude, that is-a not cool! You're gonna get us into trouble again.
"
2,5,Mayor,"Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China.  Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats! 
"
2,5,Chinese Commentator,"And there is-a only a one South Park prayer left.  Still all Chinese prayer. This should be over veerry shortly.
"
2,5,Chinese kid,"Come on! Throw ball!
"
2,5,Tom,"Hey, you wanna hear my impersonation of American?
"
2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Yeah, yeah!
"
2,5,Tom,"Ah, okay.  Hey, I really, really want that. That looks good. 
"
2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Hey, hey. Let me try, let me try.  I'll use my credit card.  Eh-eh-uh... Do you have any non-dairy creamer? 
"
2,5,Tom,"Yes yes!  Y'all come a-back now, you hear? 
"
2,5,Chef,"Oh, what have I done?  You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good.  If we had won the world championship, what then?  It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.  Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?  Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home.
"
2,5,Chinese kid,"Come on! Throw ball!
"
2,5,Kevin,"Hey, if you wanna make him throw the ball, say this. 
"
2,5,Player 70,"Thanks, you American dumb-ass!  ""You French piece of crap! Throw ball!  What's the matter, Frenchy? You got crepes in your ears."" 
"
2,5,Pip,"Arrggghhh! 
"
2,5,Chinese Commentator,"And the winner is South Park Cows! 
"
2,5,Pip,"Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day! 
"
2,5,Chef,"Shut up, Pip.
"
2,5,Stan,"Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?
"
2,5,Pip,"Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--
"
2,5,"Kids, Chef","Shut up, Pip!
"
2,5,The Mayor,"As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation.  Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows! 
"
2,5,Kyle,"What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
"
2,5,Mayor,"And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!
"
2,5,Kyle,"Agghh!
"
2,5,Stan,"Dude, it's the freak nurse!
"
2,5,Cartman,"Holy crap!
"
2,5,Sheila,"Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!
"
2,5,Kyle,"Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week.
"
2,5,Sheila,"She's really touched.
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"What I really wanna say is... well, -egh-- This may sound odd coming from a woman with a fetus sticking out of her head, but... you're all a bunch of freaks! 
"
2,5,Mayor,"Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now--
"
2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out?  I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long.  Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other.  And take those stupid things off your heads! 
"
2,5,Principal Victoria,"Oh, my, what an ungrateful bitch.
"
2,5,Sheila,"Yeah, the nerve of some people.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
"
2,5,Stan,"Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
"
2,5,Cartman,"I love you guys.  Ah, screw you guys(!)
"
2,6,Announcer,"And now back to Huntin' and Killin with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned! 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.
"
2,6,Ned,"M-hi, Ned.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?  We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call ""Pussy Law #4"", states that we can no longer kill animals in defense.
(""PUSSY LAW #4""
NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED,
EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS
SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS
IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY
BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE
PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE
BODILY HARM.)
In other words, our old line of, ""It's comin' right for us""--
"
2,6,Ned,"It's comin' right for us.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"--no longer works. So now, we only kill naimals to, quote, ""thin out their numbers"". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die.  Uhh... So roll the tape.  Here we are at Shafer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!  Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!
"
2,6,Ned,"Thin out their numbers! 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Good work, Ned. Now they won't starve.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.
"
2,6,Ned,"Mmm-we're environmentalists.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"""What's Vietnam?"" A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war.
"
2,6,Mr. Hat,"That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky.
"
2,6,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?
"
2,6,Injured Man,"Aaawwwgh... Aaawwwgh...
"
2,6,Leader,"Come on, men! Let's go! Jump out of the chopper!
"
2,6,Man 1,"Who's next to take a shower?
"
2,6,Man 2,"Me-ee!
"
2,6,Man 3,"I am.
"
2,6,Man 1,"You just took one last week, silly.
"
2,6,Man 2,"Oh, where can I hide this big pipe?
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but sometimes, I like to pretend I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper.
"
2,6,Class,"Awww..!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Son of a bitch.
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it.
"
2,6,Clyde,"What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit.
"
2,6,Clyde,"Oh.
"
2,6,Stan,"Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.
"
2,6,Kyle,"Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained.  One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist.  Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog.  There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!  Now, freeze it!  Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?
"
2,6,Ned,"M-whoa, I'm scared.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then...
We're so glad you spent your time with us
While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts
Come again and stay a while
We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed
"
2,6,Ned,"Mm-good night.
"
2,6,Cameraman,"A-and we're cut. Great show, guys.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley.  So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?
"
2,6,Stan,"No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Oh. Yeah, we sure were.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Was it fun?
"
2,6,Kyle,"Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun.
"
2,6,Stan,"Whoa!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Yepper, that's where me and Ned met.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Oh, boy, what a gorgeous day! 
"
2,6,Sergeant,"Kern, get over here! The new privates are here. I'm assigning one of them to you as a trainee. Ned Gerblansky. 
"
2,6,Ned,"Ned Gerblansky reporting, sir.
"
2,6,Sergeant,"Thanks, Ned. Now, the bad guys have been spotted about ten klicks north of here. I know that you and Kern are best suited to take them out. Are you up for it?
"
2,6,"Jimbo, Ned","Sir, yes, sir! 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?
"
2,6,Ned,"Certainly. And would you like another muffin as well?
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Why the hell not? We're at war.  Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat.
"
2,6,Ned,"No, that's all lies. I'll be fine. Charlies at 2 o'clock!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"I see 'em! Drop the bomb!
"
2,6,Ned,"The bomb's not releasing!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Oh, no!
"
2,6,Ned,"It won't budge.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Then we only have one option. 
"
2,6,Ned,"What are you doing, man?!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards! 
"
2,6,Ned,"Yaaarrrggghhh!!!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Aaarrrggghh-- Oh no! Out of ammo!  We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Vietcong Army!
"
2,6,Ned,"Whoopie. 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes! 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"And that's the way it happened, boys.
"
2,6,Stan,"Wow!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Man, Vietnam was sweet!
"
2,6,Cameraman,"Great news, guys. Your TV show ratings have doubled!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Wow!
"
2,6,Cameraman,"They've gone from six people to twelve.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Holy smokes! We could get an Emmy!
"
2,6,Producer,"We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show.
"
2,6,Jesus,"But I don't really care about that.
"
2,6,Producer,"Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times.
"
2,6,Jesus,"Ohh, alright.
"
2,6,Cameraman,"Alright, we're ten second to air, guys.
"
2,6,Producer,"Remember, big, big, big! 
"
2,6,Cameraman,"And five, four, three... 
"
2,6,Announcer,"It's your hour of power on midday Mountain Cable Access. Put your hands together and welcome the only man in town who always has a fully-stocked wine cellar, Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-sus Christ! 
"
2,6,Jesus,"Uhhh... Hi.  Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction.  We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver.
"
2,6,Announcer,"Here's  Booooobbb Denver. 
"
2,6,Jesus,"Hi, Bob Denver.
"
2,6,Bob,"Hi, Jesus. Great to be here. 
"
2,6,Jesus,"So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?
"
2,6,Bob,"Yup. Just got in.
"
2,6,Jesus,"So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?
"
2,6,Bob,"Nn-nothing. Nothing really at all. 
"
2,6,Disciples vocalist,"Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'  
You gotta have something
"
2,6,Jesus,"Oh boy.
"
2,6,Stan,"""...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam."" The end.
"
2,6,Boys,"The end.
"
2,6,Kyle,"Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison?
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"Yes.  Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit? 
"
2,6,Stan,"From Vietnam veterans.
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie.
"
2,6,Stan,"No, no, we didn't--
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"You all receive an F... minus.
"
2,6,Kyle,"F-minus? Can he do that?
"
2,6,Stan,"Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"Stanley, the Vietnam War was war! There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides.
"
2,6,Kyle,"How do you know? You weren't even there.
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"Well, that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week!
"
2,6,Boys,"Aawwww!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
2,6,Mr. Mackey,"Welcome to detention, m'kay? Mr. Garrison told me about your little joke. It's important for you all to know why you're in detention for you to obtain the full benefits from it.
"
2,6,Cartman,"You're dead, Stan.
"
2,6,Stan,"For what, dude?
"
2,6,Kenny,"(Just face it, dude, your uncle's stupid!)
"
2,6,Mr. Mackey,"You're here because you are inferior, m'kay? You are here because you are awkward, m'kay?
"
2,6,Cartman,"Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.
"
2,6,Kyle,"Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!
"
2,6,Mr. Mackey,"Shh! M'kay?
"
2,6,Stan,"Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
"
2,6,Cartman,"Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!
"
2,6,Mr. Mackey,"Shh! M'kay?
"
2,6,Kyle,"We've got to get him back, dude.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Totally.
"
2,6,Stan,"How?
"
2,6,Kyle,"Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
"
2,6,Stan,"Well, what do you mean?
"
2,6,Kyle,"Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 
"
2,6,Cartman,"Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!
"
2,6,Announcer,"And now back to Huntin' and Killin'  with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park.
"
2,6,Ned,"Aggghhh!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away.  Okay, roll the film, Tom.  Is it over? Okay, it's over.  Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show.
"
2,6,Kyle,"Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
"
2,6,Stan,"Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.
"
2,6,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.) 
"
2,6,Stan,"Yeah.
"
2,6,Kyle,"Come on! We've gotta make another one! 
"
2,6,Cartman,"Lying kicks ass!
"
2,6,Producer,"Jesus!
"
2,6,Jesus,"Yeah?
"
2,6,Producer,"We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned Show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings!
"
2,6,Jesus,"Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do?
"
2,6,Producer,"I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further.
"
2,6,Stage Hand,"And we're back in five, four, three...
"
2,6,Producer,"Remember, big, big, big!
"
2,6,Jesus,"If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle.
"
2,6,Michelle,"Well, as I was saying, I tried and tried, but my overturned car just won't budge. My husband was trapped for twelve hours.
"
2,6,Jesus,"And yet, somehow, he managed to survive.
"
2,6,Michelle,"That's right. He's a very brave man, and I love him very much.
"
2,6,Husband,"I love you, too.
"
2,6,Jesus,"W-well, let's see if the audience has any questions.  Yes, uhh, you over there. 
"
2,6,Large Woman,"I think she needs to kick him to the kerb, baby! 
"
2,6,Jesus,"Kick who to the kerb?
"
2,6,Large Woman,"Her no-good husband! She's got to lose that zero and get herself a hero! 
"
2,6,Jesus,"But--
"
2,6,Red-Haired Woman,"He wants to have his cake and eat it, too. He's got to dump that trash girlfriend.  It's all about respect. You've gotta have respect for yourself. 
"
2,6,Jesus,"Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else.  Yes, your comments.
"
2,6,African-American,"Montel, I think we're forgetting something very important in all of this. Okay, sure, he touched some children, but the man is a great singer and he has entertained us for so many years.
"
2,6,Jesus,"Wha-what are you talking about?
"
2,6,African-American,"Michael Jackson. All this baad-mouthin' and puttin' the man down. Maybe he did touch some children now and then, but come on! It's Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson! 
"
2,6,Jesus,"Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages.
"
2,6,Stan,"Ready, you guys?
"
2,6,Kyle/Cartman,"Ready. 
"
2,6,Stan,"Okay. Action! 
"
2,6,Cartman,"Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!
"
2,6,Stan,"Cut! Cartman!
"
2,6,Cartman,"What?
"
2,6,Stan,"It's supposed to be a frog!
"
2,6,Cartman,"I know that!
"
2,6,Stan,"Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?
"
2,6,Cartman,"It's a Sri Lanka frog!
"
2,6,Kyle,"Der, Cartman!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Der yourself, hippie!
"
2,6,Kyle,"Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 
"
2,6,Stan,"Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
"
2,6,Cartman,"I'm ready, Steven Spielberg! 
"
2,6,Stan,"Action!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Blulululuh. Screw you guys.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?
"
2,6,Kyle,"'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Ee-goddammit!
"
2,6,Stan,"Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
"
2,6,Cartman,"They better not!
"
2,6,Stan,"Okay, when I yell ""action"", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Scared of a plastic frog?
"
2,6,Stan,"It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
"
2,6,Cartman,"Man, this is stupid.
"
2,6,Stan,"Good. A-and action! 
"
2,6,Cartman,"Eee-ee-ee-ee! 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Well, it appears as though a lot of you ""skeptics"" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer.  Roll it!  There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!
"
2,6,Ned,"Mmmm-damn that frog.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--
"
2,6,Jimbo,"--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?
"
2,6,Producer,"Ooh, no, no, no, no!  This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever!
"
2,6,Jesus,"Uhhh, clever?
"
2,6,Producer,"It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless...
"
2,6,Jesus,"Unless what?
"
2,6,Producer,"Unless we can prove to the world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!
"
2,6,Jesus,"Look, why don't we just stick to our own show? People will watch again.
"
2,6,Producer,"Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes.
"
2,6,Jesus,"What video tapes?
"
2,6,Jesus,"Yea, children. I am the way and the light...
"
2,6,Announcer,"You've seen Jesus and Pals. Now you've got to get the video! Jesus and Pals: Too Hot for TV!  Things get a little out of control!  You won't believe your eyes!  Order now, only $19.95!  Remember, this is stuff you can't see on TV! 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Anonymous tip?
"
2,6,Tom,"Yeah, it was left on our answering machine. All it said was that they saw the Mexican staring frog just south of Stark's Pond this morning.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?
"
2,6,Tom,"You were in 'Nam? Where were you stationed?
"
2,6,Ned,"Mmm-Da Nang.
"
2,6,Cameraman,"With the log ride?
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Yep.
"
2,6,Tom,"Man, I was in Tet. We had a bad-ass roller coaster, but... all we ever wanted was a log ride. We waited and we waited, but... they never built us one. I think..Danforth wanted the log ride more than anybody, but he... he had to settle with that lame dinosaur water adventure ride.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"That war was hell on everybody. 
"
2,6,Producer,"Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Wow! Do we got more money?
"
2,6,Producer,"No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!
"
2,6,Kyle,"Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Dude, totally.
"
2,6,Stan,"They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Revenge is so very, very sweet.
"
2,6,Stan,"They're here! Hurry and hide! 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Let's hunt!
"
2,6,Producer,"We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--
"
2,6,Ned,"Mm-Jimbo, look!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Hit the deck! 
"
2,6,Producer,"What is it?
"
2,6,Jimbo,"It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.
"
2,6,Producer,"He is?
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!  Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you.
"
2,6,Ned,"Mm-roger that. 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today.  The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.  We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device  while Ned will ambush him from the rear.  Now, Ned! He's not looking!  Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!  Ned. Ne-ed?  Oh, no!  Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!  Come back to me, buddy.
"
2,6,Producer,"You getting all this? 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Hold onto your butts.  Take that, you demon frog!  Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?  Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!
"
2,6,Producer,"Get the Flight for Life helicopter! 
"
2,6,Stan,"Holy crap, dude.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"...""but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'""  Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself.  Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!
"
2,6,Stan,"Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
"
2,6,Kyle,"Look! 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!
"
2,6,Stan,"Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"What..?
"
2,6,Stan,"We shot all those videos and sent them in.
"
2,6,Kyle,"Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"You sent in those videos?!
"
2,6,Producer,"Oh, this is not good.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!
"
2,6,Kyle,"Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
"
2,6,Stan,"Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.
"
2,6,Jesus' Producer,"It's a psychosomatic response.  I couldn't help overhearing your conversation just now.
"
2,6,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
2,6,Jesus' Producer,"I produce a little TV show called Jesus and Pals, you might have heard of it. Your story is amazing; full of jealousy, duplicity, backstabbing and bitterness.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Uhhhh... Thanks?
"
2,6,Jesus' Producer,"How would you like to share your remarkable story with us on tomorrow's show?
"
2,6,Jesus,"We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they?
"
2,6,Jimbo,"That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.  Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!
"
2,6,Jesus,"Is that true, Stan?
"
2,6,Stan,"It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
"
2,6,Jesus,"Uhh, we'll find out more about this debauchery when we return. 
"
2,6,Cameraman,"A-and we're out.
"
2,6,Producer,"You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Like what?
"
2,6,Producer,"Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Satan. Got it.
"
2,6,Stan,"Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!
"
2,6,Producer,"And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Dibs!
"
2,6,Producer,"Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown. That's your cue.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Roger.
"
2,6,Jesus,"Welcome back to Jesus and Pals. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies?
"
2,6,Jimbo,"I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!
"
2,6,Audience,"Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!
"
2,6,Jesus,"Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you.
"
2,6,Stan,"Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me. 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Why, you little piece of crap!
"
2,6,Stan,"You big piece of crap!
"
2,6,Cartman,"That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!  Take that, hippie! 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Hey!
"
2,6,Audience,"Jeesus! Jeesus! 
"
2,6,Jesus,"O-okay, okay, that's enough.
"
2,6,Woman,"Take that, you asshole!  What the fuck was that?
"
2,6,Jesus,"Uh, let's watch the language, people.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Bring it on, you bitch! 
"
2,6,Cartman,"Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!
"
2,6,Audience,"Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus! 
"
2,6,Jesus,"Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
"
2,6,Kenny,"(Nononono-yikes!) 
"
2,6,Man,"Yeah, yeah, yeh-oh? 
"
2,6,Stan,"Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
2,6,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Ey, you guys! 
"
2,6,Jesus,"Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
"
2,6,Woman 1,"Oh, my God! 
"
2,6,Woman 2,"Nooooo! 
"
2,6,Jesus,"Shut the fuck up!  Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused. 
"
2,6,Stan,"W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened.
"
2,6,Stan,"Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
"
2,6,Jesus,"The entire Vietcong Army?
"
2,6,Jimbo,"I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different.
"
2,6,Jesus,"Is it?
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Well, sure. I mean, eh...  Well, no uh, I guess not.
"
2,6,Jesus,"And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and--
"
2,6,Stan,"Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
"
2,6,Jesus,"Wait. Jimbo made that up?
"
2,6,Stan,"No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
"
2,6,Jesus,"What?
"
2,6,Stan,"During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
"
2,6,Jimbo,"It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool.
"
2,6,Jesus,"Oh, really? 
"
2,6,Kyle,"Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that.
"
2,6,Man in Brown Shirt,"Screw this show. I thought this was all real. 
"
2,6,Jesus,"W-wait, everybody. Come back.
"
2,6,African-American,"Don't feel too bad, Montel. We all want to touch children sometimes; it's only natural.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble.
"
2,6,Stan,"W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
"
2,6,Kyle,"Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned? 
"
2,6,Jesus,"I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place.
"
2,6,Jimbo,"Yeah. Titties and beer.
"
2,6,Jesus,"Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--
"
2,6,Kyle,"Wait a sec. Where is your producer?
"
2,6,Jesus,"I sent her away.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Sent her away where?
"
2,6,Producer,"What is this? What's happening?!
"
2,6,Satan,"Welcome to my dominion.
"
2,6,Producer,"Oooooohhhh!
"
2,6,Saddam Hussein,"Hey. Take a load off. Put your feet up. Me and Satan were just aboot to go shopping for furniture. Come on, Satan.
"
2,6,Satan,"Okay, honey. 
"
2,6,Producer,"Noooooo! 
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"BE QUIET BACK THERRE! THESE ROADS ARE SLIICK!
"
2,7,Stan,"Hey, Cartman!
"
2,7,Cartman,"What?
"
2,7,Stan,"Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
"
2,7,Cartman,"Hmmm, let me see. No!
"
2,7,Kyle,"Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
"
2,7,Stan,"Give us some, Cartman!
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"BE QUIET BACK THERRE!
"
2,7,Kyle,"Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, the road is always snowy.
"
2,7,Kyle,"I know, but, it's really snowy today.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can. 
"
2,7,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Okay, that does it! Y'all be quiet or the cute little bunny dies! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Oh, she would, dude. She would. 
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"GOODD!  OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
"
2,7,Cartman,"I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"WHAT DID YOU SAY?!  Whoa oh.  Hold oonn! Aaaaa! 
"
2,7,Kids,"Aaaah!
"
2,7,Kyle,"I'm scared!
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"BE QUIET, KID! 
"
2,7,All,"Aaaah!
"
2,7,Guide,"...Aand right up here you can see a red-bellied chickadee. They're indigenous to this area. 
"
2,7,The Kids,"Aaaah!
"
2,7,Wife,"What was that?
"
2,7,Guide,"What was what?
"
2,7,All,"Aaaah- 
"
2,7,Cartman,"All done!
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!  I SAID 'QUIET,' OR ELSE I KILL THE BUNNY! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Where are we?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"I have no idea.
"
2,7,Stan,"I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Yeah, what are we supposed to do?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Just keep your trap shut. I'll consult the manual. 
"
2,7,Cartman,"Ms. Crabtree?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"SHUT UP, KIID! I HAVE TO WATCH A TRAINING VIDEO!
"
2,7,Trainer,"Welcome to tape 7 of the bus driver's video guidebook. What to do if you become stranded. By now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' technique. Now, it's time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, 'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.'
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!
"
2,7,Trainer,"That's right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bus driver's code: 'Sit down. And shut up!'
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"I'm goin' for help. Ah'll be back as soon as I can. Remember. Don't get off this bus, or a big scary monster WILL EAT YOU! 
"
2,7,Boy In The Red Shirt,"Hey, why doesn't the scary monster eat her?
"
2,7,Kyle,"'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
"
2,7,Kyle,"I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Oh.
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Had to happen to me, didn't it? 
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too-
Whoa uhih, it's supper time. Come to poppa.  Whoa uh heh hello, little lady-yeh. Goin' my way?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"SHUT UP AND HELP ME INTO THIS THIING!
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Whoa. Hehum huh.
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Yeah!  COME ON! I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY!
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Uh huh. Alright, sure, of course. 
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"TAKE ME TO THE NEAREST TOWN AND MAKE IT SNAPPY, YOUFREAK-ASS CRACKPOT!
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Uuuh, yeh, yes ma'am. Righta right away, ma'am.  So uh... Uhwhat's a- fragile little doe like yourself doin' out on a, on a night like this?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"LOOK, MISTER, I GOT A BUSLOAD OF KIDS TRAPPED UP ON THAT PASS! I NEED A CRANE, HELICOPTERS, ALL THAT CRAP! HERE, LET ME HAVE SOME O' YOUR ASPIRIN! 
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Uh uh- ma'am, those are actually roofies.
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"ROOFIES, ASPIRIN, RIGHT NOW I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS!  HOW FAR TO THE NEAREST TOOWWN?!
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Mm-... mm-it's a ways.
"
2,7,Cartman,"You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever.
"
2,7,Kids,"What? Huh?
"
2,7,Kyle,"We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude!
"
2,7,Kyle,"What?
"
2,7,Cartman,"I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes!  You guys suck!
"
2,7,Stan,"Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Worse than this?
"
2,7,Stan,"Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Oh, man, this sucks.
"
2,7,Kyle,"How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
"
2,7,Stan,"I think we have to signal them somehow.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Ow!
"
2,7,Wendy,"Hey, he's like Rudolph.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Sure you do!
"
2,7,Stan,"Come on Cartman, fart!
"
2,7,Cartman,"I don't wanna.
"
2,7,Stan,"He can't hold it in forever.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Fart, damn you!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?! 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Whoa, look at that.
"
2,7,Cartman,"It's completely immature! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
"
2,7,Cartman,"You guys can't scare me!
"
2,7,Stan,"Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
"
2,7,Stan,"Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 
"
2,7,Wendy,"Mmmm.
"
2,7,Stan,"Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2,7,Kyle,"You can say that again.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Was that how it happened?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"STOOPP! LET ME OFF, YOU TURD!
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Hey. Uh I wanna help you. Uh, I care a lot about that bus full of uuh- what was it again?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Children.
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Yeah right. Leh, let me come with you. 
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"WHO- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAAP?!
"
2,7,Carrot Ass,"I hate flyin'. Talk about somethin' I hate, it's flyin'.
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Say uuhh, are those roofies kickin' in yet?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"WELL, I DON'T THINK SO!
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Damn!
"
2,7,Carrot Ass,"D'you guys like impressions?
"
2,7,Patron,"No!

2,7,Talent Scout,"Baby, you're wonderful! You're a natural! You're the funniest comic I've seen in yeauhs!
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP. I'VE GOT TO GET SOME ASSISTANCE FOR MY BROKEN-DOWN BUUSS!!
"
2,7,Talent Scout,"Broken-down bus! That's great! Great angle!
"
2,7,Stan,"Do you see 'er dude?
"
2,7,Kyle,"Nope.
"
2,7,Cartman,"God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?
"
2,7,Boy In The Red Shirt,"She's never coming back. Don't you get it? She left us here to die like pigs.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny.
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Huh?)
"
2,7,Boy In The Red Shirt,"I can't take it anymore! I have to get out of here! 
"
2,7,Stan,"No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
"
2,7,Boy In The Red Shirt,"Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Don't do it, kid. 
"
2,7,Stan,"Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
"
2,7,Boy In The Red Shirt,"Nooooo-agh! 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Holy crap, dude! 
"
2,7,Bebe,"Gross! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
"
2,7,Liane,"Hello?
"
2,7,Sharon,"Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother.
"
2,7,Liane,"Oh yes, Sharon. How are you?
"
2,7,Sharon,"Ms. Cartman, is your son at home?
"
2,7,Liane,"Hu-old on, dear, let me check.  Hon, I made beefy logs.  I made Cookie Dings.  No, he's not here.
"
2,7,Sharon,"Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are.
"
2,7,Liane,"Oh, dear!
"
2,7,Talent Scout,"I'm telling you, Marty, this woman is a natural! I haven't seen a funnier person since Maury Povich.
"
2,7,Marty,"What's her angle?
"
2,7,Talent Scout,"I can't even explain it. You have to see it.
"
2,7,Marty,"Alright. Well, this better be good.
"
2,7,Talent Scout,"Come on in, come on in.
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"WHUAT THE HELL DID YOU BRING ME TO DENVER FOR, YOU BRAIN-DEPRAVED FECOPHILIAC?!
"
2,7,Talent Scout,"Mr. Jonus, this is Mrs. Crabtree.
"
2,7,Marty,"Pleasure to meet you.
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"YOU LOOK LIKE A LUMP OF DOGSHIT JUST GOT HIT BY A CAR!!
"
2,7,Talent Scout,"What did I tell you?
"
2,7,Marty,"She's fantastic. How would you like to make a million dollars, baby?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUCK MY ASS?!
"
2,7,Marty,"Let's get started right away.
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Are you gonna be all right?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"DON'T TOUCH ME!
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Uh ah-I'm sorry. Do you need anything?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"No. I just...
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"What?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"I can't help but feel that I've forgotten somethin'.
"
2,7,Stan,"What time is it?
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Almost 7:30)
"
2,7,Kyle,"On Wednesday or Thursday?
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, I think it's Saturday now.
"
2,7,Cartman,"What?! I'm missing the new Fantasy Island.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
"
2,7,Stan,"Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
"
2,7,Cartman,"What do you think it is?
"
2,7,Stan,"I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt. 
"
2,7,Stan,"What?
"
2,7,Kyle,"Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
"
2,7,Boys,"Aaaaaa!
"
2,7,Jimbo,"The lava's comin' right for us!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Heellp! 
"
2,7,Jimbo,"Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!
"
2,7,Cartman,"What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
"
2,7,Kyle,"Oh my God! Look at his leg!
"
2,7,Brent Musberger,"Hi kids, I'm TV's Brent Musberger.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
"
2,7,All,"Aaaa!
"
2,7,Jimbo,"Quick Ned, shoot it!
"
2,7,Ned,"Mmm. Oh no, out of ammo.
"
2,7,Stan,"Hey, look!
"
2,7,Scuzzlebutt,"Grrrr. 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Dude! He's making ice cream. 
"
2,7,Cartman,"Scuzzlebutt kicks ass!
"
2,7,Kyle,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2,7,Stan,"Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?
"
2,7,Mayor,"Here she comes! 
"
2,7,Mr. Garrison,"Come on you little bitch. 
"
2,7,Mayor,"It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park. 
"
2,7,Kathie Lee,"Thank you. 
"
2,7,Stan,"Mr. Garrison, stop!
"
2,7,Mr. Garrison,"Leave us. We must finish what we have begun. 
"
2,7,Wendy,"But Mr. Garrison!
"
2,7,Mr. Garrison,"She's not really Kathie Lee Gifford. She's some kinda alien. 
"
2,7,Kathie Lee,"Thank you. And I love you all. 
"
2,7,Alien,"Naawwr! 
"
2,7,Mr. Garrison,"See, I told ya. 
"
2,7,Wendy,"Mmmm.
"
2,7,Mayor,"Wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day.  Let's have ice cream, everyone! 
"
2,7,Cartman,"Beefcaake!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2,7,Stan,"But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Oh, yeah.
"
2,7,Announcer,"Live from Burbank, it's The Tonight Show, with Jay Leno. Tonight, Jay's special guests include: Washed-up Actress from a sitcom. And the comedy of Mrs. Crabtree. And now, here's your host, Jay Leno. 
"
2,7,Talent Scout,"Just relax, sweetheart, you're gonna kill out there.
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"KILL WHO?!
"
2,7,Talent Scout,"Huh that's great. Use that. 
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Honey du-, do you need anything?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE OF THEM ROOFIES.
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Sure. 
"
2,7,Mr. Mackey,"Oh oh okay? Let's try to calm down, nkay? This type of thing happens all the time.
"
2,7,Sharon,"What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?!
"
2,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well, 99% of the time, when a child is missing, it's because they've run away. M'kay? 
"
2,7,Sharon,"Run away?
"
2,7,Sheila,"Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah.
"
2,7,Randy,"How do we get our runaway children back?
"
2,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well, we just need to make some posters, nkay? Hand out brochures, onkay? That way, the public can know what the chldren look like and can call in if thry're spotted, m'kay?
"
2,7,Sharon,"Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now.
"
2,7,Sheila,"It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.
"
2,7,Man 1,"Come on, everybody!
"
2,7,Man 2,"We've got to find those kids!
"
2,7,Man 1,"If we all put our heads together, we can find them!
"
2,7,Man 2,"We can do it! 
"
2,7,Man 3,"Hi. 
"
2,7,Stan,"What was that?
"
2,7,Kyle,"What was what?
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
"
2,7,Kyle,"What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)
"
2,7,Kyle,"Hey yeah, I remember that.
"
2,7,Kenny,"(All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.)
"
2,7,Kids,"Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah! 
"
2,7,Marvin,"Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
"
2,7,Kids,"Aaaah!
"
2,7,Kyle,"Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
"
2,7,Marvin,"Come over here you son of a whore! 
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Take... that!)  (You dick! That is for me, and that, that and that, that and that, that, that, that!) 
"
2,7,Stan,"Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
"
2,7,Kyle,"You... bastard? 
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!) 
"
2,7,Stan,"Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Oh, yeah)
"
2,7,Kyle,"Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 
"
2,7,Kids,"AAAAH! 
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!) 
"
2,7,Stan,"Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!
"
2,7,Kyle,"You bastard!
"
2,7,Stan,"Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ALL STARIN' AT?!  STOP LAUGHING, YOU WHORES!!  I SAID, SHUT UP!! 
"
2,7,Jay Leno,"Let's hear it for Ms. Crabtree. What an up-and-comer!
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Well. That was great, ma'am.
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Was it? Does it even matter?
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Wwhat do ya mean?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Success is hollow, Mitch, hollow like a dead tree. I think it's time for me to give it up.
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Are you sure?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Ah-I'm sure. Let's get a cup of coffee. 
"
2,7,Cartman,"I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again? 
"
2,7,Kyle,"We've just gotta stick together.
"
2,7,Stan,"Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Hay, wait a minute.
"
2,7,Stan,"What?
"
2,7,Cartman,"Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?
"
2,7,Joanie Cunningham,"Go, Fonzie!
"
2,7,Fonzie,"Eeeeyyyy! 
"
2,7,Cartman,"You can do it, Fonzie.
"
2,7,Stan,"We believe in you, Fonz.
"
2,7,Fonzie,"Eeeeyyyy! 
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Hey, that freakin' bike-!) 
"
2,7,Fonzie,"Eeyy! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
2,7,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.
"
2,7,Stan,"You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
"
2,7,Kyle,"Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
"
2,7,Cartman,"Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense. 
"
2,7,Stan,"Oh no! 
"
2,7,Kids,"Aaaah!
"
2,7,Kyle,"What are we gonna do?
"
2,7,Kids,"Aaaah! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 
"
2,7,Kyle,"There.  I think we got it.
"
2,7,Stan,"I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
"
2,7,Cartman,"It does?
"
2,7,Kyle,"Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
"
2,7,Boy In The Red Shirt,"Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Don't do it, kid. 
"
2,7,Stan,"Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
"
2,7,Boy In The Red Shirt,"Nooooo-agh! 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
"
2,7,Kids,"Hooray!  Yea!  Aaah!  Yea! Ha ha. 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Wow, this is gorgeous. I don't think I've ever seen anything so beautiful.
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"From a distance, this place looks like a cold, damp marsh. But once you get inside it,  you realize that it has an inner beauty, far surpassing others.  Thank you for sharing your time with me, Ms. Crabtree.
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Please. Call me Muffin. 
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"I'm having a nice time, Muffin.
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Me too, Marcus. I've forgotten all about my cares in the world.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
"
2,7,Stan,"Hey yeah! 
"
2,7,Tom,"...And all over America, kids are turning to the streets and running away. Tonight, a very special message from the parents of some runaway children, in hopes that their young will hear their cries.
"
2,7,Randy,"Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.  Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. 
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold
"
2,7,Kyle,"Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! 
"
2,7,Gerald,"Please come home, Kyle. 
You left home lookin' for somethin' new. 
But all you need is right here waitin' for you 
"
2,7,The Parents,"Runaway, come home. We love you just as you are.
Runaway, come home. We're sorry things went this far.
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
"
2,7,Clyde,"I hope my dad doesn't sing.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was?
"
2,7,Stan,"Boy, do I!
"
2,7,Mephesto,"Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... John Elway. 
"
2,7,Cartman,"Sweeeeeett! 
"
2,7,John Elway,"Uh oh.
"
2,7,Cartman,"This kicks ass, you guys! John Elway is my father! 
My father is John Elway, my father is John Elway
Deedun, Deedun.
"
2,7,John Elway,"Come on, son. I'll buy you some ice cream. 
"
2,7,Cartman,"Now, that's what I call a sti-
"
2,7,Kyle,"Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
"
2,7,Cartman,"What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Cartman, no! 
"
2,7,Kids,"Aaaaaa!
"
2,7,Stan,"The bus is going over!
"
2,7,Kyle,"Oh no!
"
2,7,Kids,"Aaaaa. Aaaaaaa. 
"
2,7,Kids,"Aaaaa! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
"
2,7,Kids,"Hooray!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Wait, wait wait wait. This doesn't make sense. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I must be-
"
2,7,Cartman,"Deah, eh eh.  Oh man, what a weird dream!
"
2,7,Liane,"Ah-are you okay, hon?
"
2,7,Cartman,"Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream.
"
2,7,Liane,"Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast? 
"
2,7,Cartman,"Yes, please. 
"
2,7,Liane,"Mmmm.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Mmmm.  Mmmm.
"
2,7,Liane,"Mmmm. Beetles are good with ice cream.
"
2,7,Stan,"GAAA-uh.  Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare. 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Hello?
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Really?
"
2,7,Stan,"Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.
"
2,7,Stan,"Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
"
2,7,Stan,"Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"I want to thank you for making me feel alive again, Marcus.
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Ms. Crabtree?
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"What is it? What's wrong?
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"You realize I can't stay. None of this is real: it's... it's all been a little eight-year old's dream.
"
2,7,Ms. Crabtree,"Oh I know. I know, Marcus. But let me just pretend as long as I can.
"
2,7,Truck Driver,"Sure. 
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?  Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!  The prank is over!  You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch.  God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?! 
"
2,8,Kids,"Yea--
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!
"
2,8,Kids,"Awww..!
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!  Okay. I'm going to turn around now.  Shit!
"
2,8,Pip,"Where did everybody go?
"
2,8,Kids,"Yea!/Hooray!/Summer!
"
2,8,Mother,"Oh golly, Kevin, honey.
"
2,8,Father,"Good to see you again, son.
"
2,8,Man,"Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready. 
"
2,8,Pip,"Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!
"
2,8,Stan,"Shut up, Pip.
"
2,8,Pip,"Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?
"
2,8,Kyle,"What do you mean?
"
2,8,Pip,"Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip! 
"
2,8,Stan,"Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
"
2,8,Kyle,"I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
"
2,8,Stan,"I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!
"
2,8,Stan,"Jesus, Cartman!
"
2,8,Cartman,"Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na.
"
2,8,Stu,"Hi, fellas.
"
2,8,Boys,"Hi, Stu.
"
2,8,Stu,"What can I do for you?
"
2,8,Kyle,"We wanna buy M-80s.
"
2,8,Stan,"The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Okay, that's it!  Screw you guys! I'm going home. 
"
2,8,Kyle,"What a baby.
"
2,8,Stan,"So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.
"
2,8,Stu,"I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?
"
2,8,Stan,"Heard what?
"
2,8,Stu,"All fireworks have been banned in Colorado.
"
2,8,Kyle,"What do ya mean?
"
2,8,Stu,"It was in the paper this morning. 
"
2,8,Kyle,"Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
"
2,8,Stu,"Right.
"
2,8,Stan,"How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
"
2,8,Stan,"Oh gosh, killed Kenny!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Oo bastards! 
"
2,8,Stan,"A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
"
2,8,Stu,"I can still sell snakes. 
"
2,8,Stan/Kyle/ Kenny,"Awww..!
"
2,8,Mayor,"This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake.  I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call.  Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems!  Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smartass, I was being ironic..! 
"
2,8,Barbrady,"I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat.
"
2,8,Mayor,"Well, keep looking. 
"
2,8,Barbrady,"Oh?
"
2,8,Mayor,"This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
"
2,8,Barbrady,"Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow.
"
2,8,Mayor,"Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa--  Oooooogh...
"
2,8,Barbrady,"I found him.
"
2,8,Stan,"Man, it's hot out here.
"
2,8,Cartman,"What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
"
2,8,Stan,"I know! Let's go sledding!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
2,8,Stan,"Come on, Cartman, get on.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Stan?
"
2,8,Kyle,"Let's go, dude. We're ready.
"
2,8,Stan,"What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
"
2,8,Cartman,"Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
"
2,8,Cartman,"Ugh... Whatever. 
"
2,8,Stan,"What the hell is going on? 
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Hey there, boys!
"
2,8,Stan,"Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"What?!
"
2,8,Stan,"Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Oh my God!  Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case.  Buckle your seat belt, Ned.
"
2,8,Ned,"Mmmm-where are we going?
"
2,8,Jimbo,"México, my amigo.
"
2,8,Ned,"Mmmm-why are we going to México?
"
2,8,Jimbo,"To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?
"
2,8,Ned,"Are fireworks legal in Mexico?
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way. 
"
2,8,Charlie,"At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence.  Our focus is on safety while--
"
2,8,Mayor,"Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
"
2,8,Charlie,"Oh, o-kay.  Let's see...  Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake.
"
2,8,Mayor,"Ooooh!
"
2,8,Charlie,"We'll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake.
"
2,8,Mayor,"Comanche helicopters...
"
2,8,Charlie,"Then we'll need 57 flamethrowers, all set up around the perimeter of the disk, that are all triggered to fire at the same time.
"
2,8,Mayor,"...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time...
"
2,8,Charlie,"Once lit, the snake will grow.  And good times will be had by all. 
"
2,8,Aide 1,"Wonderful.
"
2,8,Aide 2,"Spectacular.
"
2,8,Mayor,"Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!
"
2,8,Aide 1,"Hey! How about the elementary school orchestra? They had a great version of Mary Had a Little Lamb at their last concert.
"
2,8,Mayor,"Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
"
2,8,Aide 2,"Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam?
"
2,8,Mayor,"Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Dusty the dirtball
"
2,8,Stan,"Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
"
2,8,Kyle,"Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Hello, children. How is your summer going?
"
2,8,Stan,"Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat.
"
2,8,Stan,"That's good. 
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Hat is just a puppet.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yup. 
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Hat isn't real.
"
2,8,Stan,"Right. 
"
2,8,Cartman,"Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come? 
"
2,8,Stan,"Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
"
2,8,Cartman,"It is not!
"
2,8,Stan,"Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
"
2,8,Cartman,"I am not swimming around in pee!
"
2,8,Stan,"Whatever, dude.
"
2,8,Cartman,"My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.
"
2,8,Cartman,"I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
"
2,8,Stan,"But Cartman, we're trying to--
"
2,8,Cartman,"Uh, screw you guys. Home. 
"
2,8,Stan,"What does he mean, ""living in denial""?
"
2,8,Kyle,"Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
"
2,8,Stan,"There, how does that look?
"
2,8,Kyle,"Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
"
2,8,Stan,"Uh, crap..!
"
2,8,Cartman,"Eh-eh-eh-eh... 
"
2,8,Instructor,"Okay kids, everyone in the pool!  Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Nuh-uh.
"
2,8,Instructor,"Just jump in.
"
2,8,Cartman,"I don't wanna.
"
2,8,Instructor,"It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it. 
"
2,8,Cartman,"Egh-- 
"
2,8,Instructor,"There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Huh? First graders?  Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!
"
2,8,Mayor,"Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
"
2,8,Aide 2,"I'm sure it'll be here any second.
"
2,8,Mayor,"Shut up!
"
2,8,Aide 2,"Copy that.
"
2,8,Conductor,"Okay, children, I'm sure we're a little rusty. Where is Eric Cartman?
"
2,8,Stan,"He's taking swimming lessons.
"
2,8,Conductor,"Oh, dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our French horn section? Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And...  Okay, that was pretty good. Let's play Mozart's Symphony No. 5. 
"
2,8,Mayor,"Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.  Wait a minute... It's the snake! 
"
2,8,Barbrady,"Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all.
"
2,8,Mayor,"Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr.
"
2,8,Proprietor,"¿Qué?
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr.
"
2,8,Proprietor,"¿Necesita usted un cohete grande?
"
2,8,Ned,"Nnnn-no moleste el gato spectacularrrr. 
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone.
"
2,8,Ned,"Mmmm-they're spectacularrrr.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July.  We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.
"
2,8,Ned,"Hmmm-bueyno.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Hello?
"
2,8,Caller,"Hello, is Mr. Hat there?
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Is this some kind of joke?
"
2,8,Caller,"Yes.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!
"
2,8,Caller,"I don't think you can, m'kay.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Goddammit..! 
"
2,8,Shari,"So, Lamb Chop, what would you like to do today?
"
2,8,Lamb Chop,"Well, I'd like to sing you a song.
"
2,8,Shari,"Hey, let's sing one to-gether!
"
2,8,Lamb Chop,"As long as we're together, we can do anythingWe can take on the whole darn worldWe're happy as clams, with plenty of pearlsThrough thick and thin, we've always been to-geth-er...
"
2,8,Shari,"Whoa-aagghh! Aagghh! Aggh!  No! Lamb Chop, no!
"
2,8,Lamb Chop,"Shari, help me... It burns! It burns..!
"
2,8,Instructor,"Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Later's fine.
"
2,8,Instructor,"Just do your side stroke.
"
2,8,Cartman,"I only know how to do it doggie style.
"
2,8,Instructor,"That's doggie-paddle, Eric. Now come over here!
"
2,8,Cartman,"Can I do it doggie style?
"
2,8,Instructor,"Okay.  That's it! That's it, you can do it!
"
2,8,Cartman,"Sweet..!  Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!
"
2,8,Instructor,"Come on, Eric!
"
2,8,Cartman,"No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
"
2,8,Anchor,"Fourth of July is finally here, and with the state-wide ban on fireworks, people from all over Colorado are flocking to South Park. Here with a special report is a normal-looking guy with a funny name.
"
2,8,Creamy Goodness,"Thanks, Tom. It looks like the firework ban won't be putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight. I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history.  Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us.  Alrighty then, looks like we're ready.
"
2,8,Stan,"How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?
"
2,8,Cartman,"Fine.
"
2,8,Kyle,"I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Well, you heard wrong, hippie!
"
2,8,Mayor,"Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!
"
2,8,Conductor,"This is it. And a-one and a-two and a... 
"
2,8,Audience,"Ooohhhh..!
"
2,8,Mayor,"What is fuck is that?!
"
2,8,Aide 2,"I think it's The Stars and Stripes.
"
2,8,Mayor,"Oh, hell. Light the snake! 
"
2,8,Audience,"Ooooooh!  Ahhhhh! 
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.  I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it? 
"
2,8,Guard,"Good evening, gentlemen.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland.
"
2,8,Guard,"Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Fire away, we have nothing to hide.
"
2,8,Guard,"Is anyone other than the two of you traveling in this vehicle?
"
2,8,Jimbo,"No, sir.
"
2,8,Guard,"Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Yes.  I mean, no! No!
"
2,8,Guard,"Open your trunk, please, sir. 
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
"
2,8,Mayor,"My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.  Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?
"
2,8,Charlie,"Die out?
"
2,8,Mayor,"Yes, you know, expire, end.  Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?
"
2,8,Charlie,"Uhhh, I'm not sure; I never made one this big.  I guess we didn't quite think this through, did we?
"
2,8,Mayor,"What?!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Dude! That thing is huge!
"
2,8,Stan,"Yeah, they need to shut it off.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song! 
"
2,8,Man 1,"Somebody stop it!
"
2,8,Man 2,"It's out of control! 
"
2,8,Stan/Kyle/ Cartman,"Aarrgghh!! 
"
2,8,Kyle,"Kenny! Watch out! 
"
2,8,Kenny,"(Waarrggh!!)  (Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!) 
"
2,8,Stan,"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
"
2,8,Kyle,"You bastard!
"
2,8,Mayor,"Oh my God!  You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!
"
2,8,Charlie,"Let's see. A normal-size snake lasts three minutes... 
"
2,8,Mayor,"So when does it run out?!
"
2,8,Charlie,"November. Of next year.
"
2,8,Mayor,"Oh, hell..! 
"
2,8,Creamy Goodness,"Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping. Residents have tried everything from firehoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop, but nothing seems to work.
"
2,8,Tom,"Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future.
"
2,8,Stan,"Man, this sucks.
"
2,8,Kyle,"What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
"
2,8,Stan,"We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Where is Chef?
"
2,8,Chef,"Baby, you know you're the girl for me-eeAnd all that I want to be-ee-ee is... You and meAnd her; simultaneousYou and me, and you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three; simultaneousOoh, that's right... Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what? A giant snake? Killing everybody?! Growing bigger?! Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, futch ya. Simultaneous, you and meAnd you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three...
"
2,8,Kyle,"What'd he say?
"
2,8,Stan,"Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Wow.
"
2,8,Kyle,"How is that gonna help?
"
2,8,Anchor,"All over America, the effects of the giant ash snake of South Park can be seen. 
"
2,8,Preacher,"Yea, let the spirit of Heavenly Father be blessed upon you. 
"
2,8,Assistant,"From this day on, all will be well. 
"
2,8,New Mormon,"I already feel like things are getting better. 
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"And I can't sleep or think...  Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?
"
2,8,Dr. Katz,"Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think… Mr. Hat… went?
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?
"
2,8,Dr. Katz,"Well… I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning.
"
2,8,Dr. Katz,"Um... Ahem...  Are you gay?
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"What?!
"
2,8,Dr. Katz,"It-it's j-just-- It's just a question.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Are you propositioning me?
"
2,8,Dr. Katz,"No.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not gay!
"
2,8,Dr. Katz,"Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Hat, on the other hand...
"
2,8,Dr. Katz,"Mr. Hat was gay?
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations.
"
2,8,Dr. Katz,"I see.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing.
"
2,8,Dr. Katz,"That I did not need to know.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I'm just sayin'.
"
2,8,Dr. Katz,"Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet.  What do you think about that?
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"I think you're the loony one in this room.  Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again.
"
2,8,Ned,"Mmmmmmm-yup.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.
"
2,8,Ned,"Mmm-well better luck next year.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again.
"
2,8,Ned,"Mmmm-is anyone other than the two of you riding in this vehicle?
"
2,8,Jimbo,"No.
"
2,8,Ned,"Mmmm-do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Yes?  Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?  Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
"
2,8,Ned,"Mmm-it looks like my ex-wife!
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!
"
2,8,Brett Favre,"Hi. I hasn't seen you in here before. 
"
2,8,Reporter,"As more and more cities are affected by the growing ash and the death toll rises to 3,000,  people from all over the country are looking to the Mayor of South Park for answers.  And it appears as if the Mayor is going to explain matters now.
"
2,8,Aide 1,"Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of South Park regrets that she cannot be here herself, but she is… sick.
"
2,8,Reporter 2,"""Sick""?! What kind of lame excuse is that?
"
2,8,Print Reporter,"You gotta be kidding me!
"
2,8,Reporter 3,"Oh, this is ridiculous!
"
2,8,Reporter 4,"Come on, we want answers.
"
2,8,Aide 2,"Sh-she's having her period. 
"
2,8,Reporter 4,"Oh.
"
2,8,Aide 1,"We do, however, have an official statement for all the concerned cities about the matter with the giant snake that we can't seem to put out.
"
2,8,Aide 2,"""We're sorry. Our bad.""
"
2,8,Aide 1,"Thank you, that is all. 
"
2,8,Cartman,"Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.  Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it. 
"
2,8,Stan,"How many days left in summer?
"
2,8,Kyle,"A lot, I think.
"
2,8,Stan,"Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
"
2,8,Kyle,"I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Buenos gracias, boys.
"
2,8,Stan,"Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Oh, now, why the long faces?
"
2,8,Kyle,"We're bored.
"
2,8,Stan,"There's nothin' to do.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Well, I don't think those are problems  that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!
"
2,8,Stan/Kyle,"Hooray!
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.  Point 'em away from your eyes, now.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Wow! These are huge!
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child.
"
2,8,Stan,"Hey, look! We blew up the snake! 
"
2,8,Citizen,"All the ash from the snake is putting the flame out.
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!
"
2,8,Stan/Kyle,"Hooray! 
"
2,8,Cartman,"I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.  I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!
"
2,8,Instructor,"The snake's been destroyed.  The pool's open!
"
2,8,Cartman,"Huh?  Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..! 
"
2,8,Citizen 2,"Look! They put out the snake! 
"
2,8,Mayor,"Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly. 
"
2,8,Kyle,"Hey, look! It's snowing! 
"
2,8,Jimbo,"Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell. 
"
2,8,Stan,"Winter's back!
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Wow, it's a black blizzard!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig.
"
2,8,Mr. Twig,"That's right, children. I'll see you in the fall.
"
2,8,Stan,"Well, I can hardly wait.
"
2,8,Chef,"Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..? 
"
2,8,Stan,"Hey, Chef!
"
2,8,Cartman,"How's it going? 
"
2,8,Man,"Howdy, Chef. How was your summer vacation? 
"
2,8,Chef,"Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!
"
2,9,Robert Redford,"Why do we hold the Sundance Film Festival here, Phyllis? It's so painfully crowded.
"
2,9,Phyllis,"Because. People from L.A. love to come to a quaint little mountain town for a few days, and this gives them an excuse.
"
2,9,Robert Redford,"No, this used to be a quaint little mountain town. Now look at it. Sushi restaurants, upscale clothes stores, $25 parking, Liam Neeson... I tell you, Phyllis, I think we've tapped this town's resources out. We must move the festival to another small mountain town and begin again.
"
2,9,Phyllis,"That's not a bad idea. But where?
"
2,9,Man in background,"Ching ching cha-ching.
"
2,9,Man in foreground,"Whoa.
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?
"
2,9,Mr. Twig,"That's right, Mr. Garrison. The First Annual South Park Film Festival begins today.
"
2,9,Wendy,"Wow! Cool!
"
2,9,Kyle,"They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"Nono, Kyle. These are independent films.
"
2,9,Stan,"Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
"
2,9,Cartman,"No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.
"
2,9,Wendy,"No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that  isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!
"
2,9,Wendy,"Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!
"
2,9,Cartman,"I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!
"
2,9,Wendy,"Hrmph!
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office!
"
2,9,Cartman,"...bitch.
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"That's it Eric, you-!
"
2,9,Cartman,"I'm going! 
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it.  The first film showing is called Witness To Denial, and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love.
"
2,9,Stan,"Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
"
2,9,Director 1,"Norma, I want to shoot the script next month with Demi Moore instead.
"
2,9,Director 2,"Well you can tell Spielberg he can kiss my ass!
"
2,9,Mayor,"Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city.
"
2,9,Cartman,"I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
"
2,9,Stan,"She's not my girlfriend.
"
2,9,Kenny,"(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.) 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Sick, Kenny.
"
2,9,Stan,"Damn, dude. Look at all these people.
"
2,9,Director 3,"I'm late for a screening, I'll call you from the theater.
"
2,9,Kyle,"All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
"
2,9,Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
2,9,The boys,"Hey, Chef.
"
2,9,Stan,"Whatcha doin'?
"
2,9,Chef,"Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!
"
2,9,Cartman,"What kind of cookies?
"
2,9,Stan,"Calm down, tubby.
"
2,9,Chef,"They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, ""Fudge 'Ems"" 
"
2,9,Cartman,"I wanna Fudge 'Em.
"
2,9,Chef,"I can just see the commercial now. ""Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems.""
"
2,9,Kyle,"Cool!
"
2,9,Chef,"And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, ""Fudge This.""
"
2,9,Director 3,"Oh look, one of the natives is selling local food wares. How quaint.
"
2,9,Woman,"This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture.
"
2,9,Chef,"Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, ""Go Fudge Yourself,"" or my all-natural, ""I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge.""
"
2,9,Woman,"Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?
"
2,9,Chef,"Huh?
"
2,9,Director 3,"I would kill for some cous cous right now.
"
2,9,Chef,"Whose goose?
"
2,9,Woman,"Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A.
"
2,9,Director 3,"Cute sign, though. 
"
2,9,Wendy,"Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?
"
2,9,Cartman,"Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?
"
2,9,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
"
2,9,Cartman,"She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.
"
2,9,Kyle,"If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
"
2,9,Chef,"Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! ""I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!""
"
2,9,Cartman,"Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground.
"
2,9,Stan,"When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
"
2,9,Wendy,"Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them.
"
2,9,Stan,"They what?!
"
2,9,Candice,"Who are you to judge my womanly soul?  The Goddess flames that burn in my memory aren't dark. Dare you call them dark!  Here lies the Goddess truth of my body.
"
2,9,Stan,"Oh, brother.
"
2,9,Candice,"The Goddess that cries, ""Freedom!""  Here is the Goddess truth of my womanly being  You are my blossom, my flame. When we make love, it's like the sun is right outside the door.
"
2,9,Her Blossom,"Then make love to me, right now. 
"
2,9,Stan,"Dude!
"
2,9,Wendy,"Sshh!
"
2,9,Stan,"Dude!
"
2,9,Kyle,"I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-
"
2,9,Sheila,"Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!
"
2,9,Kyle,"I'm poopies, ma!
"
2,9,Sheila,"Well, hurry up!
"
2,9,Kyle,"Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Ky-yle! Ky-yle!
"
2,9,Kyle,"Could it be?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Hooowwwdy ho! 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
"
2,9,Tom,"I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens,  except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town  and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
"
2,9,Cartman,"Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Well, I'm sure it was him.
"
2,9,Man,"Look, look! Here comes somebody! 
"
2,9,A woman,"Move aside, I can't see.
"
2,9,Tom,"Ladies and gentlemen, TV's Fred Savage. 
"
2,9,Crowd,"AAWWWW! 
"
2,9,Tom,"Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon.
"
2,9,Kyle,"So how was that movie last night, dude?
"
2,9,Stan,"Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!
"
2,9,Cartman,"It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?
"
2,9,Stan,"Yeah, pretty much.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
2,9,Stan,"The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
"
2,9,Cartman,"Ay!
"
2,9,Stan,"Dude, now that'd be like IMAX. 
"
2,9,Cartman,"Okay, that's enough fatass jokes for this week.
"
2,9,Kenny,"(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh) 
"
2,9,Cartman,"Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Well?
"
2,9,Cartman,"I'm gonna, just give me a minute.
"
2,9,Robert Redford,"This is perfect. Why didn't we think of it sooner? This town still has some charm left, not the mess we turned Park City into.
"
2,9,Phyllis,"Forgive me for being observant, but, won't we just end up doing the same thing to this town?
"
2,9,Robert Redford,"Yes. And the town after, and the town after that. Like termites, we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up. And then move on, until every quiet mountain town is like Los Angeles.
"
2,9,Phyllis,"Why? Why would we do such a thing?
"
2,9,Robert Redford,"Because we have to live in L.A. And if we can't live in quiet, simple, peaceful mountain towns, then nobody will!  Waitwaitwait. Zoom in to a close-up of my face when I do that. Ready? Then NOBODY will!  That's it.
"
2,9,Chef,"Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, ""Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls."" 
"
2,9,Stan,"Are they good?
"
2,9,Chef,"Try 'em. 
"
2,9,Stan,"Hey, dude, these are good!
"
2,9,Cartman,"Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef. 
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Ky-yle!
"
2,9,Kyle,"There it is again! 
"
2,9,Stan,"There is what again? 
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Ky-yle!
"
2,9,Kyle,"It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 
"
2,9,Stan,"Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Where does that grill go?
"
2,9,Stan,"To the sewer, dude.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!
"
2,9,Chef,"Hey, everybody, have you seen my balls? They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up, just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em...
"
2,9,Cartman,"Aw, man, smells like ass down here.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 
"
2,9,Stan,"What was that? 
"
2,9,Cartman,"Aw, man, let's get out of here!
"
2,9,Kyle,"We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 
"
2,9,The boys,"Aaaaah!
"
2,9,Kenny,"(Wait!) 
"
2,9,Kyle,"What the hell? 
"
2,9,Stan,"Mr. Garrison?
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh uh- hello, children.
"
2,9,Cartman,"What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out.
"
2,9,Kyle,"In a sewer?
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"Children, do you know how to file a police report?
"
2,9,The boys,"No.
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"Good. See you in school. 
"
2,9,Cartman,"This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
"
2,9,Cartman,"Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home. 
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Hooowwwdy ho! 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey!
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Howdy-ho, boys.
"
2,9,Kyle,"I told you guys he'd be here!
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Hi, Mr. Hankey. Nice to see yuh.
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Have you all been brushing behind your teeth?
"
2,9,The boys,"Yes.
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"And usin' dental floss?
"
2,9,The boys,"Yes.
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"And washin' behind your ears?
"
2,9,The boys,"Yes.
"
2,9,Cartman,"No. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home.
"
2,9,Stan,"What do you mean?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Oh my God.
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment.
"
2,9,Kyle,"And that's why you got a cold?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"That's why, Kyle. That's why.
"
2,9,Stan,"Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Don't forget to change your sheets once a week! 
"
2,9,Host,"So without further ado we will begin this amazing film. It's a work of blood, sweat, and tears.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
"
2,9,Director 4,"Is that Leonardo DiCaprio? 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Aaahh!
"
2,9,Director 4,"Ohuh no, wait, that's not him. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
"
2,9,Female director,"Excuse me, little boy, what's a ""Mr. Hankey""?
"
2,9,Kyle,"He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 
"
2,9,Director 3,"What a great story-it has everything!
"
2,9,Female director,"This could be the next Free Willy.
"
2,9,Director 5,"Great pic, son. How much do you want for it?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Huh??
"
2,9,Director 6,"Does it-uh have to be a talking piece of poo? 
"
2,9,Director 7,"It could be a crime-fighting rabbit. Or a lovable turtle.
"
2,9,Director 4,"This could be a great summer movie.
"
2,9,Female director 2,"Can we put a mon-key in it?
"
2,9,Director 8,"""The Mr. Hankey Stor-"" uh is Harrison Ford available for a fall pic?
"
2,9,Director 9,"Keanu Reeves.
"
2,9,Director 10,"Matt Damon!
"
2,9,Fred Savage,"Fred Savage! 
"
2,9,Director 7,"I'd pay a million for this story!
"
2,9,Director 10,"I'll pay two. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Dude, no one even listened to me.
"
2,9,Stan,"Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
"
2,9,Director 3,"Mmuh I take it you're part owner of this whole Mr. Hooey story, right?
"
2,9,Cartman,"Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess.
"
2,9,Director 3,"I want you to do a big-money deal with me.
"
2,9,Cartman,"All of us?
"
2,9,Director 3,"Mm-we-hell, I can see that you're the real brains of the group. You don't really need those guys, do you?
"
2,9,Cartman,"Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.
"
2,9,Director 3,"Hm-that's great, kid. Let's make a deal. 
"
2,9,Robert,"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for making the First Annual South Park Film Festival a success. We've barely even started and already the festival has seen more attendance than last year's Sundance festival. 
"
2,9,Someone in the crowd,"Fantastic!
"
2,9,Robert,"And I'm very pleased to announce that in honor of the South Park people who have welcomed us, we are going to build a Hollywood Planet restaurant, right here where this library used to stand. 
"
2,9,Crowd,"Ooohhh!
"
2,9,Aide 2,"Can they do that?
"
2,9,Mayor,"They're Hollywood! They can do anything!
"
2,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho.  Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?
"
2,9,Kyle,"They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin' 
"
2,9,Kyle,"We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out.
"
2,9,Kyle,"It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"But I won't last long up above.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"All right, just let me get my toothbrush. 
"
2,9,Wendy,"Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening! 
"
2,9,Stan,"Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
"
2,9,Tom Hanks,"Mr. Hankey, I can't go on anymore. I've lost the fight.
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"No, I'm not leaving without you.  We started this together, we're gonna finish it together. 
"
2,9,Tom Hanks,"I always thought death was something glorious, but now I know that it's not. 
"
2,9,Director 3,"It's going over really well. People are gonna be knocking my door down to get you.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
"
2,9,Tom Hanks,"I'll always love you, Mr. Hankey.
"
2,9,Cartman,"I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy.
"
2,9,Man 1,"Oh my God, I found a penny! 
"
2,9,Man 2,"You bastard!
"
2,9,Kyle,"Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"It sure is -dry up here. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
"
2,9,Mayor,"Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?
"
2,9,Robert,"Make it quick.
"
2,9,Mayor,"Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town.
"
2,9,Robert,"Uh-huh.
"
2,9,Mayor,"Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?
"
2,9,Robert,"We have contracts.  You try to pull out now, we'll sue your little town for every penny it's got. But thanks so much for the hard work.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!
"
2,9,Marty,"Mmp right. Two million, minus your agent's fee, minus your lawyer's fee, minus my fee, and the publicity and taxes taken out, you get three dollars! That's more than most people in your position make, trust me!
"
2,9,Stan,"Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!
"
2,9,Cartman,"I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?
"
2,9,Stan,"If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
"
2,9,Chef,"It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!  I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it. 
"
2,9,Stan,"So what do we do now?
"
2,9,Chef,"There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.
"
2,9,Kyle,"You guys, we have to hurry!
"
2,9,Stan,"Why?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!
"
2,9,Robert,"Not now!
"
2,9,Kyle,"I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
"
2,9,A director,"What's this? 
"
2,9,Kyle,"I want you guys to all meet my friend. 
"
2,9,Robert,"That's great, kid. A dried-out lump of shit; very compelling.  Okay, folks, let's move! We've gotta have that sign down in time for the opening tonight!
"
2,9,Kyle,"You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.  Clo-ser.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"There is a-nother Sky-walk-er. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Nooohohohohohoho-
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Wake up.
"
2,9,Kyle,"What is it, Mr. Hankey?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Come clo-ser.
"
2,9,Kyle,"What is it?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Clo-ser.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Yes?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Closer!  One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Nooo! 
"
2,9,Voice over,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. He loved me, I loved you.Therefore vicariously he loved you-
"
2,9,Kyle,"Nooo!
"
2,9,HazMat official,"I'm sorry, son. Let's get him to ICU. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Noo! No!
"
2,9,Stan,"Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
"
2,9,Wendy,"Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? 
"
2,9,Stan,"Okay! 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Uuf.
"
2,9,Cowboy,"Say, Tom. Do you have any pudding left?
"
2,9,Tom,"I ate all mine up, silly.
"
2,9,Cowboy,"Well then, now what do we do? 
"
2,9,Man,"AAWWWW!
"
2,9,Wendy,"Eeewww!
"
2,9,Man,"Hey!
"
2,9,Stan,"Sorry.
"
2,9,Cowboy,"Well, why don't we just explore our sexuality?
"
2,9,Tom,"Ooh, good idea. Let's. 
"
2,9,Stan,"Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 
"
2,9,Man,"Aaww!  Is there a problem, young man?
"
2,9,Stan,"No problem, dude.
"
2,9,Kyle,"I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
"
2,9,Chef,"Come on, Kyle. It's time to go.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Chef, does poo go to heaven?
"
2,9,Chef,"Well, uh-I kinda hope not.  I mean, sure it does.  Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.  Come on, let's go. 
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Kyle.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey?
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Howdy-ho.
"
2,9,Kyle,"He's back! He's back! 
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"That was delicious.
"
2,9,Chef,"My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!
"
2,9,Kyle,"You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
"
2,9,Chef,"You're daaamn right.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95! 
"
2,9,Woman,"I'll take two.
"
2,9,Man,"I'd like to pay for one.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
"
2,9,Robert,"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce on this Gala Opening of Hollywood Planet South Park, that the festival will be back next year!  And the year after that, and the year after that, and so on! And now, release the curtain!  I give you, ""Hollywood in South Park!"" 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 
"
2,9,Robert,"Oh, not this again!
"
2,9,Kyle,"Behold! Mr. Hankey! 
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Hoooooowwwdy-ho! 
"
2,9,Robert,"Anyway, this new Hollywood Planet will be the official meeting place for all-
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival.
"
2,9,Short Man,"Mr. Poo, if you wouldn't mind, we can't hear our chairman. If you could just turn yourself down. You're at about 7 right now, we need you at about, 3, okay? 
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A good film festival should be something where we all say, ""Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget all those things for just a while, and just watch some new art."" 
"
2,9,Robert,"I have had enough of you! 
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Nyyaarrrr!
"
2,9,Kyle,"No! 
"
2,9,Robert,"Now, as I was saying, this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead. 
"
2,9,Chef,"Well, it worked once before. 
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Hi, Chef. Your big chocolate balls are just the trick! 
"
2,9,Stan,"What the hell is he doing?
"
2,9,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Whoa!
"
2,9,An Agent,"Oh my God!
"
2,9,Crowd Members,"Aaaaahh!
"
2,9,Man,"Oh, my God, it's crap!
"
2,9,Man 2,"Ohh! Noo! 
"
2,9,Man 3,"Whoa, it smells, it smells! 
"
2,9,Phyllis,"Come on, let's go! It's coming!
"
2,9,Robert,"I'm trying, damn it!
"
2,9,Robert,"Aww. Aww. Glup. 
"
2,9,Man,"Let's get out of this town!
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
"
2,9,Townsfolk,"Hooray!
"
2,9,Mayor,"Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!
"
2,9,Mr. Hankey,"I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle.  Kisses. 
"
2,9,Wendy,"Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films.
"
2,9,Stan,"Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.
"
2,9,Wendy,"Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Yes. And I've learned something, too.  Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.
"
2,10,Sharon,"But what's wrong with her?
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?
"
2,10,Sharon,"No, no, she's been perfectly healthy.
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease. 
"
2,10,Sharon,"Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.
"
2,10,Shelly,"Oh, whoo-peee!
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes.
"
2,10,Stan,"Dude, you've got herpes on your face!
"
2,10,Shelly,"Shut up, brat!
"
2,10,Sharon,"Will my daughter be okay?
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"She'll be fine.
"
2,10,Shelly,"Stop it!
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.
"
2,10,Stan,"Ow! 
"
2,10,Sharon,"Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.
"
2,10,Sharon,"...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die.
"
2,10,Sheila,"My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.
"
2,10,Liane,"I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
"
2,10,Sharon,"So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young.
"
2,10,Sheila,"That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.
"
2,10,Liane,"Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.
"
2,10,Sharon,"So it's not such a crazy idea after all?
"
2,10,Sheila,"Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now. 
"
2,10,Kyle,"Are you guys having a meeting or something?
"
2,10,Sheila,"How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
"
2,10,Cartman,"No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
"
2,10,Sharon,"Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Oh weak!
"
2,10,Kyle,"I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
"
2,10,Stan,"Yeah, it's pretty weird. 
"
2,10,Kyle,"Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
"
2,10,Cartman,"In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn 
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto
"
2,10,Stuart,"Yeah?
"
2,10,Stan,"We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
"
2,10,Stuart,"What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--?
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young.
"
2,10,Stuart,"Oh yeah.
"
2,10,Stan,"Catch what?
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner. 
"
2,10,Cartman,"And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto
"
2,10,Stan,"Sshh! Cartman!
"
2,10,Cartman,"What?
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!
"
2,10,Kenny,"(No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!
"
2,10,Kyle,"Heheheh, buns.
"
2,10,Kenny,"(Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)
"
2,10,Stan,"Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
"
2,10,Cartman,"Where is the Nintendo?
"
2,10,Stuart,"We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV. 
"
2,10,Kyle,"Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Oh, good. I'm starving.
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Let's say grace. 
"
2,10,Stuart,"Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen.
"
2,10,All,"Amen.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Pfff..!
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Okay, let's dig in. 
"
2,10,Kevin,"That one's mine, that one's mine!
"
2,10,Cartman,"What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?  Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?
"
2,10,Stuart,"So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?
"
2,10,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Stuart, don't even get started! 
"
2,10,Stuart,"What? I'm just askin' a question.  You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!
"
2,10,Cartman,"Puh! I heard that.
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"That ain't why, Stuart!  It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night! 
"
2,10,Stuart,"Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!
"
2,10,Stuart,"You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.
"
2,10,Kevin,"My waffle's d-hun, my waffle's d-hu-hun!
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?
"
2,10,Stuart,"Hey! We don't say ""fuck"" at the table, you little asshole!
"
2,10,Cartman,"Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.
"
2,10,Kenny,"(Aa-choo!)
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them.
"
2,10,Stan,"Huh?
"
2,10,Kenny,"(Waa-choo!)
"
2,10,Cartman,"Ey! 
"
2,10,Cartman,"Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell is that?
"
2,10,Cartman,"It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
"
2,10,Kyle,"No, it's not cool!
"
2,10,Stan,"Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
"
2,10,Cartman,"Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!
"
2,10,Kenny,"(Uh-huh.)
"
2,10,Cartman,"Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.
"
2,10,Stan,"I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
"
2,10,Kenny,"(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)
"
2,10,Stan,"Oh. 
"
2,10,Kenny,"(Aa-choo!)
"
2,10,Sharon,"Okay, lemme see.  Oh, goody! You've got a fever!
"
2,10,Stan,"Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?!
"
2,10,Sharon,"Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright.
"
2,10,Stan,"Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
"
2,10,Sharon,"Oh, gee, I guess you did.
"
2,10,Stan,"Well, you sure seem happy about it!
"
2,10,Sharon,"All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.
"
2,10,Liane,"Don't scratch it, hon.
"
2,10,Cartman,"But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!
"
2,10,Liane,"No, hon.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!
"
2,10,Liane,"Here, I got you some calamine lotion. 
"
2,10,Cartman,"I don't wanna.
"
2,10,Liane,"It'll make your itches go away. 
"
2,10,Cartman,"Ugh. Uunnh.  Ey, give me that!  Ahhhh...
"
2,10,Liane,"Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.
"
2,10,Cartman,"More calamine lotion!
"
2,10,Sheila,"I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Yeah. I feel great!
"
2,10,Sheila,"Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
"
2,10,Sheila,"Did you sleep in the same room?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Yes. Why?
"
2,10,Sheila,"Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?
"
2,10,Kyle,"No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
"
2,10,Sheila,"Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
"
2,10,Sheila,"I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
"
2,10,Gerald,"Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
"
2,10,Gerald,"Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.
"
2,10,Kyle,"But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
"
2,10,Gerald,"Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.  You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Gods and clods?
"
2,10,Gerald,"Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!
"
2,10,Gerald,"That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America.
"
2,10,Sharon,"Stanley, can I get you anything else?  Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!
"
2,10,Sharon,"Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay.
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"Can I talk to you outside?
"
2,10,Sharon,"Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?
"
2,10,Stan,"Okay.
"
2,10,Shelly,"Serves you right, you little brat!
"
2,10,Stan,"Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
2,10,Shelly,"If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!
"
2,10,TV Voice,"Will Carol find out she's a fa...
"
2,10,Stan,"I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
"
2,10,Shelly,"We're watching this!
"
2,10,Stan,"Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. 
"
2,10,Phillip,"Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities? 
"
2,10,Terrance,"Sure thing, Phillip.  Ah ha ha ha, you got me again! 
"
2,10,Phillip,"That's tomfoolery. 
"
2,10,Shelly,"Give me the remote!
"
2,10,Stan,"No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here! 
"
2,10,TV Voice,"She was...
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while.
"
2,10,Sharon,"Oh God, what have we done?
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"There there now, it's not your fault.
"
2,10,Randy,"Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Could we go home now, Ma?
"
2,10,Sheila,"No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.
"
2,10,Kyle,"But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
"
2,10,Sheila,"I've got a great game for you. It's called ""ookie mouth"".
"
2,10,Kyle,"What's ""ookie mouth""?
"
2,10,Sheila,"First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say ""ookie mouth"" at the same time.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Sick, dude!
"
2,10,Sheila,"No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.  That ought to take care of it.
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"You want some more hot water?
"
2,10,Sheila,"Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Naw, we don't go for that hoidy-toidy rich folk stuff.
"
2,10,Sheila,"I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!
"
2,10,Sheila,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
"
2,10,Sheila,"Try again, bubbe!
"
2,10,Kyle,"Argh!
"
2,10,Sheila,"You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.
"
2,10,Sheila,"Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself.
"
2,10,Sheila,"Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd.
"
2,10,Sheila,"But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
"
2,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Uh-I don't know.
"
2,10,Sheila,"We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
"
2,10,Kyle,"I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 
"
2,10,Sheila,"Practice makes perfect, bubbe.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!
"
2,10,Terrance,"Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news.
"
2,10,Phillip,"Give it to me straight, Terrance.
"
2,10,Terrance,"The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.
"
2,10,Phillip,"Oh, what a relief!
"
2,10,Terrance,"The bad news is, you have cancer. 
"
2,10,Phillip,"Cancer?
"
2,10,Terrance,"Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.
"
2,10,Phillip,"My ass is collapsing?
"
2,10,Terrance,"Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass. See this line?  That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.
"
2,10,Phillip,"Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
"
2,10,Terrance,"No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore. 
"
2,10,Cartman,"Oh, no.  Damnit!  No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!  Uh. Yes. Uh...
"
2,10,Liane,"I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion. 
"
2,10,Cartman,"It's about friggin' time! Give me that! 
"
2,10,Liane,"Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Uugh!  Yeessss.  Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh... 
"
2,10,Stuart,"I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry.
"
2,10,Gerald,"Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...
"
2,10,Stuart,"Tackle box?
"
2,10,Gerald,"Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?
"
2,10,Stuart,"When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless.
"
2,10,Gerald,"Right. Right-right.
"
2,10,Mr. Garrison,"And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?  Yes, Kyle?
"
2,10,Kyle,"What the hell does that have to do with American history?
"
2,10,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
"
2,10,Mr. Garrison,"Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, ""How I would make America better.""
"
2,10,Kyle,"What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
"
2,10,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too.
"
2,10,Stan,"Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
"
2,10,Sharon,"Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.
"
2,10,Stan,"That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
"
2,10,Sharon,"Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good.
"
2,10,Stan,"Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
"
2,10,Randy,"Yeah, it's-it's true, he is.
"
2,10,Sharon,"Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper.
"
2,10,Stan,"Wait! Where are you going?
"
2,10,Randy,"We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
"
2,10,Stan,"Milkshakes?!
"
2,10,Sharon,"Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.
"
2,10,Randy,"See ya, son. 
"
2,10,Stan,"Weak!
"
2,10,Kyle,"""So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea.""
"
2,10,Sheila,"No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.  He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
"
2,10,Kyle,"What?
"
2,10,Sheila,"I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
2,10,Sheila,"Kyle, what are you doing there, honey?
"
2,10,Kyle,"You!
"
2,10,Sheila,"I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz. 
"
2,10,Kyle,"You!
"
2,10,Sheila,"What, bubbeleh, what is it?
"
2,10,Kyle,"You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
"
2,10,Sheila,"Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
"
2,10,Sheila,"Now, Kyle, come here.
"
2,10,Kyle,"You get away from me, you crazy woman! 
"
2,10,Sheila,"Hoh boy.
"
2,10,Stuart,"Beer?
"
2,10,Gerald,"Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.  Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?
"
2,10,Stuart,"Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.
"
2,10,Gerald,"Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
"
2,10,Stuart,"That's where I live now.
"
2,10,Gerald,"Oh, right.
"
2,10,Stan,"And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Stan! Stan!
"
2,10,Stan,"Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?
"
2,10,Stan,"Yeah.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
"
2,10,Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
2,10,Kyle,"They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
"
2,10,Stan,"They did?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
"
2,10,Stan,"Why?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Because they're a bunch of assholes.
"
2,10,Stan,"Of course!
"
2,10,Kyle,"Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
"
2,10,Cartman,"""I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool.""  Mom, answer that! ""They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."" 
"
2,10,Kyle,"Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
"
2,10,Cartman,"I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
"
2,10,Stan,"Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
"
2,10,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
"
2,10,Cartman,"She what?!
"
2,10,Stan,"It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
"
2,10,Cartman,"That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
"
2,10,Kyle,"No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
"
2,10,Gerald,"Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.
"
2,10,Stuart,"Not that easy. You were lucky.
"
2,10,Gerald,"Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky.
"
2,10,Stuart,"You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
"
2,10,Gerald,"Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody!
"
2,10,Stuart,"I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!
"
2,10,Gerald,"You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!  Ow!! 
"
2,10,Stuart,"Now don't make me do that again! 
"
2,10,Gerald,"Ow! You son of a bitch! 
"
2,10,Stuart,"Uh!
"
2,10,Gerald,"Ow!
"
2,10,Stuart,"Oh!
"
2,10,Gerald,"Ow! 
"
2,10,Stuart,"Eeaagghh! 
"
2,10,Gerald,"Huuuh!
"
2,10,Randy,"Doctor?
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"Yes?
"
2,10,Randy,"Wh-where's Stan?
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"Stan?
"
2,10,Randy,"Stan, our son?
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"Oh, yes. Where is Stan?
"
2,10,Sharon,"You mean Stanley's missing?
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment.
"
2,10,Sharon,"Oh my God! Our son ran away!
"
2,10,Randy,"Will he be okay out of the hospital?
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"Oh sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die.
"
2,10,Sharon,"Die?
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs.
"
2,10,Randy,"Okay, well well, let's go look--
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny.
"
2,10,Sharon,"Oh God, no!
"
2,10,Randy,"I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--
"
2,10,Sheila,"So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
"
2,10,Gerald,"That son of a bitch ripped my parka! 
"
2,10,Sheila,"Catch anything?
"
2,10,Gerald,"I just don't get it.  Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
"
2,10,Sheila,"Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.
"
2,10,Gerald,"What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
"
2,10,Sheila,"I thought it would be good for you.
"
2,10,Gerald,"Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
"
2,10,Sheila,"I'm doing the best I can!
"
2,10,Gerald,"What?!
"
2,10,Gerald,"Oh, God, what have I done?
"
2,10,Phillip,"What's happening here, Terrance?
"
2,10,Terrance,"We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
"
2,10,Phillip,"Who's the donor?
"
2,10,Terrance,"I am, Phillip. I am.
"
2,10,Phillip,"Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?
"
2,10,Terrance,"Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass.
"
2,10,Chef,"Oh, damn it, not now!  Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!
"
2,10,Kyle,"Chef, we wanna know about herpes.
"
2,10,Chef,"What makes you think I would know anything about that?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
"
2,10,Stan,"How does someone get herpes?
"
2,10,Chef,"Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Do you know anybody with herpes?
"
2,10,Chef,"Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her.
"
2,10,Stan,"But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
"
2,10,Chef,"Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Cool! Thanks, Chef!
"
2,10,Chef,"O-kay!  Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
"
2,10,Sharon,"Stanley?
"
2,10,Randy,"Stan?
"
2,10,Sharon,"Oh, Stanley, where are you..?
"
2,10,Randy,"Stan?
"
2,10,Sharon,"Stanley! 
"
2,10,Kyle,"Are you old Frida?
"
2,10,Frida,"Who wants to know?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Someone who wants a favor.
"
2,10,Frida,"Ten dollars a lay, five dollars a b-- 
"
2,10,Kyle,"Huh?
"
2,10,Cartman,"We want you to give our parents herpes.
"
2,10,Frida,"Five dollars.
"
2,10,Stan,"My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
"
2,10,Kyle,"Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
"
2,10,Stan,"And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
"
2,10,Stan,"Thanks a lot, Frida!
"
2,10,Frida,"Don't mention it. 
"
2,10,Kyle,"D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
"
2,10,Boys,"Hooray! 
"
2,10,Randy,"Stanley, where the hell have you been?
"
2,10,Sharon,"Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!
"
2,10,Stan,"I don't wanna go back there.
"
2,10,Randy,"Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital. 
"
2,10,Stan,"Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
"
2,10,Randy,"What?
"
2,10,Stan,"You know, freshen up your breath.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Aw, man.  I don't feel so good.
"
2,10,Sheila,"Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--
"
2,10,Kyle,"Ugh... 
"
2,10,Sheila,"Kyle!!
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all.
"
2,10,Kyle,"We're sorry.
"
2,10,Dr. Doctor,"Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in.
"
2,10,Kyle,"This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Hell no, you guys get your own!
"
2,10,Sharon,"Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?
"
2,10,Stan,"Pretty good.
"
2,10,Sharon,"The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.
"
2,10,Randy,"Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?
"
2,10,Stan,"Wow, coo-hul!
"
2,10,Sheila,"And how are you, Kyle?
"
2,10,Gerald,"Are you doing okay?
"
2,10,Kyle,"I'm better now. 
"
2,10,Sharon,"What's so funny, you two?
"
2,10,Kyle,"We gave you guys herpes.
"
2,10,Sheila,"What-what-whaaat?! You did this?!
"
2,10,Stan,"We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
"
2,10,Randy,"I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
"
2,10,Sharon,"Well, I guess it serves us right.  Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox.
"
2,10,Sheila,"It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it. 
"
2,10,Cartman,"Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?
"
2,10,Liane,"Ooh, I have them somewhere else, boopiekins.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Hooray!
"
2,10,Gerald,"And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.
"
2,10,Stuart,"Aww hell, I'm sorry, too. 
"
2,10,Terrance,"Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better. 
"
2,10,Cartman,"Well, I know one thing for sure.
"
2,10,Liane,"What's that, Eric?
"
2,10,Cartman,"We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
"
2,10,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
2,10,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
2,11,Police Commissioner,"Well, detective. It looks like ya fooled them again.
"
2,11,Barnaby Jones,"All in a day's work, I guess. I just hope that next time, I won't have to run so much. 
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, ""This is not a victimless crime""? Anybody?  Children, were you paying attention?!
"
2,11,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?
"
2,11,Stan,"Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, and what do you consider normal?!
"
2,11,Stan,"I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
"
2,11,The Class,"Yeah!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow!
"
2,11,The Class,"Hooray!
"
2,11,Kyle,"To where?
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"To the planetarium.
"
2,11,The Class,"AAWWWW!
"
2,11,Cartman,"Planetariums suck!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh now, what's wrong with the planetarium?
"
2,11,Stan,"It's boring.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Yeah, all the constellations look alike.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well, too bad! You're all going to the planetarium tomorrow and you're all going to love it! In the meantime, we're going to watch episode #203, Barnaby Under Siege.
"
2,11,The Class,"Aawwww.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials. 
"
2,11,Announcer,"Hey kids, do you love Cheesy Poofs? 
"
2,11,The Class,"Yes.
"
2,11,Announcer,"Well, Cheesy Poofs is looking for a kid to sing the happy Cheesy Poofs song. Watch for our talent van as it goes around the country.
"
2,11,Cartman,"I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
"
2,11,Announcer,"If you win, you could be picked to be in our next Cheesy Poofs commercial. So remember,
I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road.
"
2,11,Ms. Crabtree,"THAT AIN'T HOW YOY DO IT! YOU DO IT LIKE THIS: SIDDOWN AND SHUT UP!! 
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Ow! Jesus, lady!
"
2,11,Ms. Crabtree,"THIS IS THE PLANETARIUM, WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE WAY DOWN SO AS NOT TO HURT YOURSEELF!
"
2,11,Kid,"Ow.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves.
"
2,11,Announcer,"Does your child have what it takes to be the next Cheesy Poofs anthem singer? 
"
2,11,Cartman,"Hey, there it is!
"
2,11,Announcer,"We're going around the country to find the kid who can sing the Cheesy Poofs song better than anybody.
"
2,11,Cartman,"I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behnd my back!
"
2,11,Kyle,"You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.
"
2,11,Cartman,"But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on! 
"
2,11,Cartman,"But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!
"
2,11,A Boy,"Wow, don't you...?
"
2,11,A Girl,"What is that?
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium.
"
2,11,Kyle,"I thought it was ""plane-tarium.""
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Well, it is. But I have a bone disease which impedes my ability to pronounce the ""t"" in ""plane'arium""
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"That's a pretty weird bone disease.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.  Yes, little boy?
"
2,11,Cartman,"How long is that Chessy Poofs van gonna be outside?
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works.
"
2,11,Cartman,"As if we care.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Hey, who are you?
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us.
"
2,11,Missy,"I love my work.
"
2,11,Stan,"Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
"
2,11,Missy,"I love my work. 
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we?
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable. 
"
2,11,Stan,"This is stupid.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... ehcome out. 
"
2,11,Kyle,"Whoopie.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Here we see the constellation called, ""The Big Dipper"". If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it,  a-hah , we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull , while these stars form the constellation, ""Roger Ebert"" . And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades . Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of...
"
2,11,Cartman,"Aw man, screw this. 
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"And now breathe deep as the stars sloowwly start to move in little circles.  I know you think plane'ariums are boring, but I'm gonna try to change the way you think about that.
"
2,11,Boy,"...you love Cheesy Poofs If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame
"
2,11,Announcer,"That was great, Tommy. Tommy Fritz from Torrey Pines! He could be our winner.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!
"
2,11,Announcer,"Oh, and what's your name, little boy?
"
2,11,Cartman,"Eric Cartman.
"
2,11,Announcer,"Alright, here's Eric Cartman giving it a shot. 
"
2,11,Tommy,"Aaah! 
"
2,11,Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!
"
2,11,Announcer,"Wow!
"
2,11,Cartman,"Thaat's right, suck on that. 
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?
"
2,11,Kyle,"Oh, man, I don't feel so good.
"
2,11,Stan,"Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Me too. It was sweet.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Really? What did you like best about it?
"
2,11,Stan,"I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Wait a minute. Where is Eric?
"
2,11,Cartman,"I did it! I did it!
"
2,11,Kyle,"Did what?
"
2,11,Cartman,"I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
"
2,11,Cartman,"Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Goodbye, children. Thanks for visiting. Don't forget: we have Laser Rock shows at night here at the plane-'arium. This week it's Laser Kenny Loggins and Laser James Taylor.
"
2,11,Kyle,"My head still feels funny.
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah, mine too.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Like you really need it, hippo-ass!
"
2,11,Cartman,"It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is.
"
2,11,Boy,"Waaaah!
"
2,11,"Stan, Kyle","AAAAAH!
"
2,11,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!
"
2,11,Boy,"My... name... is... vvan... G-gelder.
"
2,11,Stan,"Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Nnno! Nn-don't go back! Nnno!
"
2,11,Cartman,"Hey, be careful, asshole!
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Eegh! Don't take me back there!  I can't... can't...
"
2,11,Stan,"Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Aaaagghh. 
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Aagh! The planetarium! Haah!
"
2,11,Nurse Gollum,"I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down.
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Nno! Nnno pain killer! I'll be okay!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Okay uh van Gelder-
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Nnnaaaah!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"-okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay?
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Eh must... tell... the machine. The machine is... e-e-e-ghe gheh- 
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal?
"
2,11,Principal Victoria,"Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium.
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Haah! Planetarium!
"
2,11,Principal Victoria,"I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Nnaaah!
"
2,11,Principal Victoria,"Oh, man, this is boring!
"
2,11,Man,"Yeah, who the heck finds this stuff interesting? 
"
2,11,Teen 1,"Dude, this is totally killer.
"
2,11,Teen 2,"I hope this goes on for like, seven months, man.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"You will not remember what happened here. To remember it will cause incredible pain.  Incredible pain!  Incredible icky paaiin!
"
2,11,Teen 1,"Dude, I'm totally tripping.
"
2,11,Teen 2,"This is totally killer.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?
"
2,11,Stan,"That's a haiku?
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school.
"
2,11,Stan,"Oh.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Was he on the school bus this morning?
"
2,11,Stan,"No.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?
"
2,11,Kenny,"(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah. What's a discharge?
"
2,11,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
"
2,11,Kyle,"I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams. 
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, where have you been?
"
2,11,Cartman,"Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?
"
2,11,Stan,"Where have you been, Cartman?
"
2,11,Cartman,"Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship! 
"
2,11,The Class,"Whoa!
"
2,11,Cartman,"This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it?  Hey, where is your regional champsionship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?  Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?  Apparently, only I do.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion.
"
2,11,Stan,"Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
"
2,11,Cartman,"It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
"
2,11,Kyle,"I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Very good, Kyle.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it! 
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Um. How's he doing, nurse?
"
2,11,Nurse Gollum,"He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now.
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Nno! No drugs.
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Drugs are good, mkay?
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Nno! Don't let them g-go... planetarium!
"
2,11,Nurse Gollum,"But why, van Gelder?
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"The machine. The machine is aaaah. 
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.
"
2,11,Nurse Gollum,"He's been talking about ""the machine"" for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes.
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Wha- why in America's Funniest Home Videos? Why?
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay?
"
2,11,Nurse Gollum,"A what?
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope.
"
2,11,Nurse Gollum,"Well, what will you need?
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time.  Mkay?
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children?
"
2,11,The Class,"Yes. 
"
2,11,Teen 1,"This way, please.
"
2,11,Teen 2,"Enjoy your visit. 
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Certainly, Mr. Garrison.  You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab-  and right over here we see the constellation Orion.  Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsar...
"
2,11,Stan,"Dude, what just happened?
"
2,11,Kyle,"What do you mean?
"
2,11,Stan,"Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
"
2,11,Liane,"Don't pick your nose, hon.
"
2,11,Cartman,"I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!
"
2,11,Liane,"Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.
"
2,11,Cartman,"I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
"
2,11,Poor Girl,"Do you think I might win, Mommy?
"
2,11,Poor Mom,"I hope so, honey. Then perhaps we can eat for a little while.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!
"
2,11,Poor Girl,"Did you hear that, Mommy?
"
2,11,Poor Mom,"Come on! Perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs! 
"
2,11,Cartman,"Psych!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there.
"
2,11,Stan,"Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
"
2,11,Kyle,"Sshh!
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming.
"
2,11,Clyde,"I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volunteer work here.
"
2,11,Clyde,"Yes. Yes, please!
"
2,11,Butters,"Me, too!
"
2,11,Annie,"Me, too! I wanna do it! I'd love to work here.
"
2,11,A Girl,"I'd like to tape the show!
"
2,11,Fosse,"Yeah, me tohohoo. Plahanehetaharium's gahahay! 
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Mr. Garrison?
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Excellent! Why don't we step over here and I'll show all you children how to volunteer.
"
2,11,The Class,"Hooray! 
"
2,11,Stan,"Dude, this isn't right.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Why?
"
2,11,Stan,"We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Oh, yeah.
"
2,11,Stan,"Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. 
"
2,11,Kyle,"Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
"
2,11,Stan,"Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
"
2,11,Kenny,"(Okay. Got to have some huggin'.) 
"
2,11,Stan,"He hits this switch- 
"
2,11,Kenny,"(I don't see anything.)
"
2,11,Kyle,"You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah, I guess so. 
"
2,11,Kenny,"(Whoa, dude.)
"
2,11,Kyle,"What does that do?
"
2,11,Stan,"I don't know. 
"
2,11,Kyle,"Kenny! What's it doing? 
"
2,11,Stan,"This says ""maximum.""  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
"
2,11,Kyle,"We're bastards!
"
2,11,Stan,"Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 
"
2,11,Kyle,"We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!
"
2,11,Boy,"(clap clap clap)

"
2,11,Center Judge,"Thank you... uh, Peter. We'll let you know very soon.  Next will be uuh, Eric Theodore Cartman.
"
2,11,Liane,"Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.
"
2,11,Cartman,"I know, I know! 
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right
"
2,11,Center Judge,"Well, Heric Cartman, that certainly was... insane.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Thank you.
"
2,11,Center Judge,"We'll let you know.
"
2,11,Liane,"Thank you.  Don't pick your nose, hon.
"
2,11,Cartman,"I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch! 
"
2,11,Center Judge,"Jesus, where do we find these people?!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay?
"
2,11,Nurse Gollum,"This is the strangest thing I've ever seen!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded.  Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.
"
2,11,Van Gelder,"Dr. Adams.
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Yes.
"
2,11,Nurse Gollum,"He owns the planetarium. What about him?
"
2,11,"Van Gelder, Mr. Mackey","He uses the machine. The star machine.
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Mkay?
"
2,11,"Van Gelder, Mr. Mackey","He uses it to erase minds.
"
2,11,Nurse Gollum,"But why?
"
2,11,"Van Gelder, Mr. Mackey","Planetarium, about to go out of business. Adams had to create slaves to survive.
"
2,11,Nurse Gollum,"My God! This is amazing!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay?
"
2,11,Center Judge,"Well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. Only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is Eric Cartman.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Yes! I'm the best!
"
2,11,Center Judge,"You were actually our last choice. Uh the other children have unexpectedly taken jobs as volunteers at the planetarium.
"
2,11,Blonde Judge,"That's odd.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Sweeet!
"
2,11,Tom,"It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban.
"
2,11,Asian Reporter,"Thanks, Tom. Yes, indeed, the planetarium has become very popular as word spreads that it really isn't as lame and stupid as one suspected. I'm here with the planetarium operator, Dr. Adams.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium
"
2,11,Asian Reporter,"So, bring the whole family to the plane-tarium for a night of excitement and wonder.
"
2,11,Stan,"...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys.
"
2,11,Kyle,"But it's true, dude!
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah, pretty sure.
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong.
"
2,11,Stan,"What other crime in South Park?
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, yeah. Let's go.
"
2,11,Director,"Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent?
"
2,11,Cartman,"I'm over here. 
"
2,11,Liane,"Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Aay!  Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
"
2,11,Director,"Okay, roll camera, aaand action.
"
2,11,Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you-
"
2,11,Liane,"Oh wait, wait.  You've got a little eye booger, hon.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake! 
"
2,11,Liane,"Got it. 
"
2,11,Director,"Aaand action.
"
2,11,Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs-
"
2,11,Director,"Hold it! Cut! Could we get some more light on that backdrop?
"
2,11,Stagehand,"Sure thing. 
"
2,11,Cartman,"Oh, man, c'mon!
"
2,11,Stagehand,"Got it.
"
2,11,Director,"Okay. Here we go, aaand action.
"
2,11,Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-
"
2,11,Director,"Cut!
"
2,11,Cartman,"What?!
"
2,11,Director,"I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes?
"
2,11,Cartman,"Oh, God damnit!
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Oh. Hello, officer of the law.
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"What brings you out here?
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town. 
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Oh, really? 
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of. 
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time.
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Okay, I'll be quick, then.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Of course, officer. Come on in.
"
2,11,Chef,"Hello, children.
"
2,11,Stan,"Oh, no! They got Chef, too!
"
2,11,Chef,"Welcome to the planetarium. 
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef.
"
2,11,Chef,"I love my work.
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Would you like to see the stars, officer?
"
2,11,"Stan, Kyle","No!
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"That would be super-duper! 
"
2,11,Kyle,"Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!
"
2,11,An Aged Voice,"Hello?
"
2,11,Cartman,"Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric.
"
2,11,Grandma,"Oh, hello, Eric. Grandma sure has missed you.
"
2,11,Cartman,"I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.
"
2,11,Grandma,"Oh, I will, Eric. You know, I remember when I was a little girl and had my first talent show audition for-
"
2,11,Cartman,"Okay, bye. 
"
2,11,The Marshes' Answering Machine,"Hello? The-uh Marshes aren't in right now. Please leave a message.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch. 
"
2,11,The Broflovskis' Answering Machine,"Hello, you've reached the Broflovskis. Please, leave a message.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"And this is the constellation called Cassiopeia.
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, neato!
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"And now, officer, from this moment on, you will think that you are Elvis Presley.
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Who?
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"To not be Elvis will cause you great pain.
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Pain.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me.
"
2,11,Kyle,"He's not highly intelligent.
"
2,11,Stan,"Why are you doing this, dude?
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Why? Because nowadays kids have computers, surround-sound television. They've forgotten all about plane'ariums. But I'll make them remember, starting with the two of you!
"
2,11,Voice-over,"Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these announcements.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Oh, dude, here it comes!
"
2,11,Cheesy Poofs Commercial,"Packed full of ingredients, Cheesy Poofs can really give you that quick pick-me-up. So remember, 
I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be-
"
2,11,Cheesy Poof Cartman,"Lame.
"
2,11,Voice-over,"And now back to Terrance and Phillip.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Aha! Caught you red-handed! Mkay!
"
2,11,Stan,"Mr. Mackey!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Officer Barbrady, uh, this man is using some kind of mind control.
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?
"
2,11,Nurse Gollum,"What's wrong with him?
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babeuhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston.
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"No, you idiot! He thinks he's Elvis.  Elvis, escort our guests to the plane'arium.
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Holdjit  If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Uh oh.
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Odle-oh who whoo?
"
2,11,Dr Adams,"Well, let's begin, shall we?  And now you'll remember nothing, except that the planet'arium is the best thing you've ever known! 
"
2,11,Cartman,"Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!  Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!  You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!  Planetariums suck ass! 
"
2,11,Dr. Adams,"Aaah. Aaah. Aaah.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Cartman! You saved us! 
"
2,11,Cartman,"What the hell are you talking about?
"
2,11,Stan,"Get over here and untie us! 
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, you really saved the day. Mkay?
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business. 
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay?
"
2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor.
"
2,11,Stan,"Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
"
2,11,Kyle,"He got a full dose of the stars.
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero. 
"
2,11,Liane,"Don't pick your nose, hon.
"
2,11,Cartman,"God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!
"
2,12,Stan,"Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
"
2,12,Cartman,"What is this? Halt!  It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
"
2,12,Stan,"Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!
"
2,12,Kyle,"Yeah! You're dead!
"
2,12,Cartman,"I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--
"
2,12,Stan,"No, you don't!
"
2,12,Cartman,"--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
"
2,12,Stan,"Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! 
"
2,12,Cartman,"That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!  What?
"
2,12,Kyle,"Well? Now what are we going to do?
"
2,12,Stan,"Huh-I dunno.
"
2,12,Wendy,"Hi, Stan.
"
2,12,Stan,"Hi, Wendy.
"
2,12,Wendy,"Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today? 
"
2,12,Kyle,"I dunno.
"
2,12,Wendy,"She does. She looks very pretty.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Okay.
"
2,12,Wendy,"Stan, can I talk to you for a second?  Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?
"
2,12,Stan,"...No.
"
2,12,Wendy,"If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace.
"
2,12,Stan,"We could?
"
2,12,Wendy,"Yeah, Stan.
"
2,12,Stan,"But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.
"
2,12,Wendy,"You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
"
2,12,Stan,"Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
"
2,12,Cartman,"Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk! 
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Heellp!!)
"
2,12,Wendy,"Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!
"
2,12,Stan,"Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
"
2,12,Kyle,"We do?
"
2,12,Stan,"We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 
"
2,12,Bebe,"Did it work?
"
2,12,Wendy,"I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend.
"
2,12,Bebe,"I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
"
2,12,Terrance,"Hey, Phillip, pull my finger.
"
2,12,Phillip,"All right, Terrance. 
"
2,12,Terrance,"Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder.
"
2,12,Phillip,"Well, all right. 
"
2,12,Terrance,"Hurgh, urgh.  Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip!
"
2,12,Phillip,"Okay.
"
2,12,Terrance,"Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!  Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-  Caught you there!
"
2,12,Randy,"Uh oh! 
"
2,12,Phillip,"God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!
"
2,12,Terrance,"Yes, I sure did! 
"
2,12,Kyle,"Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
"
2,12,Randy,"No, I was just uh flipping through the channels. 
"
2,12,Stan,"Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
"
2,12,Randy,"Okay.
"
2,12,Stan,"How do we do it?
"
2,12,Randy,"Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?
"
2,12,Stan,"Yeah, dude! How'd you know? 
"
2,12,Randy,"How do you think I met your mother?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!
"
2,12,Randy,"Oh, brother. 
"
2,12,Sharon,"Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!
"
2,12,Randy,"Yeah, Stanley, you should know better.
"
2,12,Stan,"Dude! 
"
2,12,Sharon,"Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot.
"
2,12,Sharon,"Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?
"
2,12,Randy,"Okay, okay. 
"
2,12,Fat Abbot,"Hey hey hey. What's goin' on, Rudy?
"
2,12,Rudy,"Man, Fat Abbot, you need to lose weight!
"
2,12,Fat Abbot,"I'll lose weight when I feel like it, bitch! Shut yo bitchass mouth, ho!
"
2,12,Rudy,"Bitch, I'll kick yo ass!
"
2,12,Kyle,"Whoa, dude!
"
2,12,Stan,"Sweet!
"
2,12,Fat Abbot,"You think you're slick, you punkass blasphemous dope-fiend bitch! I had my jimmy whacked seven times last week! I'll bust a cap in yo nigga ass, shithole!
"
2,12,Kyle,"Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!
"
2,12,Sharon,"Did you find it?
"
2,12,Randy,"Give me a second, would you?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Don't snap at me!
"
2,12,Randy,"I didn't snap at you.
"
2,12,Sharon,"You snapped at me!
"
2,12,Randy,"Whatever.
"
2,12,Sharon,"What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, ""whatever,"" to me!
"
2,12,Randy,"I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry.
"
2,12,Sharon,"I'm sorry, too.
"
2,12,Randy,"Uh I think I found it. 
"
2,12,Sharon,"That's not it, you idiot!
"
2,12,Randy,"Hey, back off, cunt!
"
2,12,Sharon,"You just said the C-word!
"
2,12,Randy,"Did I?
"
2,12,Stan,"This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
"
2,12,Stan,"Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
"
2,12,Stan,"Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
"
2,12,Kyle,"What? Why?
"
2,12,Stan,"Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
"
2,12,Cartman,"What are you guys doing?
"
2,12,Stan,"We're building a clubhouse.
"
2,12,Cartman,"A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!
"
2,12,Kyle,"It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
"
2,12,Cartman,"Wwwhy??
"
2,12,Kyle,"Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
"
2,12,Stan,"Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
"
2,12,Cartman,"That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
"
2,12,Kyle,"Fine!
"
2,12,Cartman,"Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!
"
2,12,Stan,"Fine!
"
2,12,Cartman,"Fine!
"
2,12,Kyle,"Fine!
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Fine!)
"
2,12,Kyle,"Fine!
"
2,12,Cartman,"Fine! That's fine. 
"
2,12,Stan,"Fine!
"
2,12,Cartman,"Fine!
"
2,12,Cartman,"No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--) 
"
2,12,Cartman,"Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker.
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Uh--)
"
2,12,Cartman,"No, Kenny.
"
2,12,Liane,"How's the treehouse coming along, hon?
"
2,12,Cartman,"Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!
"
2,12,Liane,"Sorry, hon.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
"
2,12,Liane,"Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.
"
2,12,Cartman,"But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!
"
2,12,Liane,"Well, all right.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.
"
2,12,Kenny,"(You suck ass and you suck dick!) 
"
2,12,Cartman,"And stop your bitchin'!
"
2,12,Sharon,"What are you doing, sweetheart?
"
2,12,Stan,"Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
"
2,12,Sharon,"You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie! 
"
2,12,Stan,"'Kay.
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?
"
2,12,Mr. Twig,"Uh- that's right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important--
"
2,12,Kyle,"When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"What did you say?!
"
2,12,Kyle,"When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!
"
2,12,Stan,"But Mr. Twig sucks.
"
2,12,Class,"Yeah.
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...
"
2,12,Cartman,"So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?
"
2,12,Stan,"Better than yours, fat boy.
"
2,12,Cartman,"We'll see about that.  Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny.
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Yes, sir..!)
"
2,12,Wendy,"Is the clubhouse ready?
"
2,12,Stan,"Almost.
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"Stan? Are you paying attention?
"
2,12,Stan,"Yes, Mr. Garrison.
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?
"
2,12,Stan,"Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.  Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh... 
"
2,12,Kyle,"Good guess, dude!
"
2,12,Stan,"Phew.
"
2,12,Bebe,"Pass this up.
"
2,12,Butters,"Pass this up.
"
2,12,Kevin,"Pass this up.
"
2,12,Fosse,"P-huh pass this h-up. 
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!
"
2,12,Stan,"No, I just--
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile.
"
2,12,Stan,"I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!
"
2,12,Stan,"But I didn't write the note!
"
2,12,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.
"
2,12,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!
"
2,12,Stan,"Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, mkay? Not for immature skylarkings.
"
2,12,Stan,"What's 'skylarkings'?
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"You know, like tomfooleries.
"
2,12,Stan,"Who?
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, your parents are here.
"
2,12,Stan,"Oh, no. 
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.
"
2,12,Randy,"Stanley, I... Skylarkings?
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Yeahmkay?
"
2,12,Randy,"Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
"
2,12,Sharon,"Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
"
2,12,Stan,"It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder.
"
2,12,Sharon,"You really should know better, Stanley.
"
2,12,Randy,"You need to shape up, mister.
"
2,12,Sharon,"Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?
"
2,12,Randy,"I don't interrupt you.
"
2,12,Sharon,"There, you did it again!  He interrupted me again.
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--
"
2,12,Randy,"Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation's bad.
"
2,12,Sharon,"Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Uuuhh. Mmm mkay.
"
2,12,Randy,"When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling.
"
2,12,Randy,"Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Mkay. That's valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--
"
2,12,Stan,"Excuse me.
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"-how do you feel?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
"
2,12,Randy,"Oh, please!
"
2,12,Stan,"Hello?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Oh, please yourself!
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?
"
2,12,Sharon,"He is. 
"
2,12,Randy,"No, she is. 
"
2,12,Sharon,"Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again! 
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Mmkay.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.  Oh, man!
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Uh huh)
"
2,12,Cartman,"And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
2,12,Cartman,"All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)
"
2,12,Cartman,"Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!  Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?
"
2,12,Kyle,"Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
"
2,12,Stan,"I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
"
2,12,Kyle,"To me??
"
2,12,Stan,"I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 
"
2,12,Kyle,"We should use nails, dude.
"
2,12,Stan,"My mom won't let us. 
"
2,12,Wendy,"Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?
"
2,12,Stan,"Pretty good. We're almost done.
"
2,12,Wendy,"Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!
"
2,12,Stan,"We're going as fast as we can!
"
2,12,Bebe,"Kyle, could you turn around for a second?  Thank you. 
"
2,12,Stan,"Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
"
2,12,Stan,"No.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
"
2,12,Stan,"I didn't even think about that.
"
2,12,Chef,"And then, they'll ask, ""Truth or Dare?'
"
2,12,Stan,"And I say, ""Dare!""
"
2,12,Chef,"No no! You say, ""Truth.""
"
2,12,Stan,"""Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her.
"
2,12,Chef,"You have to say ""Truth"" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager.
"
2,12,Stan,"Oooh.
"
2,12,Chef,"You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens.
"
2,12,Stan,"Yeah.
"
2,12,Chef,"Then, after a few ""Truth""s, you finally answer, ""Dare.""
"
2,12,Stan,"""Dare!""
"
2,12,Chef,"But not like that, son. Like this: ""Daaare"". 
"
2,12,Stan,"Oooh.
"
2,12,Chef,"And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
"
2,12,Stan,"You really think so?
"
2,12,Chef,"Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.
"
2,12,Stan,"Wow!
"
2,12,Fat Abbot,"Heeyy hey hey. What's goin' down, y'all?
"
2,12,Rudy,"Man, Fat Abbot. What are you doin' on this side of the 'hood?
"
2,12,Fat Abbot,"You know somethin', Rudy? You're like school in summertime.
"
2,12,Rudy,"School in summertime?
"
2,12,Fat Abbot,"Yeah, bitch, school in summertime!  Open yo' fuckin' ears and shit, ho, or I'll pop your bitch ass.
"
2,12,Donald,"I'llba poppa yourba bitcha assa tooba, bitcha.
"
2,12,Cartman,"What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?  Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Uh-huh) 
"
2,12,Blonde,"Hi. We ran away from home.
"
2,12,Brunette,"Well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Holy crap!  Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
"
2,12,Blonde,"Oh well, I guess it beats living at home.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? 
"
2,12,Stan,"Hello?
"
2,12,Cartman,"How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?
"
2,12,Stan,"We're working on it.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.
"
2,12,Stan,"No, you don't!  Dude!
"
2,12,Cartman,"It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.
"
2,12,Stan,"Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out.
"
2,12,Stan,"What?! Why?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Because, we're divorced, Stanley.
"
2,12,Stan,"Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Yeah, kind of.
"
2,12,Stan,"...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!
"
2,12,Sharon,"But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy.
"
2,12,Roy,"Hello, son.
"
2,12,Stan,"What?!
"
2,12,Sharon,"I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted. 
"
2,12,Roy,"Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me.
"
2,12,Stan,"This is happening way too fast.
"
2,12,Roy,"Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood! 
"
2,12,Blonde,"So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, ""Make sure you're home before midnight!""
"
2,12,Cartman,"Ahaw, that's weak.
"
2,12,Blonde,"And I go, ""Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!""
"
2,12,Cartman,"That's killer.
"
2,12,Blonde,"And she goes, ""Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!""
"
2,12,Cartman,"That's totally weak!
"
2,12,Blonde,"So I go, ""Fine! I won't come home!""
"
2,12,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
2,12,Blonde,"And then she goes, ""Fine! Don't come home!"", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Killer weak, sweet!
"
2,12,Blonde,"I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.  I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!
"
2,12,Cartman,"I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, ""Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"" 
"
2,12,Stan,"Okay. We're done.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 
"
2,12,Stan,"It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 
"
2,12,Kyle,"Okay.
"
2,12,Stan,"' G'oh?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Stanley, it's time to go!
"
2,12,Stan,"Go where?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you.
"
2,12,Stan,"But no! I have to get the girls to come-
"
2,12,Sharon,"Come on, Stanley! 
"
2,12,Stan,"Weak!  Dad?
"
2,12,Randy,"Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.
"
2,12,Stan,"But I don't understand why we have to--
"
2,12,Randy,"Well, hello, ladies.
"
2,12,Passenger,"Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight.
"
2,12,Randy,"I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.
"
2,12,Stan,"Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
"
2,12,Randy,"Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.
"
2,12,Stan,"But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
"
2,12,Randy,"Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day.
"
2,12,Stan,"What? That's it?
"
2,12,Randy,"Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.  You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?
"
2,12,Stan,"I guess, but-- 
"
2,12,Stan,"Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
"
2,12,Stan,"No way, dude! Don't be silly.
"
2,12,Bebe,"Come on, Wendy.
"
2,12,Stan,"We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right?
"
2,12,Kyle,"Right. Why?
"
2,12,Stan,"Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Too eager to what?
"
2,12,Stan,"To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez.
"
2,12,Wendy,"Hi, guys. 
"
2,12,Stan,"Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?
"
2,12,Bebe,"Don't you guys still wanna play ""Truth or Dare""?
"
2,12,Stan,"Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.
"
2,12,Bebe,"Then come on! 
"
2,12,Stan,"Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Okay.
"
2,12,Bebe,"Who wants to go first?
"
2,12,Wendy,"I will. Kyle?
"
2,12,Kyle,"Yeah?
"
2,12,Wendy,"Truth or Dare?
"
2,12,Kyle,"Umm. Dare?
"
2,12,Stan,"Dude!
"
2,12,Kyle,"What?
"
2,12,Wendy,"How about we give him Bebe?
"
2,12,Bebe,"Okay.
"
2,12,Wendy,"Okay.
"
2,12,Bebe,"Okay.
"
2,12,Wendy,"Kiss Bebe on the lips!
"
2,12,Kyle,"What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
"
2,12,Wendy,"What's the matter, Kyle?
"
2,12,Kyle,"It's just wrong, that's all.
"
2,12,Stan,"Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
"
2,12,Kyle,"What the hell have you gotten me into?!
"
2,12,Stan,"Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
"
2,12,Kyle,"Hoh boy.  Sick!  Aggghhh! Fucking sickening! 
"
2,12,Bebe,"Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!
"
2,12,Wendy,"Your turn, Bebe.
"
2,12,Bebe,"Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?  Stan, Truth or Dare?
"
2,12,Stan,"Dare.
"
2,12,Roy,"Son, could you please help me with the firewood?
"
2,12,Stan,"...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
"
2,12,Roy,"When will you let me in? Let me love you?! Now, get your ass out here and help me.
"
2,12,Wendy,"Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow.
"
2,12,Stan,"Crap!
"
2,12,Blonde,"I think you should be able to move out legally when you're fourteen.
"
2,12,Brunette,"Our moms won't even let us smoke.
"
2,12,Blonde,"Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!
"
2,12,Liane,"Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.  Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?
"
2,12,Cartman,"Coming, Mom.  Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!
"
2,12,Guy in Leather Jacket,"Hey, girls.
"
2,12,Guy with Long Hair,"What's up.
"
2,12,Blonde,"Oh hey, Scott.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Who the hell are you?!
"
2,12,Brunette,"Uh- we invited some people over. Hope you don't mind.
"
2,12,Cartman,"How many people?
"
2,12,Bebe,"Kyle, can I talk to you?
"
2,12,Kyle,"Okay.
"
2,12,Bebe,"Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Huh?
"
2,12,Bebe,"I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Okay, that's fine.
"
2,12,Bebe,"No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way.
"
2,12,Kyle,"But I don't care.
"
2,12,Bebe,"Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.  Okay, Clyde, we can go now.
"
2,12,Clyde,"Bitchin'. 
"
2,12,Host,"These are café curtains that require no sewing, and I know you all love that! 
"
2,12,Stan,"Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
"
2,12,Roy,"Nnuuhunuuhh.
"
2,12,Stan,"What?
"
2,12,Roy,"Chores. Do chores.
"
2,12,Stan,"My dad lets me watch cartoons.
"
2,12,Roy,"Well I'm not your dad. Okay? I'm not your dad! You- you can't just go around playing games with my emotions.
"
2,12,Sharon,"Stanley, what did you do to Roy?
"
2,12,Stan,"Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
"
2,12,Sharon,"Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?
"
2,12,Stan,"If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
"
2,12,Sharon,"Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, ""you're the most important thing to me,"" what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances.
"
2,12,Stan,"Oh.
"
2,12,Sharon,"Bye now. Roy! 
"
2,12,Stan,"Divorce is stupid. 
"
2,12,Fat Abbot,"Heeyy heeyy heeyy! Hey Yolanda. Why is your eye all black and blue and shit?
"
2,12,Yolanda,"Maaan, Fat Abbot. My stepdad popped me in my eye.
"
2,12,Fat Abbot,"Stepdad? You gotta off his ass!
"
2,12,Yolanda,"Really?
"
2,12,Fat Abbot,"Yeah, bitch! Snatch his ass in a bear trap! Leave that motherfucker swingin' from a tree so high nobody finds him for days! Glock-glock, you know what I'm sayin'? Dumbassed motherfucker pullin' shit! Damn!
"
2,12,Yolanda,"You're right, Fat Abbot. Thanks!
"
2,12,Fat Abbot,"No problem, ho. Maybe later you can suck my dick, bitch-ho! Shit!
"
2,12,Bill,"Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding.
"
2,12,Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. 
"
2,12,Older kid,"Hey, kid, give me some of those! 
"
2,12,Cartman,"Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
"
2,12,Blonde,"What? That game's for kids.
"
2,12,Cartman,"This is bullcrap! 
"
2,12,Randy,"Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.
"
2,12,Cartman,"This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse! 
"
2,12,Punk,"Mosh pit!
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Huh?) 
"
2,12,Cartman,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
2,12,Kyle,"You bastard!
"
2,12,Sharon,"Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?  Meet me in the clubhouse. 
"
2,12,Roy,"Sharon? Sharon, have you seen my copy of Harper's?  Meet me at the clubhouse.
"
2,12,Sharon,"Oh, Randy. What are you doing here? 
"
2,12,Randy,"I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.
"
2,12,Sharon,"Oh I thought that note was for me.
"
2,12,Randy,"Oh, maybe it was.
"
2,12,Sharon,"Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.
"
2,12,Randy,"I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
"
2,12,Sharon,"Goodnight.
"
2,12,Randy,"Sharon?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Yes? 
"
2,12,Randy,"Truth or Dare?
"
2,12,Sharon,"It's too late for games. 
"
2,12,Randy,"No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Truth.
"
2,12,Randy,"Do you still love me?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him.
"
2,12,Roy,"Sharon--  Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh.
"
2,12,Randy,"Well, you never know. Maybe--
"
2,12,Roy,"He-
"
2,12,Randy,"--thing will work out.
"
2,12,Roy,"Hello?
"
2,12,Sharon,"Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?
"
2,12,Roy,"Sharon?
"
2,12,Randy,"Dare.
"
2,12,Sharon,"Do me. Right here in the clubhouse. 
"
2,12,Roy,"Hello? Hel-lo? Could- could somebody get me d-? Hello?
"
2,12,Stan,"Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
"
2,12,Bebe,"Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
"
2,12,Stan,"Dare. 
"
2,12,Bebe,"Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.
"
2,12,Stan,"...What?!
"
2,12,Wendy,"Wow, that sucks!
"
2,12,Bebe,"Do you think it'll hurt?
"
2,12,Roy,"Hello? I sure am hungry. Anybody? It certainly does suck right here. Hello? Shuh- Sharon? Sharon, hello?
"
2,13,Host,"Well, Tom and Mary, you've made it to the final round. Are you ready to play for the grand prize?
"
2,13,Tom and Mary,"We're ready, Bob!
"
2,13,Bob,"Any particular prize you're hoping for?
"
2,13,Mary,"Well, Hawaii's nice, but Tahiti would be fun, too!
"
2,13,Tom,"Oh, anywhere would be great!
"
2,13,Bob,"Polynesian diggities. I wish you luck. Here we go. What is the thin flap of skin that runs from the base of the penis to the scrotum? 
"
2,13,Tom,"Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this. 
"
2,13,Mary,"The upper vascular hood.
"
2,13,Bob,"I'm sorry, but YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.  Heheh, tell them what they've won.
"
2,13,Announcer,"Tom and Mary, put on your cowboy hats, because you're going to beautiful South Park, Colorado! 
"
2,13,Mary,"Where?
"
2,13,Announcer,"That's right, just in time for Cows Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival.  Every fall, South Park celebrates Cow Days, and you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at the spectacular Super 7 hotel on Bernhardt Road , and enjoy festivities, including prizes, rides, and of course, the world-famous Running of the Cows!  Congratulations, Tom and Mary.
"
2,13,Bob,"Well, Tom, Mary, you must be very excited.
"
2,13,Tom,"What was second prize again?
"
2,13,Bob,"That's all for now. See you tomorrow on  ""Ooo, What The Hell Is That!"" 
"
2,13,Mary,"Shit!
"
2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!  As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cows.  And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!
"
2,13,Jimbo,"This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!  Which will live forever in South Park from this day forth. Release the curtain! 
"
2,13,Mary,"This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!
"
2,13,Tom,"Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it.
"
2,13,Mary,"Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We just need to stay positive.
"
2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
"
2,13,Toss-a-Ball Operator,"Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes. 
"
2,13,Kyle,"Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 
"
2,13,Stan,"Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.
"
2,13,Operator,"Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.
"
2,13,Stan,"Really?
"
2,13,Operator,"Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Wwow!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Dude, that kicks ass!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?
"
2,13,Operator,"Five dollars for three balls.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
"
2,13,Operator,"Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"That's easy!
"
2,13,Operator,"Okay, we've got a player!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Ay! Check it out!  Damn it!
"
2,13,Operator,"Okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt! 
"
2,13,Kyle,"You suck, Cartman!
"
2,13,Cartman,"I'd like to see you do better!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
"
2,13,Operator,"It's gotta go through her mouth
"
2,13,Kyle,"But ih-
"
2,13,Operator,"Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
"
2,13,Cartman,"I only have three dollars left, asshole!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 
"
2,13,Jimbo,"Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows! 
"
2,13,Kyle,"Mom, give me some money!
"
2,13,Sheila,"Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!
"
2,13,Kyle,"I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2,13,Sheila,"Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out in the street!
"
2,13,Kyle,"I will if you give me money!
"
2,13,Sheila,"Okay, here! 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
2,13,Jimbo,"Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.  With that said, let's rock and roll!  Everybody ready to run?  Release the cows!  They're loose! 
"
2,13,Cows,"Mooooo?!
"
2,13,Ned,"Ow.
"
2,13,Jimbo,"Yeehaw!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
"
2,13,Cartman,"I only need one, dude. I only need one.
"
2,13,Operator,"Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts.
"
2,13,Stan,"What's that?
"
2,13,Operator,"Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
"
2,13,Cartman,"How much is it?
"
2,13,Operator,"Just three tickets, boys.  Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Is it like a- haunted house or something?
"
2,13,Operator,"Sure. It's veery scary.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
"
2,13,Kyle,"No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Oh come on, you guys. We still have plenty of money left over.
"
2,13,Kyle,"You'd better be right, dude.
"
2,13,Cartman,"I'm right!
"
2,13,Operator,"Keep your hands in at all times.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Okay.
"
2,13,Operator,"So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS! 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Eh! God-damnit! 
"
2,13,Stan,"What the hell was that?
"
2,13,Operator,"Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!  All right, boys. Ride's over.
"
2,13,Kyle,"That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
"
2,13,Stan,"Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
"
2,13,Cartman,"I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
"
2,13,Kyle,"That was a waste of money, Cartman!
"
2,13,Operator,"Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets.
"
2,13,Kyle,"We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.  Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!
"
2,13,Kyle,"This ride better be good!
"
2,13,Stan,"Yeah, this line is way too long!
"
2,13,Cartman,"I think we're almost to the end.
"
2,13,Kyle,"We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
"
2,13,Stan,"Here we go. 
"
2,13,Kyle,"Finally!
"
2,13,Line Ride Operator,"Did ya enjoy the ride?
"
2,13,Stan,"What ride?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
2,13,Line Ride Operator,"This was the Line Ride, a real live simulator of a long line.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
"
2,13,Line Ride Operator,"That's five tickets, thank you very much.  Come see us again soon.
"
2,13,Stan,"My ass we will!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
"
2,13,Stan,"Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.
"
2,13,Photo Seller,"Would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the Line Ride? 
"
2,13,Cartman,"How much?
"
2,13,Photo Seller,"Just three dollars.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet. 
"
2,13,Kyle,"You dumbass, Cartman!
"
2,13,Cartman,"What? This is cool.
"
2,13,Kyle,"No, it's not cool!
"
2,13,Cartman,"It is, too! 
"
2,13,Operator,"Can I help you boys.
"
2,13,Stan,"We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
"
2,13,Operator,"O-kay, five dollars for three balls.
"
2,13,Kyle,"How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Aah, three dollars.
"
2,13,Kyle,"What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.
"
2,13,Kyle,"You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Ey! Seriously!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
"
2,13,Kenny,"(What? These?)
"
2,13,Stan,"Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
"
2,13,Operator,"Sure, as long as they're good.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Give him your food stamps, Kenny!
"
2,13,Kenny,"(Nuh uh)
"
2,13,Kyle,"Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
"
2,13,Kenny,"(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)
"
2,13,Cartman,"Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends! 
"
2,13,Kyle,"Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
"
2,13,Operator,"Sorry, kid. Try again.
"
2,13,Kyle,"That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS!
"
2,13,Operator,"Uhwhat are you doing?
"
2,13,Kyle,"I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
"
2,13,Operator,"Shenanigans?
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"What's all the hoo-ha?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Why?
"
2,13,Kyle,"This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.  What do you have to say, carnival operator?
"
2,13,Operator,"Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son.  Here you go.  There, you see? We have a winner!
"
2,13,Kyle,"It worked!
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!
"
2,13,Stan,"Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Barbrady!
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"You said Buttbaby. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
2,13,Operator,"Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick.
"
2,13,Kyle,"No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
"
2,13,Operator,"Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those.
"
2,13,Kyle,"What?!
"
2,13,Operator,"You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade them in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2,13,Kyle,"You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
"
2,13,Operator,"Step on up, just five dollars to play!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Damnit, I have to have those dolls! 
"
2,13,Stan,"This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
"
2,13,Cartman,"What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
"
2,13,Cartman,"O-kay, I'll- get on the bull.
"
2,13,Kyle,"All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! 
"
2,13,Stan,"He really wants those dolls.
"
2,13,Cartman,"I guess, damn!
"
2,13,Mary,"That ride wasn't very good.
"
2,13,Tom,"Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time.
"
2,13,Mary,"You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll try and have a good time.
"
2,13,Stan,"Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hey, this is sweet.
"
2,13,Kyle,"You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
"
2,13,Cartman,"I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
"
2,13,Stan,"We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Yikes!  Ow!  Son of a bitch!
"
2,13,Stan,"How long was that?
"
2,13,Kyle,"That wasn't quite ten seconds.
"
2,13,Stan,"Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
"
2,13,Cartman,"You guys, eh seriously, my back!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Seriously. Help.  Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
"
2,13,Kyle,"What'd you say, Cartman??
"
2,13,Cartman,"I hate you guys!
"
2,13,Kyle,"I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hate you guys.
"
2,13,Rancher,"Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
"
2,13,Rancher,"Well, have fun, boys. 
"
2,13,Kyle,"Okay, Cartman. You ready?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Nnoo.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Open the gate! 
"
2,13,Cartman,"All right, get down. This is my kind of bullride.
"
2,13,Kyle,"That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Yeah, this is sweet!
"
2,13,Stan,"What are you going to do?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.
"
2,13,Stan,"Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Eeyy!
"
2,13,Kyle,"That's better.
"
2,13,Stan,"Hold on, Cartman!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Ey! Seriously, dude! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!  Mother f- 
"
2,13,Kyle,"Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 
"
2,13,Stan,"Come on, Cartman. 
"
2,13,Kenny,"(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)
"
2,13,Kyle,"No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 
"
2,13,Stan,"You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Dude, I think we broke him.
"
2,13,Dr. Doctor,"Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma.
"
2,13,Stan,"What's the matter with him.
"
2,13,Dr. Doctor,"Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li.
"
2,13,Kyle,"..Oh.
"
2,13,Stan,"But can he still ride a bull?
"
2,13,Dr. Doctor,"What?
"
2,13,Kyle,"We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
"
2,13,Dr. Doctor,"No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep. 
"
2,13,Kyle,"Damn it!
"
2,13,Stan,"Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Boinsure li bonsure.
"
2,13,Stan,"What?!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Boyongture taur lur mahrter.
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh, he's fine, dude.
"
2,13,Kyle,"You think?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Shunkarah puntaur lah-turi.
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
"
2,13,Jimbo,"All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!  Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked.  Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial! 
"
2,13,Mary,"Where are we going to put a 60-foot tall statue of a cow?
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists. 
"
2,13,Mary,"Oh my God!
"
2,13,Stan,"How's he doing?
"
2,13,Kyle,"He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har.
"
2,13,Stan,"Do you think he can ride the bull?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Yeah, I think so.
"
2,13,Stan,"Cool. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!
"
2,13,Soldier,"Huh?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hello? Soldier boy. Me so horny. Me love you long time.
"
2,13,Soldier,"Go away, kid. You're grossing me out.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!
"
2,13,Soldier,"Beat it, kid! Come on, honey. 
"
2,13,Chamber of Farts Operator,"Come one, come all! The Chamber of Farts has been fixed and is reopen! 
"
2,13,Stan,"Jesus, dude!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Hey, where's Cartman?
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh, hell!
"
2,13,Kenny,"(I don't know where he went!)
"
2,13,Stan,"Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
"
2,13,Kenny,"(Okay.)
"
2,13,Tom,"Huh, it's so cold here.
"
2,13,Mary,"Where is that sheriff?! We need water!
"
2,13,Tom,"Oh well, let's try to make the best of it, Mary.
"
2,13,Mary,"You're right. We're not being positive. At least we get some time alone.
"
2,13,Tom,"Yeah, and at least we've got our health. 
"
2,13,Grey Hat,"I tell you, Mitchell, I ain't never seen nothin' like it.
"
2,13,Mitchell,"Where are they again?
"
2,13,Grey Hat,"Just right up over this ridge.  That's what they've been doin' all morning: sittin' there and mooin'. And more cows come all the time.
"
2,13,Mitchell,"Well, I ain't never seen this before, neither. But I know one thing: when cows start gettin' together, it can't be good. They might start formin' a cult!
"
2,13,Grey Hat,"Hm. Cow cult.
"
2,13,Announcer,"The grand-daddy of them all, the South Park Cow Days Rodeo! Let's begin the bullriding event. Grand prize: $5000!
"
2,13,Stan,"Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!
"
2,13,Kenny,"(I don't know. I can't find him.)
"
2,13,Kyle,"He's up in, like, twenty minutes!
"
2,13,Kenny,"(All right! I know!)
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hello, fren! Hello!
"
2,13,Stan,"There he is!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Sucky-sucky, five dollar.
"
2,13,Grey Hat,"There they are, just like we told you. 
"
2,13,Jimbo,"Okay, that's enough o' that! You cows need to dis-perse!  All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!  All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!
"
2,13,Ned,"Mmmm-gahyah! Git along, little doggies!  Bad cows stay! Stay!  AAAAAH!
"
2,13,Jimbo,"Holy smokes! Play dead, Ned!
"
2,13,Grey Hat,"I reckon we should get some help.
"
2,13,Mitchell,"I reckon.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
"
2,13,Stan,"Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hucky-sucky five dollar.
"
2,13,Announcer,"Up first, No. 24, Jack McMack!  Three, two, one. 
"
2,13,Jack,"Yeehaw! Yeeha! Yeehaw!  Aaaaaaaa! 
"
2,13,Announcer,"Oooh, that's gonna cost him a point deduction.  Up next, no. 14, Ming Li!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me eight dollar, soldier boy!
"
2,13,Announcer,"Here we go!
"
2,13,Stan,"Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.
"
2,13,Kyle,"What do you mean?
"
2,13,Stan,"I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
"
2,13,Announcer,"Let her go! 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Hang on, Cartman! 
"
2,13,Announcer,"Wow, and this Vietnamese prostitute can really ride a bull!  I guess she's had a lot of practice, if you know what I mean. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Aaah! Ten dollar!  Ten dollar, soldier boy!
"
2,13,Announcer,"She's setting a new world record!
"
2,13,Crowd,"Ming Li! Ming Li! Ming Li!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Gaaah!  Heeee!
"
2,13,Stan,"Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Go help him, Kenny!
"
2,13,Kenny,"(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!) 
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
2,13,Kyle,"You bastard! 
"
2,13,Announcer,"And this brave little whore from the East has really put on a show for us today!  The winner of the bullriding contest: Ming Li!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar.
"
2,13,Stan,"We did it, dude, we did it! 
"
2,13,Agent,"Freeze, cows!  The game is over! You will now return to your respective towns! 
"
2,13,Jimbo,"You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!
"
2,13,Agent,"You will now all march in an orderly fashion into this trailer!  Move! 
"
2,13,Jimbo,"Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow! 
"
2,13,Agent,"Oh, dear Jesus, no!
"
2,13,Cow,"Mooooo!
"
2,13,Jinbo,"Nnoo!  They're killing themselves! Stop! Please!  Can't we do anything?! Oh, God, the humanity, Ned! The humanity! 
"
2,13,Agent,"This is the first mass cow suicide I've seen in- at least eight months.
"
2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Oh, you boys are back again, huh?
"
2,13,Stan,"Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
"
2,13,Kyle,"How many ball does that get us?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Odline daur shunba shunba?
"
2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Aw I ah- I tell you what, boys. Uh, I'm gonna be really nice and just- trade you the 5000 for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2,13,Kyle,"You will?
"
2,13,Stan,"Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 
"
2,13,Kyle,"We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Ten dollar? Sucky-sucky?
"
2,13,Kyle,"What are we gonna do with them?
"
2,13,Stan,"We should- 
"
2,13,Kyle,"..What the-?
"
2,13,Stan,"Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs! 
"
2,13,Kyle,"After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! 
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"What's all this?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
"
2,13,Mr. Garrison,"You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all!
"
2,13,Father Maxi,"Yeah, and the food is terrible!
"
2,13,Chamber of Farts Operator,"Hey, it's just a stupid rodeo. What do you expect?
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?
"
2,13,Townspeople,"Yeah!
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?
"
2,13,Woman,"..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans! 
"
2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"You found it! You found the memorial!
"
2,13,Jimbo,"Yep.
"
2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"And the cows? Are they all back, too?
"
2,13,Jimbo,"They're dead, mayor. They're all dead. 
"
2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"What?!
"
2,13,Jimbo,"Oho, it was awful!  Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!
"
2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing.
"
2,13,Jimbo,"I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. Uhud I need a cold beer and a burger.  What's all the ruckus over there? 
"
2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans!
"
2,13,Jimbo,"Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with-  Oooooh? 
"
2,13,Jimbo,"Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Yeah.
"
2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"Didn't we ever release them?
"
2,13,Jimbo,"Aw, I forgot all about them.
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Uh me, too.
"
2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell.
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"I didn't?
"
2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them.
"
2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison.
"
2,13,Stan,"Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
"
2,13,Cartman,"What are you guys doing?
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Really? What about?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.  Eeyy, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh-h. Nowhere. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
"
2,13,Kyle,"No! Cartman, that was just a dream!
"
2,13,Leonardo DiCaprio,"Bye, Ming Li. Thanks again. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Oh! Son of a bitch!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Stinky britches, you got stinky britchesStinky, stinky britches, you got stinky--
"
2,14,Kyle,"What the hell are you singing, Cartman?
"
2,14,Cartman,"This new song by Alanis Morissette. I can’t get it out of my head.Stinky britches, you got stinky britches
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Hello, children. Ready for lunch?
"
2,14,Cartman,"Stinky britches, you got stinky, stinky--
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, is there a problem?
"
2,14,Cartman,"Yeah, I can’t get this stupid song out of my head.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"""Stinky Britches"" by Alanis Morissette?
"
2,14,Cartman,"Yeah. Stinky, stinky britches
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?
"
2,14,Mr. Twig,"Hi, boys. How are you?
"
2,14,Kyle,"When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"I told you never say his name in my presence.
"
2,14,Stan,"But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
"
2,14,Kid,"Yeah.
"
2,14,Cartman,"Stinky britches, you got stinky--
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--
"
2,14,Kyle,"He'd be better used as a coat rack. 
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"How dare you! Come on, Mr. Twig. 
"
2,14,Chef,"Hello there, children.
"
2,14,Boys,"Hey, Chef.
"
2,14,Cartman,"You got stinky britches, stinky--
"
2,14,Chef,"What did you say?
"
2,14,Kyle,"He singing some new hit song.
"
2,14,Chef,"Eric, where did you hear that song?
"
2,14,Cartman,"It’s all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.
"
2,14,Chef,"Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas.
"
2,14,Stan,"What, dude?
"
2,14,Chef,"Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago.
"
2,14,Cartman,"You wrote it?
"
2,14,Chef,"Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Wow, then you should get money for it!
"
2,14,Chef,"Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
"
2,14,Chef,"Well, all right. Maybe I will go. I’ll play them my version of the song.
"
2,14,Chef (recording),"Stinky britches, you got those stinky britches.
"
2,14,Chef,"So you see, Mr. Big Record Producer,  ""Stinky Britches"" was something I wrote several years ago.
"
2,14,Producer,"Hmm… I really so no resemblance between that song and ""Stinky Britches"" by our artist, Alanis Morissette.
"
2,14,Chef,"Huh?
"
2,14,Kyle,"It’s the same goddamn song!
"
2,14,Chef,"Now, look, I’m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!
"
2,14,Producer,"I am above the law!  Mr. Chef, I’m afraid you leave me no alternative. We’re going to sue you.
"
2,14,Chef,"Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and you’re gonna sue me?
"
2,14,Producer,"Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business.
"
2,14,Kyle,"We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Yeah, and he’s Jewish.
"
2,14,Alanis Morissette,"Stinky, stinky britches, stinky britches
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Twig, is that you?  Mis-Mr. Twig?  Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!  Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!
"
2,14,Gerald,"Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down.
"
2,14,Chef,"Right. 
"
2,14,Judge Moses,"This court is now in session. Who's representing the defense?
"
2,14,Gerald,"I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski.
"
2,14,Judge Moses,"And representing the prosecution?
"
2,14,Prosecutor,"I am, Your Honor. Johnnie Cochran. 
"
2,14,Gerald,"Uh-oh.
"
2,14,Chef,"Why ""uh-oh""?
"
2,14,Gerald,"Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O. J. off.
"
2,14,Chef,"Uh-oh.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns! 
"
2,14,Dr. Doctor,"Give the child to me. 
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Is he going to be all right, doctor?
"
2,14,Dr. Doctor,"Uhhh…
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Is he going to live?
"
2,14,Dr. Doctor,"It's a stick.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!
"
2,14,Reporter,"And so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the…day, Johnnie Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous Chewbacca defense?
"
2,14,Cartman,"What's a Chewbacca defense?
"
2,14,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
2,14,Stan,"That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
"
2,14,Cartman,"Goddamn,  I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, ""Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!""
"
2,14,Kyle,"I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
"
2,14,Gerald,"And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.  We've got 'em. 
"
2,14,Judge Moses,"Mr. Johnnie Cochran, your closing arguments.
"
2,14,Cochran,"Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote ""Stinky Britches"" ten years ago. And they make a good case. Hell, I almost felt pity myself. But ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, I have one, final, thing I want you to consider.  Ladies and gentleman, this is Chewbacca.  Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about that. That does not make sense.
"
2,14,Gerald,"Dammit..!
"
2,14,Chef,"What?
"
2,14,Gerald,"He’s using the Chewbacca defense.
"
2,14,Cochran,"Why would a Wookiee, an 8-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall Ewoks? That does not make sense! But more important, you have to ask yourself: ""What does this have to do with this case?"" Nothing.  Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! It does not make sense! Look at me, I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation... does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests.
"
2,14,Judge Moses,"O-kay, then.
"
2,14,Cartman,"Wow, he’s good.
"
2,14,Reporter,"In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnnie Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense.  Whether or it worked... is up to the jury to decide.
"
2,14,Judge Moses,"How find you find the jury?
"
2,14,Foreman,"We find the defendant, Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy… guilty as charged. 
"
2,14,Gerald,"Whoops.
"
2,14,Chef,"Whoops?!
"
2,14,Judge Moses,"Mr. Chef, you have been found guilty of harassing a major company label. The full fee of $2 million will be handed over within 24 hours.
"
2,14,Chef,"Do I look like I have $2 million?
"
2,14,Judge Moses,"Well, you have 24 hours to find it, or else you have to go to jail. For eight million years. 
"
2,14,Bailiff,"Uh, it's actually for four years.
"
2,14,Judge Moses,"Oh, sorry. You'll got to jail for four years.
"
2,14,Chef,"This can't be happening..!
"
2,14,Stan,"Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
"
2,14,Producer,"And that chair, too. I want that chair.
"
2,14,Chef,"Hey, that's my favorite chair!
"
2,14,Producer,"You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too.
"
2,14,Stan,"Hello there, Chef.
"
2,14,Chef,"Hey, children.
"
2,14,Kyle,"What's going on?
"
2,14,Chef,"Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with $2 million, I'm going to jail.
"
2,14,Stan,"Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Yeah. Ready, Cartman?
"
2,14,Cartman,"Ready. I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-laI hope my will enjoy my danceFiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ayWould you like some sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--
"
2,14,Chef,"Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better.
"
2,14,Stan,"You do?
"
2,14,Chef,"Sure. Just please stop.
"
2,14,Cartman,"See? I told you guys it would work.
"
2,14,Kyle,"What's that, dude?
"
2,14,Chef,"This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Did you ever know any famous people?
"
2,14,Chef,"Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.
"
2,14,Cartman,"What's that?
"
2,14,Chef,"Nothing.  Anyway--
"
2,14,Producer,"Take this, too.
"
2,14,Chef,"Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!
"
2,14,Producer,"I can take whatever I want.
"
2,14,Chef,"But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!
"
2,14,Producer,"I am above the law!  I told you not to mess with me.
"
2,14,Chef,"That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that $2 million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!
"
2,14,Producer,"You wouldn’t.
"
2,14,Chef,"Watch me. Now get the fudge out of my house!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better?  I don't know who would want to hurt you like this, but I promise nobody will ever hurt you again, ever.  Mist-Mr. Twig... are you okay? Mist-Mr. Twig..?  Aaaggghhh!! Mr. Twig is broken in half! Who did this?!  You won't get away with this, you bastards!
"
2,14,Chef,"Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran.  Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million.
"
2,14,Stan,"Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
"
2,14,Chef,"Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them.
"
2,14,Kyle,"You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
"
2,14,Chef,"I appreciate that, children,  but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do.  My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.  Wish me luck, children. 
"
2,14,Stan,"We've gotta help him, dude.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Yeah, b-but how?
"
2,14,Stan,"Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
"
2,14,Kyle,"Whoa, dude, this house is huge.
"
2,14,Stan,"Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.
"
2,14,Cartman,"No, it isn't, you guys. 
"
2,14,Butler,"Can I help you?
"
2,14,Cartman,"We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.  Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
"
2,14,Kyle,"Are you Elton John?
"
2,14,Bulter,"No, I’m one of his butlers.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?
"
2,14,Elton,"Sir Elton John. I was knighted, you know.
"
2,14,Kyle,"We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
"
2,14,Cartman,"We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies…
"
2,14,Elton,"I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan.
"
2,14,Cartman,"What?!
"
2,14,Stan,"Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
"
2,14,Elton,"Chef? You mean Chef-Chef?
"
2,14,Kyle,"Yeah, dude.
"
2,14,Stan,"Wow, you remember him?
"
2,14,Elton,"Of course. I haven't seen him for so long. I remember when I first met him. It was about 25 years ago.
"
2,14,Elton,"I was a struggling musician who couldn't get a break.
"
2,14,Elton,"Oh, oh, you're my cheddar cheese girlYou're soft but firm, and you go well with wineOh oh, cheddar cheese girlCheddar, cheddar cheese girl
"
2,14,Man,"Boo! 
"
2,14,Chef,"Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up.
"
2,14,Elton,"Thanks, Chef. I just don't understand what my music is missing.
"
2,14,Chef,"Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics.
"
2,14,Elton,"I really thought I had it this time with ""Cheddar Cheese Girl"".
"
2,14,Chef,"What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.
"
2,14,Elton,"That's a great idea!
"
2,14,Chef,"And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know; some slick glasses and shit.
"
2,14,Elton,"And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never have had a career in music.
"
2,14,Stan,"So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
"
2,14,Elton,"Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums.
"
2,14,Cartman,"Three Crispy Yum Yums.
"
2,14,Stan,"Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
"
2,14,Elton,"Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive worldwide rights,  including but not limited to Asian territories, with a 20% commission from all domestic sales, and sole ownership of any and all publishing.
"
2,14,Stan,"'Kay.
"
2,14,Elton,"Tell Chef I said hi.
"
2,14,Stan,"Thanks, dude.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
"
2,14,Sheila,"Oy..! Thank you, Chef.
"
2,14,Chef,"No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?
"
2,14,Sheila,"Oh, of course!  Here you go.  Leaving so soon?
"
2,14,Chef,"I have a lo-o-o-o-o-ong way to come to go to raise the kind of money I need. 
"
2,14,Sheila,"Well, best of luck to you, then.
"
2,14,Gerald,"How was it, honey?
"
2,14,Sheila,"Pretty much what I expected.
"
2,14,Stan,"Hello, are you Meat Loaf?
"
2,14,Meat Loaf,"Yeah. What the hell do you want?
"
2,14,Cartman,"Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.
"
2,14,Kyle,"He’s not dying, Cartman!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Shut your goddamn mouth.  We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--
"
2,14,Meat Loaf,"What's this for?
"
2,14,Stan,"Our friend, Chef.
"
2,14,Meat Loaf,"Chef's in trouble?
"
2,14,Kyle,"Yeah. Do you know him?
"
2,14,Meat Loaf,"Do I?
"
2,14,Cous-Cous,"Nobody came again.
"
2,14,Chef,"There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image.
"
2,14,Cous-Cous,"What do you mean?
"
2,14,Chef,"Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name.
"
2,14,Cous-Cous,"Beefy? Like, uhh… Tri-tip!
"
2,14,Chef,"That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf.
"
2,14,Meat Loaf,"I owe everything to Chef.
"
2,14,Stan,"Wow! So you'll help him?
"
2,14,Meat Loaf,"You bet. Give me a box of Nilla Yum Yums and a couple of Berry Bars.
"
2,14,Boys,"Cool!
"
2,14,Ms. Crabtree,"All right, let's get this show on the road! Come here, baby!
"
2,14,Chef,"Uh-uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree. How would you like to use some… sex toys?
"
2,14,Ms. Crabtree,"Sex toys? Like what?
"
2,14,Chef,"Like this very special device.  I call it ""Chef’s pleasure bag"".
"
2,14,Ms. Crabtree,"How does it work?
"
2,14,Chef,"Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure.
"
2,14,Ms. Crabtree,"Really? Well, hell, let's give it a shot. 
"
2,14,Chef,"Ahh, yeah. That's much better.
"
2,14,Rick James,"Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give me a box of those Choco-Numbers. 
"
2,14,Kyle,"Gosh, thanks, Rick James.
"
2,14,Stan,"Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
"
2,14,Mayor,"Ohh, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show.
"
2,14,Chef,"I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.
"
2,14,Mayor,"Oh, come on, buck up, little fella.
"
2,14,Chef,"I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it.
"
2,14,Mayor,"Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp.  Aw, hell..!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you for coming, Officer Barbrady.
"
2,14,Barbrady,"What's this all about?
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"These pictures just arrived.  I set up a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant red-handed.  Now, go arrest him!  What..?
"
2,14,Barbrady,"Can I go now?
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Yes—Yes, I’m sorry.
"
2,14,Barbrady,"Weirdo.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"It can't be. These can't be right.  Mr. Hat!
"
2,14,Stan,"Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
"
2,14,Chef,"It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail.
"
2,14,Stan,"No, you don't!
"
2,14,Chef,"Huh?
"
2,14,Kyle,"We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
"
2,14,Chef,"Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?
"
2,14,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
2,14,Cartman,"Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated here.
"
2,14,Chef,"Oh.
"
2,14,Kyle,"But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
"
2,14,Chef,"I made about $410,300, but--
"
2,14,Producer,"That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!
"
2,14,Stan,"You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
"
2,14,Producer,"I am above the law! 
"
2,14,Officer,"All right, you, it's time to go.
"
2,14,Chef,"Goodbye, children. Thanks for all your help.
"
2,14,Officer,"Let's go. 
"
2,14,Chef,"Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!
"
2,14,Officer,"I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine.
"
2,14,Chef,"Ow! (whack) Ow!
"
2,14,Kyle,"Dude… Chef is gone.
"
2,14,Stan,"No more Chef.
"
2,14,Cartman,"No more Salisbury steak and… pecan pie. 
"
2,14,Stan,"We can't let him down, you guys.
"
2,14,Stan,"Dude, it's over. He's gone.
"
2,14,Stan,"No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
"
2,14,Cartman,"Four.
"
2,14,Kyle,"But what are we gonna do?
"
2,14,Stan,"It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Chef Aid?
"
2,14,Stan,"Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Hey, that's a great idea!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left.  I'm not going to take you back.  You can just go to hell!  You go to hell and you die!  You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!  I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!  What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
"
2,14,Dr. Doctor,"It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it. We had enough.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"What do you mean?
"
2,14,Barbrady,"I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"What? Jail?
"
2,14,Cartman,"I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-la I hope my will enjoy my dance Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
"
2,14,Kyle,"Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
"
2,14,Stan,"Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Would you like sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut, Fräulein Setski 
"
2,14,Elton,"Howdy ho, boys.
"
2,14,Stan,"Elton John! What are you doing here?
"
2,14,Elton,"It occurred to me that you might need some more help raising money for Chef.
"
2,14,Stan,"Boy, do we!
"
2,14,Elton,"So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over. 
"
2,14,Kyle,"Wow, cool!
"
2,14,Elton,"I see you've got a stage all set up for us.
"
2,14,Stan,"Yeah, dude, it's all yours.
"
2,14,Elton,"Then, let’s rock and roll! Or something similar.
"
2,14,Cartman/ Kenny,"Hooray!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"...And Mr. Twig is at home; he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history.
"
2,14,Chef,"You finally snapped, huh, Garrison?
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"What?
"
2,14,Chef,"Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"I warn you, Chef, don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell.
"
2,14,Chef,"What?!
"
2,14,Teen MC,"Okay, thanks for coming to Chef Aid, everybody! Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?!  Whoo!  All right, let's get things going with… Rancid!  Ran-cid! 
"
2,14,Rancid,"California sun has sunk Behind the Anaheim Hills, here it comes tonight I was high on junk--
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"You're still aren't entertaining ideas of raping me in this prison cell, are you, Chef?
"
2,14,Chef,"No, Garrison! Shut the hell up!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"That's good. 
"
2,14,Chef,"What the..?
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, boy, we're free!  Wow, what a daring rescue.  Mr. Hat!  Mr. Hat saved us, Chef!  Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat.
"
2,14,Chef,"How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?
"
2,14,Rick James,"Mmmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmmm…
"
2,14,Teen MC,"Rick James, ladies and gentlemen!
"
2,14,Rick James,"God bless you, Chef!
"
2,14,Teen MC,"And now here's your favorite band, Primus! Whoo!
"
2,14,Les Claypool,"We're damned proud to be here to support our good buddy, Chef. It was Chef who told us in the early days, to keep trying and to keep pursuing our dreams, no matter how much we sucked. I love that man. 
"
2,14,Mr. Mackey,"Whooaa..!
"
2,14,Producer,"What are you bastards doing?
"
2,14,Kyle,"We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
"
2,14,Producer,"Oh, yeah? We’ll just see about this!
"
2,14,Teen MC,"And now, here’s Joe Strummer!  Whoo!
"
2,14,Joe Strummer,"You know, when The Clash were on tour and we lost the beat, Chef would be like at the side of the stage going, ""Don't forget, pump your loins, children."" You know, that was like his motto or something.
"
2,14,Teen MC,"Whoo!
"
2,14,Strummer,"Well, it's a rockin' worldMake no mistake about it It's a shocking world Could be what's so great about itIt's a rockin' world...
"
2,14,Chef,"What the hell is this? 
"
2,14,Everyone,"Welcome to Chef Aid, Chef!
"
2,14,Stan,"Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
"
2,14,Chef,"Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?
"
2,14,Kyle,"Well, we helped.
"
2,14,Stan,"We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.
"
2,14,Chef,"I don’t believe it!
"
2,14,Producer,"We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts. 
"
2,14,Teen MC,"And now, here he is: TV's Ozzy Osbourne!
"
2,14,Ozzy,"We're all here to help our good friend, Chef, who has touched our lives in the past.  I remember when I was just starting out, Chef suggested I buy a pompadour hat. I thought he said, ""Bite the head off a bat"", so I did. And the rest, oh, it's just history. Now, let's go crazyyy! Ain't nowhere to run Ain't nowhere to hide  Aarrggghhh!!!
"
2,14,Kenny,"(All right dude, let me go now!) 
"
2,14,Stan,"Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
"
2,14,Kyle,"You bastard!
"
2,14,Teen MC,"And now here’s Ween! 
"
2,14,Dean,"We're thrilled to be part of Chef Aid.
"
2,14,Gene,"Chef was the guy who told us to do a country album.
"
2,14,Dean,"No, dude, that was Steve's idea.
"
2,14,Gene,"Oh. Then who's Chef?
"
2,14,Dean,"I don't know, dude. I thought you knew him.
"
2,14,Gene,"Oh, well. Anyways, here's our song!
"
2,14,Ween,"Many colors in my homo rainbowDon't be afraid to let your colors shine
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you.
"
2,14,Mr. Twig,"Did you love him?
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"It doesn't matter. He left me.
"
2,14,Mr. Twig,"Did you love him?
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Yes.
"
2,14,Mr. Twig,"Then run to him.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"But I feel like I'm making the wrong decision.
"
2,14,Mr. Twig,"Love isn't a decision, it’s a feeling. If we could decide who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you. 
"
2,14,Teen MC,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John! Whoo! 
"
2,14,Elton,"Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a very special little boy.  I have no idea what his name is, but who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend. Wake up, Wendy Smell the coffee...
"
2,14,Kyle,"Hey, that's your song for Wendy!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Ha-ha, you're a wuss. 
"
2,14,Producer,"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win!
"
2,14,Narrator,"And what happened then? Well, in South Park they say  Johnnie Cochran's heart grew three sizes that day. 
"
2,14,Cochran,"Wait!  Mr. Chef, this music has really touched me. I like to take up your case, free of charge!
"
2,14,Chef,"You will?
"
2,14,Cochran,"I will. 
"
2,14,Producer,"No!
"
2,14,Cochran,"We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer.
"
2,14,Producer,"Noooooooo!
"
2,14,Cochran,"Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client, Chef.  I know he seems guilty, but ladies and gentlemen, this… is Chewbacca.  Now think about that for one minute. That does not make sense. Why am I talkin' about Chewbacca when a man's life is on the line?  Why? I tell you why. I don't know. It doesn't make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit!  Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey. 
"
2,14,Reporter,"Chef, how does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song, ""Stinky Britches""?
"
2,14,Chef,"It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children.
"
2,14,Reporter,"So, what are you gonna do now?
"
2,14,Chef,"Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
"
2,14,Stan/Kyle/ Cartman,"Hooray!
"
2,15,Announcer,"The following program is brought to you in spooky vision. Be warned: all scenes will be accompanied by pictures of Barbra Streisand. 
"
2,15,Stan,"I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
"
2,15,Kyle,"He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Hey guys. How's it going? 
"
2,15,Kyle,"Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
"
2,15,Stan,"Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
"
2,15,Kyle,"Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
"
2,15,Cartman,"You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up.
"
2,15,Stan,"What?
"
2,15,Cartman,"I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed.  I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
"
2,15,Kyle,"What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
"
2,15,Stan,"Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too? 
"
2,15,Stan,"Dude, this is creepy.
"
2,15,Sharon,"Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo. 
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"Hello, Stanley. Remember me?
"
2,15,Stanley,"Hi, Aunt Flo. 
"
2,15,Sharon,"Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice.
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"Hey, Stanley. I brought you and Shelly presents.
"
2,15,Stan,"Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo! 
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"Okay, Shelly. This one's for you.  It's a television/CD player/surround sound home theatre.
"
2,15,Stan,"Wow!
"
2,15,Sharon,"What do you say, Shelly?
"
2,15,Shelly,"Thank you, Aunt Flo.
"
2,15,Sharon,"Okay, Stanley. Your turn. 
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"Your very own fish.
"
2,15,Shelly,"What do you say, Stanley?
"
2,15,Stan,"I don't know. 
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"I think he likes you.  Come on Shelly. Let's hook up your home theater.
"
2,15,Shelly,"Okay. 
"
2,15,Sharon,"How do you like your fish, Stanley?
"
2,15,Stan,"I don't like it. It's spooky.
"
2,15,Sharon,"Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room.
"
2,15,Stan,"Do I have to?
"
2,15,Sharon,"Yes, you do!
"
2,15,Stan,"Damn it! 
"
2,15,Sharon,"Language!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Where have you been, dude?
"
2,15,Stan,"Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Aunt Flo?
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Here he comes.
"
2,15,Stan,"Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
"
2,15,Cartman,"Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!
"
2,15,Kyle,"You said you could get us money, Cartman!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Well, at least he's back to normal.
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
"
2,15,Kyle,"It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!
"
2,15,Stan,"Why do you keep saying ""hella,"" fatass?!
"
2,15,Cartman,"'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why.
"
2,15,Kyle,"That's not cool!
"
2,15,Cartman,"You guys are just hella jealous.
"
2,15,Randy,"Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
"
2,15,Stan,"Can you leave the light on, Dad?
"
2,15,Randy,"Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.
"
2,15,Stan,"I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
"
2,15,Randy,"Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. 
"
2,15,Stan,"Where did it go?  Huhhh. 
"
2,15,Kenny,"(Give me that-!) 
"
2,15,Mrs. McCormick,"Kenny ,
"
2,15,Kenny,"(Ow, mom!)
"
2,15,Mrs. McCormick,"You share that blanket with your brother! 
"
2,15,Stuart,"Who the hell could that be? 
"
2,15,Cartman,"Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions.  There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. 
"
2,15,Stuart,"Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?
"
2,15,Kenny,"(Uh huh)
"
2,15,Stan,"Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 
"
2,15,Sharon,"Stanley, settle down!
"
2,15,Stan,"Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"Is there a problem? 
"
2,15,Sharon,"Uhno problem, Aunt Flo.
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"Do you not like your goldfish?
"
2,15,Stan,"No!
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"I'm sorry. I'm a bad aunt. 
"
2,15,Sharon,"There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. 
"
2,15,Stan,"AAAAAAAAH! 
"
2,15,Sharon,"Stanley, what are you doing?!
"
2,15,Stan,"The fish!  But-.
"
2,15,Sharon,"Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up.  Go to sleep, Stanley! 
"
2,15,Stan,"WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
"
2,15,Sharon,"All right, Stanley. I have had enough o-  Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? 
"
2,15,Stan,"Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.
"
2,15,Sharon,"Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel.  Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body.  Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 
"
2,15,Stan,"You're not gonna get away with this! 
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"Sharon!
"
2,15,Sharon,"D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"Look at you, with your little shovel. Just like when you were twelve.
"
2,15,Stan,"Mom, what are you doing?
"
2,15,Sharon,"Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley.
"
2,15,Stan,"Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 
"
2,15,Sharon,"Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything.
"
2,15,Stan,"But MOM!
"
2,15,Sharon,"Sshh.Hush little baby, don't say a word. Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' birdIf that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard
"
2,15,Stan,"MMOOMM!
"
2,15,Sharon,"What is it, honey?  My baby's killed again!
"
2,15,Stan,"No, mom!
"
2,15,Sharon,"What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do??  I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. 
"
2,15,Kyle,"It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
"
2,15,Kenny,"(Uh huh!)
"
2,15,Cartman,"Well, where is it?  What the hell is that?!
"
2,15,Kenny,"(It's the only thing I could afford.)
"
2,15,Cartman,"It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
"
2,15,Stan,"I haven't been sleeping so well.
"
2,15,Cartman,"God, I hate you, Kenny.  I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! 
"
2,15,Kyle,"God, will you shut up?!
"
2,15,Stan,"Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
"
2,15,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
2,15,Stan,"Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
"
2,15,Kyle,"I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
"
2,15,Cartman,"No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?You guys are my best friendsThrough thick and thin, we've always been togetherWe're four of a kind, havin' fun all dayPallin' around and laughin' awayJust best friends, best friends are we.I love you guys. 
"
2,15,Kyle,"You seem tired, Stan.
"
2,15,Stan,"I haven't been sleeping well.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Why?
"
2,15,Stan,"My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Hoh, that sucks, dude.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
2,15,Cartman,"Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!
"
2,15,Stan,"What are you doing?!
"
2,15,Cartman,"What do you mean, what am I doing?! Im just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.
"
2,15,Kyle,"You can't be standing there, Cartman.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Why the hell not?!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Because you're standing over there! 
"
2,15,Cartman,"Aaah! Son of a bitch!
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"Wow, you don't see this every day.
"
2,15,Cartman,"I can't believe what I'm seeing.
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Dude, this is hella weird.
"
2,15,Sharon,"Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woowhat what a surprise. Wwhat can I do for you?
"
2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Well, there's been a report of a few missing people.
"
2,15,Sharon,"Is that so?
"
2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. 
"
2,15,Sharon,"I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.
"
2,15,Officer Barbrady,"No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?
"
2,15,Sharon,"Why would you wanna do that?
"
2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?  Well, this all looks in-  oh? Tennis anyone? 
"
2,15,Sharon,"Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
"
2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.
"
2,15,Chef,"Hello there, children! 
"
2,15,The Boys,"Hey, Chef.
"
2,15,Chef,"All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Uh, Chef?
"
2,15,Chef,"Or haaauuunted hash browns.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Chef.
"
2,15,Chef,"And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Chef.
"
2,15,Chef,"And a teeeeerrifying napkin!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Chef!
"
2,15,Chef,"What?!
"
2,15,Kyle,"We have problems!
"
2,15,Chef,"Well, what's the first problem?
"
2,15,Stan,"Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
"
2,15,Chef,"Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem?  Oh, nohoho.  Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!
"
2,15,Cartman,"...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too.
"
2,15,Chef,"Exactly what do you remember?
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car.
"
2,15,Chef,"Of course! That's it!
"
2,15,Stan,"What?
"
2,15,Chef,"Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!
"
2,15,Cartman,"He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Will you stop saying that word?!
"
2,15,Stan,"Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
"
2,15,Chef,"Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef.
"
2,15,Chef,"How do you mean?
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman. 
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
"
2,15,Stan,"Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Ey, sweet!  Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her.
"
2,15,Stan,"Cartman!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Dude, this is hella cool.
"
2,15,Stan,"Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"Nn-oh.  I got it from the pet store, Stanley.
"
2,15,Stan,"Do you remember what pet store?
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"Let's see. I believe it was called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store,"" just outside of town.
"
2,15,Stan,"Where?
"
2,15,Aunt Flo,"I know I have the address written down somewhere.  Let me look.
"
2,15,Stan,"That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Who's ""we""? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"I'll help you, Stan.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
"
2,15,Stan,"Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
"
2,15,Sharon,"Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo! 
"
2,15,Stan,"It was the fish! 
"
2,15,Sharon,"Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. 
"
2,15,Stan,"Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
"
2,15,Kyle,"There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 
"
2,15,Stan,"Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 
"
2,15,Kyle,"Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"Can do!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Screw you! 
"
2,15,Sharon,"It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh!  I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy! 
"
2,15,Stan,"Come on, we're running out of time. 
"
2,15,Randy,"Hey, why is the basement door locked? 
"
2,15,Officer Barbrady,"-crack corn and I don't careJimmy crack corn and I don't careMy master's gone awayJimmy crack corn and I don't care
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"I don't see any pet stores called ""Indian Burial Ground.""
"
2,15,Cartman,"Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
"
2,15,Announcer,"And now, back to the Terrance and Phillip Halloween Special.
"
2,15,Terrance,"(Fart)
"
2,15,Phillip,"That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance. 
"
2,15,Cartman,"Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny! 
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"What's so funny about that?
"
2,15,Kitty,"Meow.
"
2,15,Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!
"
2,15,Mr. Kitty,"Meow.
"
2,15,Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah. 
"
2,15,Cartman,"NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!!  Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude.
"
2,15,Sharon,"Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
"
2,15,Mrs. McCormick,"You saw him, didn't you?  You saw my boy. 
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah, my goldfish-.
"
2,15,Sharon,"Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.
"
2,15,Mrs. McCormick,"My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was.
"
2,15,Stan,"I know.
"
2,15,Mrs. McCormick,"You've gotta tell me what happened to him!  You have to know something!
"
2,15,Sharon,"Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!
"
2,15,Mrs. McCormick,"That's right, I'm a little drunk.  You'd be drunk, too, if you'd lost your boy.  My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh.
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"You guys, I found the pet store!
"
2,15,Stan,"Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
"
2,15,Sharon,"I believe you, sweetheart.  Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!
"
2,15,Clerk,"Can I help you boys?
"
2,15,Stan,"I wanna return a fish.
"
2,15,Clerk,"Damn it!
"
2,15,Kyle,"What?
"
2,15,Clerk,"That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it?  Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah, dude.
"
2,15,Clerk,"Damn it!  Just like all the other returns! 
"
2,15,Kyle,"Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?""
"
2,15,Clerk,"Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it.
"
2,15,Stan,"So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
"
2,15,Clerk,"Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Why?
"
2,15,Clerk,"Why? I don't know. I was drunk.
"
2,15,Stan,"We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
"
2,15,Clerk,"Well, that certainly would explain a lot.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Like what?
"
2,15,Clerk,"Well, like this.  I've been wondering what the hell this was.
"
2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then.
"
2,15,Randy,"Sharon?
"
2,15,Sharon,"Yyes, hon?
"
2,15,Randy,"There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
"
2,15,Sharon,"Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. 
"
2,15,Randy,"Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?
"
2,15,Sharon,"Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.
"
2,15,Randy,"What is it?
"
2,15,Sharon,"I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.
"
2,15,Randy,"Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?
"
2,15,Stan,"Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
"
2,15,Clerk,"I can't give you your money back.
"
2,15,Stan,"I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
"
2,15,Clerk,"No! I won't take it back!
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, ""Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe."" Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly , you're gonna take this fish back.
"
2,15,Clerk,"All right, you win.
"
2,15,Stan,"Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! 
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"And sir, can I make a suggestion?  Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace.
"
2,15,Kyle,"You kick ass, evil Cartman!
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah!
"
2,15,Kyle,"You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer. 
"
2,15,Clerk,"What the-? 
"
2,15,Evil Stan,"He was here! Cartman was just here!
"
2,15,Clerk,"Who are you?
"
2,15,Evil Kyle,"We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?
"
2,15,Clerk,"I don't know who you mean?
"
2,15,Evil Kyle,"Maybe this will jog your memory! 
"
2,15,Clerk,"No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
"
2,15,Stan,"I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever!
"
2,15,Stan,"You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella.""
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe. 
"
2,15,Kyle,"Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
"
2,15,Evil Cartman,"Let's use Kenny's squash.
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
"
2,15,Terrance,"Boo!
"
2,15,Phillip,"Aaaaagh!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Aw, man, this movie is hella scary. 
"
2,15,Evil Stan,"Aha! There you are, Cartman!
"
2,15,Cartman,"P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?
"
2,15,Evil Kyle,"We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
"
2,15,Evil Stan,"Hey! What's wrong with you, Cartman?
"
2,15,Cartman,"What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum.  I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
"
2,15,Evil Kyle,"Come on, Mr. Wholesome! We're taking you back to our universe!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Don't touch me! 
"
2,15,Evil Stan,"What the hell's goin' on?! Cartman never hits us!
"
2,15,Evil Kyle,"Hall right! Just stand there, Cartman! This gingerification gun will send you back to our universe!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!
"
2,15,Evil Stan,"Yes!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you. 
"

"
2,15,Kyle,"Oh no, dude!

"
2,15,Kyle,"Damn it!
"
2,15,Randy,"I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.
"
2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.
"
2,15,Randy,"Uuuh, do you want your pants back?
"
2,15,Officer Barbrady,"No. Just leave me with my dignity.  Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here.
"
2,16,Sharon,"The answer is ""no"", Stanley!
"
2,16,Stan,"But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
"
2,16,Sharon,"I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays.
"
2,16,Stan,"But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
"
2,16,Sharon,"I'll leave it up to your father.
"
2,16,Randy,"Eh, it's fine with me.
"
2,16,Sharon,"The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!
"
2,16,Stan,"I don't want your lame-ass supper!
"
2,16,Shelly,"Ew! You're gonna get it now.
"
2,16,Sharon,"Go to your room, Stanley! Right now! 
"
2,16,Stan,"Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 
"
2,16,Sheila,"It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.
"
2,16,Liane,"Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a biiig present, for no reason, except that I'm cool.
"
2,16,Kyle,"That's nice, Cartman.
"
2,16,Stuart,"Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?
"
2,16,Kenny,"(Okay.)
"
2,16,Stan,"Okay, let's go!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.
"
2,16,Stan,"'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!
"
2,16,Sheila,"Goodbye, bubbe! Be careful!
"
2,16,Stuart,"See you in a couple of days, son.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Shotgun! It's my car, I call it first: shotgun!  Kenny, I called it shotgun!  Dammit, Kenny, get in the back!  Hey, Kenny, there's a sale on orange jackets over there.  Look, Kenny, there's an elephant parade!  Ken-ny. Kenny, look. Look! Go get it! , Go get it!  ha ha ha, you poor piece of crap. 
"
2,16,Stan,"So, how far is it to Nebraska?
"
2,16,Liane,"Around six hours.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
"
2,16,Liane,"Well, I've got an idea. We could sing.
"
2,16,Stan,"Yeah. Or, we could not.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?
"
2,16,Liane,"Over the meadow and through the woods
"
2,16,Liane and Cartman,"To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow...
"
2,16,Liane and Cartman,"Over the meadow and through the woods
To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
"
2,16,Kyle,"Please stop.
"
2,16,Liane and Cartman,"Through white and drifted snow
"
2,16,Kyle,"Please stop!
"
2,16,Liane and Cartman,"Over the meadow and through the woods,
To Grandmother's house we go
"
2,16,Cartman,"Argh!
"
2,16,Liane,"Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy.
"
2,16,Cartman,"I guess, damn! 
"
2,16,Liane,"Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska. 
"
2,16,Stan,"This is Nebraska?
"
2,16,Kyle,"What's all that stuff?
"
2,16,Liane,"Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--
"
2,16,Cartman,"We don't care, Mom.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
"
2,16,Stan,"Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
"
2,16,Kyle,"I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap.
"
2,16,Kyle,"It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
"
2,16,Liane,"That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Cool!
"
2,16,Cartman,"How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.
"
2,16,Liane,"About another hour, hon.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so  I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!
"
2,16,Liane,"Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.
Over the meadow and through the woods
"
2,16,Liane and Cartman,"To Grandmother's house we go
"
2,16,Kyle,"Oh, God! 
"
2,16,Liane and Cartman,"The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow...
"
2,16,Cartman,"Over the meadow and through the woods...
"
2,16,Liane,"Here we are. 
"
2,16,Kyle,"Jesus Christ, finally!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Grandmagrandmagrandmagrandma! 
"
2,16,Man,"Oh, it's little Eric!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Hi, Grandpa!
"
2,16,Grandpa,"Look at how big you've gotten!
"
2,16,Grandma,"Hi, Eric. Grandma got you a present.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Sweet. What is it?
"
2,16,Grandma,"It's inside.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Yes! Move it! 
"
2,16,Liane,"Hello everyone. Happy Holidays!
"
2,16,Everyone,"Hello!
"
2,16,Liane,"These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky.
"
2,16,Uncle Stinky,"Nice to have you heuh.
"
2,16,Liane,"Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra , Fat Bob, Jimmy , and great-grandma Florence. 
"
2,16,Florence,"Come here, Eric. Give your great-grandma some huggies. 
"
2,16,Kyle,"Agghh!
"
2,16,Liane,"No, no, Florence, that's not Eric.
"
2,16,Florence,"Oh, which one is he, then?
"
2,16,Stan,"He's the fat one.
"
2,16,Grandma,"He's not fat, he's big-boned.
"
2,16,Cartman,"I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech.
"
2,16,Kyle,"That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
"
2,16,Stan,"Sick, dude.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?
"
2,16,Grandma,"Here you go, Eric. Hap-py Holidays! 
"
2,16,Cartman,"Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt! 
"
2,16,Grandma,"Yes. I thought that would look really good on you.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!
"
2,16,Grandpa,"Well, this is what the holidays are about. Family.
"
2,16,Stan,"Yeah, right!
"
2,16,Grandpa,"Well, what does your family do for the holidays, Stan?
"
2,16,Stan,"My family's dead! 
"
2,16,Liane,"Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Dude, your family died?
"
2,16,Stan,"They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
"
2,16,Kyle,"What?!
"
2,16,Cartman,"I can't believe I got a stupid shirt!  The holidays are bullcrap!
"
2,16,Liane,"Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? 
"
2,16,Kyle,"What is this??
"
2,16,Liane,"Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Sick, dude!
"
2,16,Liane,"Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Hi, cousin Elvin.
"
2,16,Elvin,"Sweet.
"
2,16,Grandpa,"Well, it certainly is nice we could all gather heuh for the holidays. Even Uncle Howard has joined us live via satellite from the state penitentiary. 
"
2,16,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! 
"
2,16,Grandma,"You look good, Howard.
"
2,16,Howard,"No I don't!
"
2,16,Liane,"Hi, Howard.
"
2,16,Stan,"Dude, is he here every year like this?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Yup!
"
2,16,Elvin,"Sweet.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Aaww!
"
2,16,Howard,"Come on, let's eat already! They gave me extra bread and water!
"
2,16,Grandma,"Where's your manners, Howard? We haven't even said grace yet. Mom, will you do the honors of saying grace?
"
2,16,Florence,"God-damn it, why the hell do I always have to say grace? If one more person asks me to say grace, I'll be like, ""Eh! I'm not saying grace! And if you ask me again, I'll kick you square  in the nuts!""
"
2,16,Cartman,"Amen. 
"
2,16,All,"Ah-men. 
"
2,16,Kyle,"Jesus, dude! 
"
2,16,Grandpa,"No, Jimmy, this is my pot pie!  No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Bad Jimmy!
"
2,16,Grandma,"No, Jimmy, that's Grandpa's pot pie! 
"
2,16,Stan,"Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
"
2,16,Kyle,"I know what you mean. 
"
2,16,Kyle,"Arrggh! 
"
2,16,Stan,"What, dude? 
"
2,16,Kyle,"Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
"
2,16,Stan,"Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Oh. Arrggh! 
"
2,16,Stan,"What was that?
"
2,16,Kyle,"I heard it, too.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Whatever it is, it's getting closer.  Ow! What the hell was that for!
"
2,16,Stan,"I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. 
"
2,16,Cartman,"Ow!
"
2,16,Kyle,"I wanted to make sure, too.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Yuhwell, you're not dreaming!  Ey! Cut the crap!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Dude, it's coming through the window! 
"
2,16,Cartman,"Uncle Howard!
"
2,16,Uncle Howard,"Oh. Hey, Eric. I didn't think anybody'd be down here.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?!
"
2,16,Stan,"We thought you were in jail.
"
2,16,Howard,"Yeah, well I'b I busted out. 
"
2,16,Cartman,"Wow, cool!
"
2,16,Howard,"Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Okay.
"
2,16,Howard,"If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.
"
2,16,Howard,"Come on up, it's okay.  Another inmate busted out with me. Don't worry, he's a good guy.
"
2,16,Inmate,"Oh, hi boys. I'm Charlie. Charlie Manson. 
"
2,16,Manson,"I can't wait to get out among the pigs  and raise some hell.
"
2,16,Howard,"All right, Chuck, but we gotta lay low for a while.
"
2,16,Manson,"When I stand up on the mountain and say, ""Do it!"", it gets done! And it it don't get done, then I'll move on it! And that's the last thing in the world you want me to do.
"
2,16,Howard,"All right, Chuck. Let's watch some TV or something. 
"
2,16,Announcer,"Now back to, ""It's A Wonderful Life"".
"
2,16,George Bailey,"You-oo you just can't buy people, Mr. Potter, wuh. Why, you know what you are? You're a little bitch.  That's right, you're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?
"
2,16,Stan,"Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
"
2,16,Cartman,"What?
"
2,16,Kyle,"We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
"
2,16,Cartman,"All right, keeps your pants on.
"
2,16,Howard,"Hey, bring us down some food, all right?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Okay. 
"
2,16,Stinky,"Come on, Team!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Can somebody drive us to the mall?
"
2,16,Announcer,"Touchdown!
"
2,16,The Adults,"Yeah!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?
"
2,16,Announcer,"And these Cornhuskers have the ball on the 50-yard line!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall?
"
2,16,Stinky,"Not now, Eric.  Hold him! He has him! Where's the flag?!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!
"
2,16,Stinky,"I said ""no,"" and I mean ""no!"" Respect my authorituh!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Damn his Goddamned authorituh!
"
2,16,Announcer,"With only 16 seconds left, the Cornhu-
"
2,16,Reporter,"We interrupt this broadcast for a news bulletin.
"
2,16,Stinky,"What?!
"
2,16,Reporter,"Mass murderer and extremely nasty person Charles Manson has escaped from prison! Manson was the man responsible for seven murders in the late '60's. Manson has never shown any signs of remorse for his crimes. If you see Manson, please kick his ass and smash his fucking face in for me, and then call the police. And now back to the game.
"
2,16,Announcer,"And they've done it! They've scored 16 unanswered points in 15 seconds! 
"
2,16,The Adults,"Oh, weak!
"
2,16,Grandma,"Eric, I need you to take care of your cousin Elvin for a while.
"
2,16,Cartman,"I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!
"
2,16,Grandma,"Won't yo do it for Grandma?
"
2,16,Cartman,"All right. Give me $10. 
"
2,16,Elvin,"Kick ass!
"
2,16,George Bailey,"Oh, Mary. Mary, you're real!
"
2,16,Howard,"Chuck, can you turn that thing down?
"
2,16,George Bailey,"Hello, movie house!  Hello, burger parlor!
"
2,16,Manson,"You know what the spirit of Christmas is? It's another lie, from the lyin' pigs that consider me the witness-!
"
2,16,Howard,"Okay, Chuck! Thank you very much!
"
2,16,Cartman,"My family sucks ass!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Yeah, they do!
"
2,16,Stan,"All families suck ass!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns. 
"
2,16,Howard,"Wow, sweet!
"
2,16,Manson,"Heyyy!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Dude, we have to get to the mall!!
"
2,16,Elvin,"You guys, seriously!
"
2,16,Howard,"What's the matter?
"
2,16,Cartman,"My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us.
"
2,16,Howard,"Oh, bummer.
"
2,16,Manson,"I'll take you! 
"
2,16,Howard,"Uh, that's okay, Chuck. You just keep watching Christmas specials.
"
2,16,Manson,"Hey, I didn't bust out of prison to be locked up in somebody's basement! I want some action!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Good for you, Charlie!
"
2,16,Manson,"Come on! I'll hot-wire your Grandpa's car!
"
2,16,Stan,"Do you really think we should go with this guy?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people. 
"
2,16,Manson,"All right, boys, keep your heads down!  We're goin' to the mall!
"
2,16,Boys,"Hooray!
"
2,16,Sharon,"I just can't believe he would go without our permission!
"
2,16,Randy,"Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something.
"
2,16,Sharon,"Well, I hope for his sake you're right. 
"
2,16,Liane,"Hello?
"
2,16,Sharon,"Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you?
"
2,16,Liane,"Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon.
"
2,16,Sharon,"Wwhat?!
"
2,16,Liane,"Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.
"
2,16,Sharon,"Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska!
"
2,16,Shelly,"Ooooo, Stan's in trouble!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Do you see him?
"
2,16,Stan,"Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
"
2,16,Kyle,"I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!
"
2,16,Kid,"I drove all the way from Montana to see Mr. Hankey.
"
2,16,Kyle,"That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
"
2,16,Cartman,"How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff. 
"
2,16,Elvin,"Mr. Hankey kicks ass!
"
2,16,Cartman,"And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!
"
2,16,Kyle,"So?!
"
2,16,Cartman,"So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?
"
2,16,Kyle,"Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 
"
2,16,Manson,"How would you like to come with me to a more secluded part of the mall?
"
2,16,Kenny,"(Okay) 
"
2,16,Stan,"I really like that guy.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin.  God damnit, be quiet, Elvin! Shut up, Elvin!  No, Elvin, bad Elvin! 
"
2,16,Manson,"Folks need to understand that I am terror! I am fear! I am-! Oh, hey look, another holiday special.
"
2,16,Voice-over,"And now, back to ""The Grinchy Poo"" 
"
2,16,Narrator,"Grinchy Poo went up the chimney and stuffed the tree up
But then he heard a coo, like the cry of a dove
It was little Cindy Lou Poo, who was no more than two
""Mr. Hankey, why? Why are you taking our Christmas tree, why?""
And Old Grinchy Poo thought of a line, and he thought it up quick...
"
2,16,Hankey Elf,"All right, boys, you're up next. Welcome to Mr. Hankey's Happy Lollyland! 
"
2,16,Kyle,"Hoh, boy. Here we go!
"
2,16,Mall Hankey,"Howdy ho, boys.
"
2,16,Stan,"Mr. Hankey? 
"
2,16,Mall Hankey,"Gosh, you boys smell like flowers.
"
2,16,Kyle,"You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
"
2,16,Mall Hankey,"Sure I am! Howdy ho!
"
2,16,Stan,"You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
"
2,16,Mall Hankey,"Well, Mr. Hankey has to grow too, you know. Howdy ho!
"
2,16,Hankey Elf,"You boys want your picture with Mr. Hankey?
"
2,16,Kyle,"This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 
"
2,16,Mall Hankey,"It's okay, kids. I'm real. Hoowwdy ho!
"
2,16,Kids,"Hoowwdy ho!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
"
2,16,Mall Hankey,"Look, kid. There's Mr. Hankeys like me in every shopping mall. There is no real Mr. Hankey.
"
2,16,Kyle,"What?! What did you say?!
"
2,16,Stan,"Oh, boy. You've done it now.
"
2,16,Mall Hankey,"Huh??
"
2,16,Kyle,"Behold! Here's your false prophet!
"
2,16,Kids,"Boo! 
"
2,16,Mall Hankey,"Oh!
"
2,16,Kids,"Die!
"
2,16,Mall Hankey,"Ow!
"
2,16,Kid 1,"Get out! 
"
2,16,Kids,"You son of a bitch! Rip it down! Get out!
"
2,16,Girl,"You lied to me, Mother. You said it was the real Mr. Hankey.
"
2,16,Mother,"Uhwwell, yes, but-
"
2,16,Girl,"I will not forget this, Mother. I will not forget this, ever. 
"
2,16,Kid,"This is revolution! 
"
2,16,Mall Hankey,"Wah-hahow!
"
2,16,Security Guard 1,"Uh oh, they're rioting again. 
"
2,16,Narrator,"And all the poos down in Pooville joined hands and they sang
They sang all the same
And he himself, the Grinchy Poo, carved the roast poo.
"
2,16,Manson,"Wow, man. That's beautiful. He was evil, but now he's good. 
"
2,16,Officer 1,"What's happening?
"
2,16,Officer 2,"Some kid must have said it wasn't the real Mr. Hankey again. 
"
2,16,Cartman,"I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap!
"
2,16,Manson,"Well, how was it?
"
2,16,Kyle,"It was a fake!
"
2,16,Manson,"Oh, I'm sorry.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
"
2,16,Stan,"Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?
"
2,16,Manson,"Uh, I went to a beauty parlor and had my tattoo redone.  Look!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Oh, uh that's pretty cool.
"
2,16,Stan,"Hey. Where's Kenny?
"
2,16,Manson,"Oh. He's... around.
"
2,16,Kenny,"(Hey, you guys. I'm right here.)
"
2,16,Stan,"Oh, hey Kenny.
"
2,16,Manson,"Come on, I'll buy you kids an orange Smoothie.
"
2,16,The Boys,"Ooooo!
"
2,16,Officer,"Hey, there he is! That's Charlie Manson! 
"
2,16,Manson,"Run for your lives, boys! 
"
2,16,Cartman,"Ugh! Wait! You guys. Seriously. 
"
2,16,Officer,"Come back here, God damnit!  He's getting away! 
"
2,16,Manson,"Keep your heads down, kids! 
"
2,16,Cartman,"Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
"
2,16,Kyle,"I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!
"
2,16,Announcer,"We interrupt this program for a breaking news story.
"
2,16,Reporter,"A high speed car chase is happening right now on interstate 3. We go now to our live sky-fi helicopter.
"
2,16,Sky-fi Reporter,"Ron, it looks as though the chase is proceeding west down the interstate.
"
2,16,Grandma,"Oh, that looks a lot like your car, Harold.
"
2,16,Sky-fi Reporter,"We understand that Charles Manson is inside the car with several hostages, all of whom are children  My God, what is this world coming to? Well, we'd like to take a moment to tell you that this car chase is being brought to you by Snacky S'mores , the creamy bonbon s'mores in a delightful cookie crunch.
"
2,16,Manson,"They're gaining on us! 
"
2,16,Officer,"Fudgecicle! 
"
2,16,Elvin,"Kickass! 
"
2,16,Kyle,"God, I hate the holiday season! 
"
2,16,Grandma,"Oh, hello kids. Having fun-?
"
2,16,Manson,"Get in the house!
"
2,16,Grandma,"Alrighty, then. 
"
2,16,Cartman,"Lock the door! 
"
2,16,Big Blonde,"Oh my God, it's Charlie Manson! Whoa!
"
2,16,Harold,"What's going on?
"
2,16,Stan,"There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
"
2,16,Stinky,"Quiet down, we're watching television. 
"
2,16,Terrance,"Oh, Phillip, what a precious gift! 
"
2,16,Phillip,"That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing. 
"
2,16,Howard,"The cops are here!
"
2,16,Grandma,"Howard!
"
2,16,Harold,"How did you get out, son?
"
2,16,Police Chief,"All right, Manson, we know you're in there! Come out peacefully, and we'll shoot you!
"
2,16,Officer,"Tell him we won't shoot him, Boss.
"
2,16,Police Chief,"Oh, yeah. That's a good idea.  Come out peacefully, and we won't shoot you! 
"
2,16,Grandma,"Oh, look. Police Chief Stevens got a new haircut.
"
2,16,Howard,"Get down, Ma!
"
2,16,Manson,"Hey, man, don't point a gun at your own mother!
"
2,16,Howard,"What the hell is wrong with you, Manson? You're acting all funny! Everybody just sit down and shut up! We're not going back to the big house!
"
2,16,Harold,"Well, Howard, you've done it again! You've ruined Christmas!
"
2,16,Field Reporter,"This is Robert Pooner reporting live from Nebraska, where escaped convict Charlie Manson has walled himself up in a house.  We understand that there are hostages, and that the situation is critical, , so we would like to remind you all that this live hostage crisis is being brought to you by Palmoral Sun Block . Remember, if it isn't Palmoral, you're gonna get cancer.
"
2,16,Sharon,"What's going on here?!
"
2,16,Chief Stevens,"We've got a critical situation, ma'am. Charlie Manson is holding everybody inside hostage.
"
2,16,Sharon,"Is this the Cartman residence?
"
2,16,Chief Stevens,"Yes, ma'am.
"
2,16,Sharon,"Give me that!  Stanley! This is your mother!
"
2,16,Stan,"Oh ooh.
"
2,16,Kyle,"What's your mom doing here, dude?
"
2,16,Sharon,"Young man, I have had it! You have disobeyed me for the last time! 
"
2,16,Howard,"Wow, she's really pissed.
"
2,16,Manson,"I'm glad I'm not you right now, kid.
"
2,16,Sharon,"What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!
"
2,16,Stan,"...Sorry.
"
2,16,Robert Pooner,"Still more developments in the Manson hostage crisis. Uh, it appears now that eight-year-old Stan Marsh  is in BIG, big trouble. He apparently disobeyed his parents, left home without telling them, and uh, Tom, his- his mother is very disappointed with him.
"
2,16,Howard,"Damn it! What are we gonna do?
"
2,16,Florence,"Sshhhh! We're watching television.
"
2,16,Phillip,"Waitwaitwaitwait. 
"
2,16,Terrance,"Check out this one.  
"
2,16,Phillip,"Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here. 
"
2,16,Terrance,"Okay, here I come, okay. 
"
2,16,Phillip,"Okay, waitwait waitwait. 
"
2,16,Chief Stevens,"Come out with your hands up!
"
2,16,Howard,"Damnit, Dad, why didn't you put a back door on this house?!
"
2,16,Harold,"Well, there's that old window in the bathroom; you could probably squeeze through there.
"
2,16,Howard,"That's it! We're going out the bathroom window! Come on, Manson!
"
2,16,Manson,"But I gotta see what happens.
"
2,16,Howard,"Come on, damn it!  Well, it's good seeing you all. Don't move until we're gone or I'll shoot you dead. Happy holidays.
"
2,16,The Adults,"Happy holidays. 
"
2,16,Stan,"Dude, they're gonna kill me.
"
2,16,Police Chief Stevens,"All right, Manson, this is it! We're coming in after you! There's gonna be a lo-o-ot of bloodshed, and a lot of innocent people are gonna die! You've got until 100-Marshmallow to come out!
"
2,16,Officer,"1-Marshmallow, 2-Marshmallow,...
"
2,16,Howard,"All right, it's open! Let's go!
"
2,16,Stan,"'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.
"
2,16,Manson,"Huh?!
"
2,16,Stan,"Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
"
2,16,Manson,"But Stan, your mother and father are out there!
"
2,16,Stan,"I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
"
2,16,Howard,"All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go. 
"
2,16,Manson,"Stan, I wanna talk to you about family. 
"
2,16,Stan,"What?!
"
2,16,Howard,"What?!
"
2,16,Manson,"You see, I had a family once. At least, I called them my family. Really, they were nothin' but a gang of people I thought were my friends. Ah after we killed a bunch of people together, I realized that my real family was who took care of me, and who took the time to care about what I did.
"
2,16,Stan,"But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
"
2,16,Manson,"If they don't care about you, would they have driven nine hours to Nebraska?
"
2,16,Stan,"I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks. 
"
2,16,Howard,"Now can we go??
"
2,16,Manson,"No, Howard. You go ahead. I've got something to say. 
"
2,16,Howard,"Oh, weak!
"
2,16,Manson,"Folks, I apologize for this whole mess. I'm going to surrender. Somebody show the police a white flag.
"
2,16,Officer,"90-Marshmallow, 91-Marshmallow  This is making me hungry for marshmallows  92-Marshmallow 
"
2,16,Chief Stevens,"Look out, he's got a white flag! 
"
2,16,Manson,"Oh my God, they killed the little orange-coat kid!
"
2,16,Kyle,"You bastards! 
"
2,16,Chief Stevens,"They're surrendering!
"
2,16,Cops,"Okay, grab a hold of him. You're under arrest, buddy. 
"
2,16,Blond Cop,"All right you, spread 'em! 
"
2,16,Chief Stevens,"You're going back to prison to rot, Manson!
"
2,16,Manson,"Good! I deserve to!
"
2,16,Chief Stevens,"What??
"
2,16,Manson,"I can never make it up to the families that I destroyed, but at least I'll make an example for anyone else thinking that crime  is an answer.
"
2,16,Chief Stevens,"Stop that. 
"
2,16,Manson,"You see, I get it now! I finally understand what the holidays are all about. Boys, don't you see? You can't let things get you down during the holidays, because being happy is what the holidays are all about!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
"
2,16,Manson,"I've been such a bastard all these years, and I finally understand. And it it it feels great! If I feel like- I feel like I'm in my own Christmas special. You see...
Holidays are that special time
When we laugh and sing and feel warm and cozy
Forget about being angry for a day 
Remember how it felt to be a child
Opening presents on Christmas mornin' 
That's the way that we should all feel now
So I say Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happy
Holidays
"
2,16,Everyone Else,"Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happyHolidays
"
2,16,Manson,"Happy Kwanzaa, too
From me to you
Happy Holidays, you guys.
"
2,16,Chief Stevens,"Happy Holidays, Bob.
"
2,16,Officer Bob,"Happy Holidays, Chief.
"
2,16,Chief Stevens,"Come on, Manson. You belong in jail. 
"
2,16,Manson,"You're darn right I do.
"
2,16,Howard,"Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and Dad. I hope you can forgive me.
"
2,16,Grandma,"Oh, of course we forgive you, son. It was nice of you to pop in for the holidays.
"
2,16,Grandpa,"Yes. Now, watch that ass in prison, son.
"
2,16,Howard,"I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help.
"
2,16,Cartman,"See ya, Uncle Howard.  Thanks for being such a great role model for me.  Piece of crap.
"
2,16,Stan,"I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
"
2,16,Sharon,"Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home.
"
2,16,Stan,"Really?
"
2,16,Randy,"Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.
"
2,16,Stan,"Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?
"
2,16,Robert Pooner,"And so, Manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell. Everything is back to normal, and I guess the only thing left to say is, God bless us, everyone.
"
2,16,Manson,"""And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. All I hope is that I don't make mankind lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers in the world. There's rapists and thieves. But those are the vast minority. The majority of mankind is made up of caring people, who try every day to do what they think is right. And that's the spirit of the season."" What do you think, guys?
"
2,16,Inmate,"It sucks, just like all your other books. 
"
2,16,Manson,"Well, Guh Good night, you guys. Happy Holidays.
"
2,16,Inmate,"Shut up! 
"
2,16,Manson,"What was that?  What the?! 
"
2,16,Cartmans/Boys,"Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson! 
""Hark,"" the herald angels sin,
""Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth, and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled""
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
""Hark,"" the herald angels sing
"
2,16,Stan,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad.  The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There's a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again.  Yes, Stanley?
"
2,17,Stan,"That's okay with us.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
2,17,Kid,"Yeah, we don't care.
"
2,17,Cartman,"Yeah, that's fine.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"No it isn't, it makes you very sad! Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board.
"
2,17,Class,"Aawwww! 
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"""Current Events in South Park"". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on.
"
2,17,Class,"Aawwww! 
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Token , you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek.
"
2,17,Tweek,"AAAghah heheh.
"
2,17,Stan,"Oh, not Tweek.
"
2,17,Kyle,"We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
"
2,17,Tweek,"I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!
"
2,17,Stan,"Dude, we can't work with this kid.
"
2,17,Tweek,"Yuh-ugh!
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought. ""Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?"" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see? 
"
2,17,Stan,"No.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!
"
2,17,Tweek,"Wagh!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Hello there, customer.
"
2,17,Customer,"Hello. How are you today?
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee? 
"
2,17,Customer,"I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation...
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling.
"
2,17,Postum,"That's right. How come you don't call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, forget it, my my store is not for sale.
"
2,17,Postum,"My company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer.  This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested?
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me.
"
2,17,Postum,"Well, all right.  How about $500,000?
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"The answer is still no, Mr. Postum. You see, when my father opened this store 30 years ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee.  Sure, we may take a little longer to brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy names, but I guess we just care a little more.  And that's why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America.
"
2,17,Postum,"Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"But that could put me out of business.
"
2,17,Postum,"Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it! 
"
2,17,Barbrady,"Hello, Mr. Tweek.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Hi, Officer Barbrady.
"
2,17,Barbrady,"Who was that?
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you.
"
2,17,Barbrady,"The usual.  Ogh. Thanks. See you tomorrow.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Bye-bye. 
"
2,17,Stan,"Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
"
2,17,Tweek,"AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn. Aaarrrhaharn.
"
2,17,Stan,"Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
"
2,17,Cartman,"How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.
"
2,17,Kyle,"No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
"
2,17,Tweek,"Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!
"
2,17,Stan,"Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
"
2,17,Tweek,"The gnomes!
"
2,17,Stan,"What?
"
2,17,Tweek,"We can do our report on the gnomes.
"
2,17,Stan,"What gnomes?
"
2,17,Tweek,"The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants. 
"
2,17,Cartman,"Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.
"
2,17,Tweek,"They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
"
2,17,Tweek,"No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money.
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"Some things are more important than money.  The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip. 
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"Oh, hello, son. How was your day?
"
2,17,Tweek,"UUuuUunh!
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweek,"That's good. Who are your little friends?
"
2,17,Tweek,"What do you mean?!
"
2,17,Kyle,"We're his oral report buddies.
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later. 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm.
"
2,17,Stan,"'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses.
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"Richard!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery.
"
2,17,Tweek,"Mwaaah! Slavery?
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Yes, slavery.
"
2,17,Stan,"Wow, that sucks, dude.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"They really have my balls in a salad shooter.
"
2,17,Kyle,"We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeah.
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you lose them, not because of underpants gnomes.
"
2,17,Tweek,"Uunnnnhh!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject.
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Man, this stuff is strong.
"
2,17,Stan,"Kind of bitter.
"
2,17,Tweek,"What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?
"
2,17,Kyle,"Don't worry about it.
"
2,17,Tweek,"But we'll starve and die like dogs.
"
2,17,Cartman,"Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?
"
2,17,Kenny,"(Fuck you!)
"
2,17,Cartman,"Heheh, you suck, Kenny.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
"
2,17,Stan,"Aooooo!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Woohoo! 
"
2,17,Kenny,"(Let me try! Let me try!)
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeess, this stuff rocks!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!
"
2,17,Stan,"Whoopee!
"
2,17,Kenny,"(Look at me! Look at me!)
"
2,17,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
"
2,17,Tweek,"I just have grounds.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Killer!! 
"
2,17,Cartman,"Ey, let me have some grounds. 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Hogh, my stomach hurts.
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
"
2,17,Tweek,"Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!
"
2,17,Stan,"Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"How's the report going, boys?
"
2,17,Stan,"Bad!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, do you need some more coffee?
"
2,17,Boys,"Eugh.
"
2,17,Cartman,"No...more...coffee. Blech. 
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Well, boys, uh. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you.
"
2,17,All,"You did?!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don't have to use it.
"
2,17,Stan,"No, we'll use it.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"All right.  And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right? 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Sure. 
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Now, when you give the report,  just make sure that you read this part first, okay? 
"
2,17,Tweek,"There they are!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"And when you come up to do it a second time, really, really clear it up, I mean, um, really, really play the sympathy angle. They'll like that. They'll be calling you, and you'll get a passing grade for it.
"
2,17,Tweek,"You guys, look! Look! You're missing it!
"
2,17,Tweek,"Arrgghh! They took them again!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Thanks, dude.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"My pleasure. G'night, boys. 
"
2,17,Stan,"Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!
"
2,17,Tweek,"Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
"
2,17,Tweek,"They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!
"
2,17,Kyle,"""And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
"
2,17,Cartman,"What will become of the endeavoring American family?""
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat.
"
2,17,Stan,"Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
"
2,17,Tweek,"Uurrgh!
"
2,17,Kyle,"And that's our report, I guess.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Well, boys, it's obvious you didn't even--
"
2,17,Lady Member,"Great job!
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Yes, great job.
"
2,17,Lady Member,"Boys, you have really opened our eyes. We didn't even know this was happening.
"
2,17,Cartman,"Neither did we.
"
2,17,Lady Member,"Well, Mr. Garrison, it looks like we were wrong about you. You really are teaching these kids something.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so.
"
2,17,Lady Member,"Aw, I am really moved. I say we follow these boys's cause. Let's join them in the fight against corporate takeovers!  Lead the way, boys!
"
2,17,Stan,"Huh??
"
2,17,Tweek,"Uunh, it's too much pressure!
"
2,17,Postum,"Good! Good! Now, make sure that sign is really bright and flashy now.
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"My goodness. That's going to be a huge coffee house, honey.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Yes, it is.  They really have my balls in a juice maker.  Oh, hello, son, uh. How did your report go?
"
2,17,Tweek,"Waagh!
"
2,17,Kyle,"I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Really?? Well, son, you might have just saved the family business. What do you have to say about that?
"
2,17,Tweek,"I need coffee.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"I know how you boys feel.  Sometimes a hot cup of French Roast Amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day. That smooth aroma and mild taste is what make Tweek coffee...  uh very special. Special, like an Arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew. A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt-- .
"
2,17,Tweek,"Dad!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"What?
"
2,17,Tweek,"The metaphors, man!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, sorry. Here you go. 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"Liike, how do you mean?
"
2,17,Kyle,"Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
"
2,17,Tweek,"Agghh!
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"Oh, that. He has ADD, attention deficit disorder. That's why he's so jittery all the time. 
"
2,17,Lady Member,"Mr. Tweek, we've only just heard.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, hello committee members. What a surprise.
"
2,17,Lady Member,"So, this is the corporate bulldozer trying to push you off the map. 
"
2,17,Mr. Tweek,"Yes. How did you hear?
"
2,17,Lady Member 2,"These boys did an excellent report for us this morning. They're so upset by this whole thing
"
2,17,Kyle,"My butt hurts.
"
2,17,Lady Member,"Don't worry, Mr. Tweek. This committee is not going to let you be run out of business by these bastards! Do you hear that? You're not gonna get away with this, you whore!
"
2,17,Postum,"Excuse me?!
"
2,17,Lady Member 2,"Boys, we've talked it over, and we want you to take your case to the mayor!
"
2,17,Stan,"Our case?
"
2,17,Tweek,"Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, you'll do fine, son.
"
2,17,Lady Member 2,"Come on, boys! Let's go!
"
2,17,Cartman,"Aw, man, this sucks! 
"
2,17,Tweek,"Aaarrrnnn!
"
2,17,Lady Member,"...And we would have never even known that this was happening if not for these boys' excellent report.
"
2,17,Mayor,"You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?
"
2,17,Lady Member,"That's right. 
"
2,17,Mayor,"Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet?
"
2,17,Lady Member,"Yes!
"
2,17,Mayor,"Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I-
"
2,17,Lady Member,"Mayor, these boys want that Harbucks coffee shut down right now!
"
2,17,Male Member,"Yeah!
"
2,17,Lady Member 2,"Hyeah!
"
2,17,Mayor,"Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country.
"
2,17,Lady Member,"But they're ruining our city!
"
2,17,Mayor,"Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do.
"
2,17,Blond Member,"Hooray!
"
2,17,The Other Members,"Hooray!
"
2,17,Lady Member,"What do you say, boys? We're gonna pass a law!
"
2,17,Stan,"Uh... Hooray.
"
2,17,Mayor,"So I guess you wanna do some campaigning.  You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up...
"
2,17,Tweek,"Wagh!
"
2,17,Mayor,"...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you. 
"
2,17,Tweek,"Didn't you see them!?
"
2,17,Mayor,"All right, what's next.
"
2,17,Ted,"Next is issue 37D, missing underpants. 
"
2,17,Johnson,"Is it cold in here?
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you.  Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's really horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys.
"
2,17,Tweek,"Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
"
2,17,Tweek,"Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
"
2,17,Host,"Live, it's the South Park Town Hall Meeting on Public Access. Tonight's topic: Prop. 10. 
"
2,17,Mediator,"Should Harbucks be allowed to open a store in South Park? That's tonight's topic. On my left, five innocent, starry-eyed boys from Middle America.  On my right, a big, fat, smelly corporate guy from New York.
"
2,17,Audience,"Boo!
"
2,17,Postum,"Hey, I'm not fat or smelly!
"
2,17,Mediator,"All right, Mr. Douchebag.
"
2,17,Postum,"Postum!
"
2,17,Mediator,"Oh. Pardon me, Mr. Assface. Anyway, let's hear your side of the argument.
"
2,17,Audience,"Boo!
"
2,17,Postum,"My argument is simple. This country's founded on free enterprise. Harbucks is an organization that--
"
2,17,Audience,"Hhssssssss!
"
2,17,Postem,"An organization that prides itself on great coffee! We simply want tuh-- Oh, to hell with you!
"
2,17,Mediator,"Okay, ucka-fay. Now for the other side of the argument we turn to our young, handsome lads.  Boys, your thoughts.  Come on, boys, don't be shy. What's your principal argument? 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Uh...
"
2,17,Stan,"Uh...
"
2,17,Cartman,"This guy sucks ass!
"
2,17,Audience,"Yeah! Yeah! Woo!
"
2,17,Mediator,"Great argument! You win, boys!
"
2,17,Postum,"What?!
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"That was close, Mr. Hat.
"
2,17,Voice-over,"What is the future of America? Is it the money we make?  The quests we conquer?  No, it's children.  So what do children have to say about Prop. 10?
"
2,17,Kyle,"I don't like big corporations.
"
2,17,Stan,"I like small businesses.
"
2,17,Cartman,"I believe in the family-owned enterprise.
"
2,17,Kenny,"(In my family, it's a silly enterprise.)
"
2,17,Tweek,"Aarrgghh!
"
2,17,Voice-over,"It's time to stop large corporations. Prop. 10 is about children. Vote Yes on Prop. 10, or else, you hate children. You don't hate... children... do you? Remember, keep American business small, or else.  Paid for by Citizens for a Fair and Equal way to get Harbucks Coffee kicked out of town forever. 
"
2,17,Lady Member,"Well, what do you think?
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Wow, it it's great!
"
2,17,Lady Member,"Yes it is. We'll put it on the air immediately.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"What do you think, hon?  Hon? What's the matter? 
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"I have a big problem with this.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"What do you mean?
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"We are just using those boys for our benefit. They have no idea what they're saying.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"But, kids are great to get people on our side.
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"You don't just throw a child in a political commercial to sell your beliefs. I won't be a part of this anymore. 
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Honey, all's fair in love and war.  And coffee. Hon? Hu-hon?
"
2,17,Lady Protester,"Take your corporate coffee and go back to New York City!
"
2,17,Crowd,"Yeah!!
"
2,17,Blonde Protester,"It's people like you who are ruining Main Street, USA! 
"
2,17,Crowd,"That's right! Yeah!
"
2,17,Lady Protester,"How many Native Americans did you slaughter to make that coffee, huh?!
"
2,17,Crowd,"Yeah!!
"
2,17,Postum,"Damn, these people aren't buying any coffee! I'll have to try and appeal to the younger crowd.
"
2,17,Postum,"Hey, kids. I'm Camel Joe and I love a fresh cup of coffee. It's yum diddly-icious, and it makes you feel super!  I have a surprise for you: the new Kiddicino from Harbucks; more sugar and all the other goodies kids like with all the caffeine of a normal double latte. 
"
2,17,Kid's Mom,"No Billy, no coffee for you.  You should be ashamed of yourself, using cartoons to push caffeine on children!
"
2,17,Postum,"Why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out from, lady?!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Uh, Mr. Postum, I'm afraid you've got a lot to learn about making coffee.
"
2,17,Postum,"Oh, and you don't? Your coffee tastes like three-day-old moldy diarrhea!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Uh I'm sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow, and if the law passes, you're gonna be thrown out of town.
"
2,17,Postum,"What?!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"At five o'clock, the best coffee wins. Either your coffee, or a fresh, warm cup of... Tweek's coffee.  Like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age, you can count on Tweek's coffee to start your day. 
"
2,17,Mayor,"Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like...
"
2,17,Johnson,"Toto.
"
2,17,Mayor,"Like Toto. And then the Harbuck's guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work.
"
2,17,Cartman,"What now?
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Oh, God, when is this gonna end?
"
2,17,Stan,"Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!
"
2,17,Tweek,"Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!
"
2,17,Kyle,"So what are we gonna say?
"
2,17,Cartman,"Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?
"
2,17,Stan,"'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Does anybody know anything about corporations? 
"
2,17,Tweek,"Waagh!
"
2,17,Cartman,"I think my mom is a corporation.
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeah, that makes sense.
"
2,17,Tweek,"You guys! Sshhhh! 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Well, how about we just say, ""corporates should be stopped""?
"
2,17,Stan,"How do we stretch that into five minutes?
"
2,17,Tweek,"They're taking my underpants!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  
"
2,17,Tweek,"Aaaggghhh! 
"
2,17,Stan,"What the hell? 
"
2,17,Cartman,"Well, I'll be damned.
"
2,17,Tweek,"That's my last pair of underpants! 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Sshh, don't scare him.
"
2,17,Stan,"Hey there, little guy.
"
2,17,Cartman,"Bad! 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
2,17,Cartman,"What?!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
"
2,17,Cartman,"Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him. 
"
2,17,Gnome,"Is that all you've got, pussy?
"
2,17,Cartman,"What?! 
"
2,17,Stan,"Hey, he talks!
"
2,17,Cartman,"Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!
"
2,17,Gnome,"You're a pussy, pussy!
"
2,17,Cartman,"Ey!
"
2,17,Stan,"Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?
"
2,17,Kyle,"Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.
"
2,17,Tweek,"Waggh.
"
2,17,Gnome,"Stealing underpants big business.
"
2,17,Stan,"Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
"
2,17,Gnome,"Sure, that's what gnomes do.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Show us.
"
2,17,Gnome,"O-kay. Follow me. 
"
2,17,Cartman,"Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome.
"
2,17,Gnome,"Not much longer now.
"
2,17,Cartman,"Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?
"
2,17,Gnome,"No, pussy, I'm taking you to my village.
"
2,17,Cartman,"Oh, your pussy village?
"
2,17,Stan,"Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
"
2,17,Gnome,"Follow me.
"
2,17,Cartman,"I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.
"
2,17,Postum,"Well, it looks like Harbucks will never make it in this town.  All right, boys, that's it. Pack it up, we're movin' out of town.
"
2,17,Worker 1,"Aw, but we just finished.
"
2,17,Postum,"I know, but these folks obviously don't want us here.
"
2,17,Worker 2,"But what will become of us?
"
2,17,Postum,"Oh, quit being so melodramatic, Sanchez. Jesus Christ!
"
2,17,Stan,"Damn, dude, this place is huge! 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
"
2,17,Cartman,"No it isn't, you guys!
"
2,17,Gnome,"This is where all our work is done.
"
2,17,Cartman,"So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?
"
2,17,Gnome,"Collecting underpants is just phase 1. Phase 1: collect underpants.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Sooo, what's phase 2?
"
2,17,Gnome,"Hey, what's phase 2?
"
2,17,Gnome 2,"Phase 1: we collect underpants.
"
2,17,Gnome,"Yeah yeah yeah, but, what about phase 2?
"
2,17,Gnome 2,"Well, phase 3 is profit. Get it?
"
2,17,Stan,"I don't get it.
"
2,17,Gnome 2,"You see,Phase 1: collect underpants. Phase 2: ... Phase 3: Profit.
"
2,17,Cartman,"Oh, I get it.
"
2,17,Stan,"No you don't, fatass!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Do you guys know anything about corporations?
"
2,17,Gnome,"You bet we do!
"
2,17,Gnome 2,"Us gnomes are geniuses at corporations.
"
2,17,Gnomes,"Time to go to work, work all nightSe--
"
2,17,Center Gnome,"Jesus Christ, look out! 
"
2,17,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
2,17,Kyle,"You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
"
2,17,Gnome,"Holy shit! We've killed your friend!
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
"
2,17,Gnome 2,"Christ, we squished him like a bug!
"
2,17,Stan,"Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
"
2,17,Gnome,"Well, we can explain that to you easily.
"
2,17,Gnome 2,"Yes, for a price.
"
2,17,Kyle,"What?
"
2,17,Gnome,"You know.
"
2,17,Stan,"Underpants?
"
2,17,Gnomes,"Underpants!
"
2,17,Lady Member,"Toto, ladies and gentlemen! 
"
2,17,Prop. 10 Supporter,"Yeah, Toto! Whoo, Toto! Woo!
"
2,17,Lady Member,"All right. And now, before we all vote yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why are the lovable, innocent children.
"
2,17,Stan,"Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
"
2,17,Supporter,"Underpants gnomes?
"
2,17,Kyle,"Big corporations are good!
"
2,17,Supporter,"What?
"
2,17,Supporter 2,"What's this?
"
2,17,Supporter 3,"Good? 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
"
2,17,Stan,"Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 
"
2,17,Townsman,"Ogh.
"
2,17,Lady Member,"That's not what you said last time.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!! 
"
2,17,Mrs. Tweak,"These boys are absolutely right. We've been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause, and it's wrong. We're as low and despicable as Rob Reiner. You keep protesting and complaining, but did any of you ever even bother to taste Harbucks coffee?  Harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best. Don't you think you should at least try it? 
"
2,17,Townsman,"Hey, this is pretty damn good.
"
2,17,Townsman 2,"Yeah, it doesn't have that bland, raw, sewage taste that Tweek's coffee has.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Hey. Hey, that is good.
"
2,17,Postum,"It's a French roast.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that first splash of sun on an April  morning. This coffee is coffee the way it should be.
"
2,17,Postum,"Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You know, we still need someone to run this Harbucks coffeehouse. I'm sure it will make a lot of money.
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Thank you, Mr. Postum, but I think we'll be happy with the money we make selling our son into slavery.
"
2,17,Tweek,"Aggghhh!
"
2,17,Richard Tweak,"Just kidding, son. 
"
2,17,Cartman,"I love you guys. 
"
2,18,Aussie,"As we steer our boat down , looking for these dangerous predators... Boy, there's a king croc right here.  He must be four meters; 12, 13 feet long at least.  This croc has enough power in its jaws to rip my head right off.
"
2,18,Kenny,"(Oh, no!) 
"
2,18,Aussie,"I've got to be careful. So, what I'm gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my thumb in its butthole.
"
2,18,Stan,"Holy crap. dude!
"
2,18,Aussie,"If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital: I'd better be real careful jamming my thumb in its butthole.  Oh, boy, it's pissed off now.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Go, dude, go! 
"
2,18,Aussie,"I'm gonna jam my thumb it its butthole now! This should really piss it off!  Oh, yeah, that pissed it off, all right!  I've gotta be careful!
"
2,18,Stan,"This guy rules!
"
2,18,Kenny,"(He actually killed it!)
"
2,18,Cartman,"I told you guys.
"
2,18,Aussie,"Well! That was quite an angry croc! But I managed to escape with only a few bruises and a shattered left testicle. Next week we'll look for more of these beautiful creatures, so we can learn more about them by pissing them off immensely. Thanks for watching.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
"
2,18,Stan,"Yeah! 
"
2,18,Cartman,"There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!
"
2,18,Kyle,"That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
"
2,18,Cartman,"Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Get away from me, Cartman! 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Come 'ere, crocky.
"
2,18,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAA! 
"
2,18,Stan,"Dude!
"
2,18,Kyle,"HELP! 
"
2,18,Stan,"Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!
"
2,18,Kenny,"(You bastard!)
"
2,18,Cartman,"Well, he shouldn't have called me fat. 
"
2,18,Stan,"Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
"
2,18,Cartman,"Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles! 
"
2,18,Kyle,"You guuuys!
"
2,18,Stan,"Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, you okay? 
"
2,18,Kyle,"I think so. Is Cartman up there?
"
2,18,Cartman,"I'm right here, Kyle.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!
"
2,18,Stan,"Can you climb back up, dude?
"
2,18,Kyle,"I don't think so.
"
2,18,Stan,"Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.
"
2,18,Stan,"Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Sick, dude! 
"
2,18,Stan,"Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Screw you, hippie!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
"
2,18,Stan,"All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 
"
2,18,Both,"AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Dude, it's a dude! 
"
2,18,Stan,"He's like, some frozen guy.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!
"
2,18,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Wow. Cool.
"
2,18,Stan,"You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
"
2,18,Cartman,"Really?  Hey, there's a frozen guy down there.
"
2,18,Stan,"Help me chip some of the ice away.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about ""Greased Lightning.""  You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-
"
2,18,Stan and Kyle,"Cartman, will you shut the hell up and get some more rope?!
"
2,18,Cartman,"Aww, screw you guys anyway!
"
2,18,Stan,"Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
"
2,18,Kyle,"Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
"
2,18,Both,"Hooray!
"
2,18,Cartman,"For what?
"
2,18,Stan,"Where shall we bring it?
"
2,18,Kyle,"I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
"
2,18,Stan,"I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
"
2,18,Kyle,"No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
"
2,18,Stan,"Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 
"
2,18,Kyle,"It's my name, and I found him.
"
2,18,Stan,"You didn't find him, I found him.
"
2,18,Kyle,"What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
"
2,18,Stan,"You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Kenny, who found the ice man?
"
2,18,Kenny,"(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve)
"
2,18,Cartman,"I think we're almost there, you guys.
"
2,18,Mayor,"Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say ""yippee.""
"
2,18,Some People,"Yippee.
"
2,18,Tardy Man,"Wait, what was that? I missed the question. Yippee! 
"
2,18,Mayor,"All those opposed, say ""nay.""
"
2,18,Other People,"Nay.
"
2,18,Tardy Man,"Screw you! 
"
2,18,Man,"Ey! Screw you! 
"
2,18,Stan,"Huh, excuse me?
"
2,18,Mayor,"Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment. 
"
2,18,Kyle,"But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 
"
2,18,Stan,"I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
"
2,18,Kyle,"No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
"
2,18,Mayor,"What the hell is going on here?
"
2,18,Kyle,"We came for our reward.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.
"
2,18,Mayor,"Reward? What reward?
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link  in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time.
"
2,18,Mayor,"Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him.
"
2,18,Stan,"Really.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Sweet. How about Steve?
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Steve it is.
"
2,18,Stan,"Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Come on, Steve. We've got work to do.  Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era.  Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer since... 1996!  This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away. 
"
2,18,Barbrady,"Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here.
"
2,18,Reporter,"What about the prehistoric ice man?
"
2,18,Barbrady,"Oh, yeah. There is that. 
"
2,18,Reporter,"Dr. Mephesto, could you please tell us what's going on?
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do.  But it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months!  Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes.
"
2,18,Reporter,"Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say:
"
2,18,Kyle,"Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 
"
2,18,Reporter,"The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurassic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Ugh? What's this?
"
2,18,Mayor,"Holy crap! He's alive??
"
2,18,Mephesto,"That's impossible!  Do an EKG on him! 
"
2,18,Mephesto,"My God, he really is alive. The ice must have preserved him!
"
2,18,Mayor,"Well, quick, do something!
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Nono, we've got to think this through.  Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused!
"
2,18,Mayor,"Well, you just can't let him die.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak!
"
2,18,Reporter 1,"What?
"
2,18,Reporter 2,"What's he saying?
"
2,18,Reporter 3,"Is that English?
"
2,18,Mephesto,"What? You're, you're hungry?
"
2,18,Mephesto,"You're, you're hungry?
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to. Mah-phehs-to.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers.  If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind like... a child.
"
2,18,Stan,"Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Gorak's a gay name.
"
2,18,Stan,"No, it isn't!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Why are you being such a dick?
"
2,18,Stan,"I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Nuh-uh!
"
2,18,Barbrady,"Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man.
"
2,18,Kyle,"I'll go.
"
2,18,Stan,"No, I'll go! I found him!
"
2,18,Cartman,"Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!
"
2,18,Barbrady,"All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes.  My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out? 
"
2,18,Kenny,"(Blue.)
"
2,18,Barbrady,"B L O O uh oh-O spells ""blue"" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown. 
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Steve. You-
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Steeve. Steeeve. Steeeve.  Oh good, you're here.
"
2,18,Stan,"Oh my God, they revived Gorak.
"
2,18,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying. 
"
2,18,Stan,"Uh. Hi.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"What'd he say?
"
2,18,Stan,"He said, ""hi.""
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Very interesting.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"What??
"
2,18,Stan,"He wants to know where he is.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Tell him, tell him he's... home.
"
2,18,Stan,"You're... home. 
"
2,18,Mephesto,"In the year 1999.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"He's been frozen for the last 32 months.
"
2,18,Stan,"Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"And we found you-
"
2,18,Mephesto,"All right, all right, all-
"
2,18,Mephesto,"All right, all right, calm down.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"I think that's enough for today. 
"
2,18,Kyle,"Good job, dude! You freaked him out!
"
2,18,Stan,"Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
"
2,18,Kyle,"Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
"
2,18,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
2,18,Stan,"Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
"
2,18,Cartman,"Killer.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Fine! 
"
2,18,Stan,"Fine! 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Fine.
"
2,18,Agent,"Are you Alphonse Mephesto?
"
2,18,Mephesto,"The same.
"
2,18,Agent,"We understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"That's right.
"
2,18,Agent,"We would like to...  we would like to offer our services in your experiments.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Oh? Where are you gents from?
"
2,18,Agent 2,"We are from the University, of... America.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Well, there's not a lot to see, but... Come in.  He's still not responding much to us; the shock is still settling in,  but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat.
"
2,18,Agent,"Habitat?
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat for Steve to live in that is completely like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented. 
"
2,18,Agent,"Amazing. He looks so much like us. 
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing: 
"
2,18,Agent,"Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific study is expensive. We want to help you make this project more... lucrative.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"How would we do that?
"
2,18,Agent,"It's easy.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers. 
"
2,18,Stan,"He doesn't look very happy in there.
"
2,18,Kyle,"No, he sure doesn't.
"
2,18,Stan,"I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!
"
2,18,Cartman,"Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him.  It's okay, he can't hurt you.  It's one-way glass: he can't even see us.  And now the ice man watches television. 
"
2,18,Aussie,"This grizzly bear has the strength of over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really pissing him off right now.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Wait. This could be dangerous.
"
2,18,Agent,"How so?
"
2,18,Mepehsto,"He's changing the channel. Something on the television could frighten and confuse him.
"
2,18,Sports Reporter,"And they've done it! The Atlanta Falcons are going to the Super Bowl!
"
2,18,Stan,"You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
"
2,18,Kyle,"He's my creature!
"
2,18,Mephesto,"He's fine, boys. And we're learning so much from him.
"
2,18,Stan,"Let him out, dude. He's scared.
"
2,18,Agent,"He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now?
"
2,18,Kyle,"But it isn't right!
"
2,18,Agent 2,"Little boy, sometimes, what's right isn't as important as what's profitable. 
"
2,18,Kenny,"(Uh oh. Ow!) 
"
2,18,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! 
"
2,18,Kyle,"What?! I'm not talking to you! 
"
2,18,Stan,"Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?
"
2,18,Stan,"I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
"
2,18,Stan,"What are you doing here?
"
2,18,Kyle,"I'm here to bust out Steve.
"
2,18,Stan,"What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
"
2,18,Kyle,"His name is Steve!
"
2,18,Stan,"His name is Gorak!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Steve!
"
2,18,Stan,"Gorak!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Steve!
"
2,18,Stan,"What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man
"
2,18,Stan,"No he doesn't!!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Does so!
"
2,18,Larry,"Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?
"
2,18,Stan,"I found him, I'm rescuing him! 
"
2,18,Larry,"Thanks. 
"
2,18,Stan,"You're a dick!
"
2,18,Kyle,"You're a dick!
"
2,18,Stan,"You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
"
2,18,Kyle,"You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
"
2,18,Stan,"Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?
"
2,18,Stan,"Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 
"
2,18,Stan,"I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 
"
2,18,Marilyn Manson,"I just smelled your britches and they're stinky
Stinky Britches
Stinky Britches
"
2,18,Larry,"Arrrggh! 
"
2,18,Mephesto,"He's gone! The ice man has broken out!
"
2,18,Agent,"No, that's impossible! How could he have?
"
2,18,Mephesto,"He must have used this... door 
"
2,18,Agent,"Damn it, Damn it!
"
2,18,Mephesto,"We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world!
"
2,18,Agent,"Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't be able to use him for our military war-
"
2,18,Agent 2,"Sshhhh!
"
2,18,Agent,"Right.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"What?
"
2,18,Agent 2,"What?
"
2,18,Agent,"Nothing.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what?
"
2,18,Agent,"Butlutlutlutlup! 
"
2,18,Agent 2,"Dr. Mephesto, where could the creature have gone?
"
2,18,Mephesto,"I have no idea!
"
2,18,Agent,"We'll never track him down on our own. This calls for some special assistance.
"
2,18,Woman,"Can I help you?
"
2,18,Larry,"Leslie. It's me, Larry.  Your husband?
"
2,18,Woman,"Husband? You're not my husband.
"
2,18,Larry,"Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years?
"
2,18,Woman,"I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass.
"
2,18,Larry,"That was me!
"
2,18,Woman,"Oh.
"
2,18,Big Man,"Who is it, lover?
"
2,18,Woman,"It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about.
"
2,18,Big Man,"Ooooo.  Well, sir, let me shake your hand. I'm proud to meet the man whose wife I'm currently sticking it to every night. 
"
2,18,Larry,"So you... remarried.
"
2,18,Woman,"Yes, Lorry.
"
2,18,Larry,"Larry!
"
2,18,Woman,"Uhlarry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on.
"
2,18,Larry,"Didn't anybody send out a search party?
"
2,18,Woman,"We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace.
"
2,18,Larry,"Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused.
"
2,18,Woman,"Leslie, I'm with Buck now. 
"
2,18,Larry,"You're Leslie.
"
2,18,Woman,"Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together.  Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry.
"
2,18,Larry,"I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone.  Eight and thirteen? 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Well, I don't see any crocs out here.
"
2,18,Stan,"Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
"
2,18,Cartman,"Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got!  Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch! 
"
2,18,Stan,"You suck as a best friend, Cartman!
"
2,18,Cartman,"You son of a bitch cat!
"
2,18,Stan,"What are you doing, Gorak!
"
2,18,Larry,"I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again.
"
2,18,Stan,"Wow, that sucks, dude.
"
2,18,Larry,"Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Steve, wait!
"
2,18,Stan,"What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
"
2,18,Kyle,"I've got something to show Steve, dick!
"
2,18,Stan,"Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
"
2,18,Larry,"What is that? 
"
2,18,Kyle,"It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 
"
2,18,Larry,"Home.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
"
2,18,Stan,"Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
"
2,18,Kyle,"No you don't, butthole! 
"
2,18,Larry,"They're coming for me!
"
2,18,Stan,"Come on! 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face. 
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Was the ice man here?
"
2,18,Cartman,"He might have been, by crikey.
"
2,18,Agent,"We have to get him back. Well, can you do it?
"
2,18,Aussie,"Sure I can! I can hunt down anything!
"
2,18,Cartman,"Wow! Kick ass!
"
2,18,Stan,"We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
"
2,18,Clerk,"Des Moines? What the hell for?
"
2,18,Kyle,"We have to get our friend, Steve-
"
2,18,Stan,"My friend, Gorak!
"
2,18,Stan,"No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Frosty, Steve, whatever.
"
2,18,Clerk,"Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat. 
"
2,18,Stan,"Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
"
2,18,Larry,"Okay, boys. Thanks. 
"
2,18,Kyle,"Okay. First one to die, loses.
"
2,18,Stan,"'K.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Okay. 
"
2,18,Stan,"O-okay.
"
2,18,Kyle,"So, here we go. 
"
2,18,Stan,"'K 
"
2,18,Kyle,"Go. 
"
2,18,Aussie,"Wait a second.  I think he came through here recently.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Yeah, I think the same thing.
"
2,18,Agent,"Well, where the hell is he? We've got to get him back to the lab.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"He can't function out here in our time!
"
2,18,Aussie,"Calm down, calm down.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.
"
2,18,Aussie,"Wait! Look!
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Is it him?
"
2,18,Aussie,"No! It's a Rocky Mountain rattle snake.  This is the most poisonous snake in this entire region.  Now, what I'm gonna do, is carefully sneak up on him, and jam my thumb up his butthole. Crikey!  Oh, this snake is really pissed!! I'm gonna jam my thumb in his butthole now!  Awww, yeah, that pissed it off all right!
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Does he always do this?
"
2,18,Agent,"Yeah.
"
2,18,Cartman,"I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.
"
2,18,Stan,"Ow!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Ow! 
"
2,18,Stan,"Watch my coat, dude.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Oh.
"
2,18,Larry,"I got my ticket.
"
2,18,Stan,"Huh? 
"
2,18,Larry,"I have to go to Platform B.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Oh. Okay, it's over this way 
"
2,18,Aussie,"The trail ends here.
"
2,18,Agent,"The train station? Then he's trying to go somewhere.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Have you seen a man who looks similar to us, but with a thicker brow and an apish nose?
"
2,18,Clerk,"What the hell are you talking about?
"
2,18,Mephesto,"An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?!
"
2,18,Larry,"Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys.
"
2,18,Stan,"No problem, Gorak.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Later.
"
2,18,Larry,"You boys have really shown me the true meaning of friendship. You didn't care about anything but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about.
"
2,18,Stan,"Yup.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Uhuh.
"
2,18,Larry,"After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world!
"
2,18,Stan,"Right on.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Cool.
"
2,18,Larry,"Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends! 
"
2,18,Mephesto,"Where is he? Where is Steve?! 
"
2,18,Stan,"His... name... is... Gorak!
"
2,18,Kyle,"His name... is Steve!
"
2,18,Agent,"The train! 
"
2,18,Mephesto,"We've got to stop it!
"
2,18,Aussie,"No worries. 
"
2,18,Agent,"Let's get him! 
"
2,18,Stan and Kyle,"No! 
"
2,18,Agent,"We've gotta stop that train!
"
2,18,Aussie,"Come back here, you! 
"
2,18,Kyle,"Steve! Steve, look out!
"
2,18,Stan,"They're after you! 
"
2,18,Aussie,"Oh, he's a wily one! 
"
2,18,Larry,"Oh, poo!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Steve, look out! 
"
2,18,Aussie,"Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric man. A sure sign the prey is frightened. As well as he should be, as I will now jam my thumb up his butthole.
"
2,18,Larry,"Huh?  Whah?!
"
2,18,Agent,"Stop the train!
"
2,18,Conductor,"Hey, who are you?
"
2,18,Agent,"I said, stop that train!
"
2,18,Conductor,"Yes, hello. I see you.
"
2,18,Cartman,"They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
"
2,18,Larry,"I've got you pinned. I win.
"
2,18,Aussie,"Now I've got you pinned. I win! 
"
2,18,Conductor,"Whoa!
"
2,18,Agent,"Hey, it's okay! The helicopter is here!  Go get him, boys!  Cut him off!
"
2,18,Larry,"Nooo!
"
2,18,Aussie,"Now for the coup de gras. I'll just... get my... thumb up... here.
"
2,18,Larry,"Oohh!
"
2,18,Pilot,"Aah, the train's not stopping.  It's not stopping!  AAAAAAAA! 
"
2,18,Aussie,"Holy bum-! 
"
2,18,Stan,"Where's Gorak??
"
2,18,Pilot,"Wow, that is the God-damnedest thing I've ever seen.
"
2,18,Agent,"Where's the ice man?!
"
2,18,Mephesto,"He has to be around here somewhere. 
"
2,18,Kyle,"I can't believe he's gone.
"
2,18,Stan,"Wait, look! The helicopter! 
"
2,18,Kyle,"Hey!
"
2,18,Stan,"He's alive!
"
2,18,Larry,"Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines!
"
2,18,Mephesto,"No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll never live!
"
2,18,Larry,"I'm not living here! Living is having ups and downs and sharing them with friends!  Thank you, Stan and Kyle! See ya! 
"
2,18,Agent,"Damn! Well, so much for our plan to use the ice man to take over Sweden.
"
2,18,Mephesto,"What?!
"
2,18,Agent,"What? Nothing!
"
2,18,Stan,"Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
"
2,18,Kyle,"No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha.
"
2,18,Stan,"Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Me, too. He sucks.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my-  Aha! There's a king croc right there!  And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its-
"
2,18,Cow,"Moo! 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.
