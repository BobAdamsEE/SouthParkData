7,1,The Boys,"School days, school days, teacher's golden rule day...
"
7,1,Kyle,"Ah, damn it!
"
7,1,Cartman,"What?
"
7,1,Kyle,"My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
"
7,1,Ike,"Suck my balls.
"
7,1,Kyle,"No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 
"
7,1,Cartman,"Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
"
7,1,Kyle,"Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!
"
7,1,Stan,"Dude, sweet! 
"
7,1,Kyle,"Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
"
7,1,Ike,"Don't kick the goddamn baby!
"
7,1,Kyle,"Kick it!
"
7,1,Ike,"Waaaah--  Ow.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Uuugh.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
7,1,Cartman,"That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Really? What about?
"
7,1,Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…
"
7,1,Stan,"Dude! Visitors!
"
7,1,Kyle,"Totally!
"
7,1,Cartman,"What?
"
7,1,Stan,"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
"
7,1,Cartman,"No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so.
"
7,1,Stan,"Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Yeah. This does seem really familiar.
"
7,1,Cartman,"What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
"
7,1,Kyle,"Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
"
7,1,Cartman,"Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.
"
7,1,Stan,"No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
"
7,1,Cartman,"No I don't remember that!
"
7,1,Kyle,"You don't?
"
7,1,Cartman,"No, because the aliens erased my memory!
"
7,1,Stan,"I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 
"
7,1,Chef,"Hello there, children! 
"
7,1,Kyle,"And then you said
"
7,1,Stan,"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
"
7,1,Chef,"Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles
"
7,1,All,"and a choice of green bean salad or vegetable medley.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Weird
"
7,1,Chef,"Say, did any of you children
"
7,1,All,"see the alien space ship last night?
"
7,1,Chef,"What the?
"
7,1,Stan,"Chef, we're in a repeat.
"
7,1,Chef,"A repeat??
"
7,1,Kyle,"Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Aw dude, I hate repeats!
"
7,1,Chef,"I've been feelin' dйjа vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on!
"
7,1,Stan,"It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
"
7,1,Chef,"We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.
"
7,1,Kyle,"What is a proc-tologist, Chef?
"
7,1,Chef,"He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.
"
7,1,Stan,"You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.
"
7,1,Chef,"That's right.
"
7,1,Kyle,"What a dick!
"
7,1,Proctologist,"Hello everyone! 
"
7,1,Chef,"Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.
"
7,1,Proctologist,"What seems to be the problem?
"
7,1,Chef,"We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Other than his monstrous size.
"
7,1,Cartman,"SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! 
"
7,1,Proctologist,"All right, let's see here.  Oh my God!!
"
7,1,Cartman,"What?
"
7,1,Proctologist,"Why, there's a huge crack goin' right down the middle! 
"
7,1,Cartman,"Haha, very funny.
"
7,1,Stan,"Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
"
7,1,Proctologist,"All right, let's take a look. 
"
7,1,Cartman,"Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
"
7,1,Chef,"Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.
"
7,1,Kyle,"And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow.
"
7,1,Proctologist,"Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...
"
7,1,Cartman,"Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.
"
7,1,Proctologist,"Wait, what's this? 
"
7,1,Kyle,"Are you okay?
"
7,1,Cartman,"Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! 
"
7,1,Chef,"Well, doctor?
"
7,1,Proctologist,"I've never quite seen this before, uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!
"
7,1,Stan,"You all right?
"
7,1,Cartman,"You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I""M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
"
7,1,Proctologist,"I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way.
"
7,1,Chef,"That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!
"
7,1,Stan,"Where to now, Chef?
"
7,1,Chef,"That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! 
"
7,1,Chef,"And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff.
"
7,1,Jeff,"How do we uh, make it come out?
"
7,1,Chef,"Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. 
"
7,1,Stan,"What?
"
7,1,Kyle,"No way!  You do it, Kenny!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Nope! It has to be Kyle!
"
7,1,Stan,"Go on.
"
7,1,Kyle,"I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
"
7,1,Chef,"Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won't bite. 
"
7,1,Kyle,"God-damnit Cartman!
"
7,1,Cartman,"I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. 
"
7,1,Kyle,"Stop it Cartman!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Okay. Okay okay. 
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Gaaahaha, he got you again!)
"
7,1,Kyle,"God Dammit!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now.  Gahaaa! Derrr!
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Derrr!)
"
7,1,Cartman,"Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.  Oh yes it is! 
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Yes it is!)
"
7,1,Chef,"Eric, that's enough!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!
"
7,1,Kyle,"That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
"
7,1,Stan,"Oh, nice going, Cartman!
"
7,1,Cartman,"All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
"
7,1,Kyle,"No!
"
7,1,Cartman,"No, go ahead. I'm dry.
"
7,1,Kyle,"You're lying!
"
7,1,Chef,"It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!
"
7,1,Cartman,"But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
"
7,1,Jeff,"Can I see this thing, please?
"
7,1,Cartman,"Okay.  Ohhh! God-dammit! 
"
7,1,Chef,"Okay. Now it's funny again.
"
7,1,Cartman,"This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
"
7,1,Kyle,"That does it! CHARGE! 
"
7,1,Chef,"What's it doing?
"
7,1,Jeff,"It, it's sending a transmission of some kind.  Got it! 
"
7,1,Kyle,"It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
"
7,1,Chef,"Where is the signal being sent to? 
"
7,1,Cartman,"Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
"
7,1,Kyle,"We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
"
7,1,Stan,"We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
"
7,1,Jeff,"Whoever they are, if they're receiving messages, they might be sending them, too. Wait a minute. c-candy bars.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Candy bars?
"
7,1,Jeff,"Yu-you know. Candy bars. They usually come in a wrapper. Just like you... wrap a Christmas present. Christmas happens when it's cold. Cold, as in Alaska - that's... with polar bears. Polar bears... pola... polarity! I can switch the polarity to see what transmissions are coming from the location this one is being sent to!  What the heck?  They're coming in! 
"
7,1,Stan,"What do we do???
"
7,1,Cartman,"It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
"
7,1,Jeff,"What?? 
"
7,1,Chef,"Help!
"
7,1,Kyle,"Aaaah! Runrunruuun! 
"
7,1,Stan,"Let's go!
"
7,1,Chef,"Get in the car, children! Get in the car! 
"
7,1,Stan,"What is that?
"
7,1,Chef,"Can you see anything, children? 
"
7,1,Kyle,"The aliens are chasing us! 
"
7,1,Chef,"God damned aliens! 
"
7,1,Stan,"Chef! End of the road! 
"
7,1,Chef,"Hold on, children!  We have to ditch them! 
"
7,1,Cartman,"What are you doing, man?! 
"
7,1,Narrator,"Looks like them boys are gettin' a little fresh air. 
"
7,1,Kyle,"I think we ditched them.
"
7,1,Chef,"I don't think we're outta the woods yet. 
"
7,1,Visitor Driver,"Coop coop.
"
7,1,Stan,"It's the police!
"
7,1,Chef,"That ain't no police! 
"
7,1,Cartman,"When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
"
7,1,Stan,"Chef!! 
"
7,1,Chef,"HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you!  Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?! 
"
7,1,The Boys,"Chef! Chef! They've got us!
"
7,1,Chef,"You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to...  Huh?  Aw crap! Children!
"
7,1,The Boys,"Cheeeeeeef!
"
7,1,Narrator,"Well, it looks like the boys are in more trouble than a June bug in molasses. And it's pretty thick molasses, too.
"
7,1,Stan,"Uh.  Wugh. You guys. Wake up! 
"
7,1,Kyle,"What the? Where are, where are we?
"
7,1,Stan,"We're in the alien ship.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!
"
7,1,Kyle,"It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
"
7,1,Cartman,"...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.
"
7,1,Stan,"Guys. Look. 
"
7,1,"Kyle, Cartman","Wow. 
"
7,1,Stan,"My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Awesome)
"
7,1,Cartman,"This is like my fifth time. 
"
7,1,Stan,"Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Oh no!) 
"
7,1,Alien,"Hello boys.
"
7,1,Stan,"Dad?
"
7,1,Alien,"No, not really. I just read your mind and thought this form might be more pleasing to you.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.
"
7,1,Stan,"Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Aw God, that movie pissed me off.
"
7,1,Alien,"Very well, I shall show my true form.  Rah rah rah rah rah. Rah rah rah rah.
"
7,1,The Boys,"AAAAH!
"
7,1,Stan,"Okay okay, take the form of something else!
"
7,1,Alien,"How's this? 
"
7,1,Cartman,"Santa!
"
7,1,Stan,"Nno, that's stupid too. 
"
7,1,Alien,"How about this? 
"
7,1,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","No.  No! 
"
7,1,Cartman,"Oooo, very nice.
"
7,1,Stan,"No! 
"
7,1,Kyle,"No! 
"
7,1,Alien,"Dy-no-mite!
"
7,1,The Boys,"No!
"
7,1,Chef,"Jeff!! The aliens took the children up on their ship.
"
7,1,Jeff,"Oh no!
"
7,1,Chef,"Did you find out what the aliens were up to?
"
7,1,Jeff,"When I reversed the polarities, I found this:  It's a message that the aliens are broadcasting throughout the entire universe. But I have no idea what it says.
"
7,1,Chef,"They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!
"
7,1,Jeff,"Wait a minute! Butt sex!
"
7,1,Chef,"Butt sex?
"
7,1,Jeff,"Butt sex requires a lot of lubrication, right? Lubrication. Lubruh... Chupuh... Chupacabra 's the, the goat killer of Mexican folklore. Folklore is stories from the past that are often fictionalized. Fictionalized to heighten drama. Drama students! Students at colleges usually have bicycles! Bi, bian, binary. It's binary code! 
"
7,1,Chef,"Who's havin' butt sex?
"
7,1,Alien,"Hello my honey, hello my baby, hello my ragtime gal! 
"
7,1,The Boys,"No!
"
7,1,Alien,"Lemme search ya, gonna work ya, hepsunudupunubuh huh.
"
7,1,The Boys,"No! 
"
7,1,Alien,"Don't piss on the moon, babe.
"
7,1,The Boys,"NO!
"
7,1,Alien,"All right, earthlings, what form do you want me to take? 
"
7,1,Cartman,"How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys?
"
7,1,Stan,"I like it.
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Me too.) 
"
7,1,Alien,"All right, then we can get back to business. Follow me this way, earthlings.  I want to apologize to you boys for all the spooky, scary stuff. We just needed to get to the malfunctioning uplink relay.
"
7,1,Stan,"You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?
"
7,1,Alien,"That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
"
7,1,Alien,"Oh, heavens no! We're a production company. We make intergalactic television programs that the whole universe watches. 
"
7,1,Stan,"Television? 
"
7,1,Alien,"We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real.  We started with great shows like, ""Who Wants To Marry A Gelgamek?"" and ""Antares 6 Millionaire"". And then we had a big hit with ""Get Me Outta Here, I'm a Klingnanian"". But then of course, there's our signature show. The greatest universal reality show of all time. 
"
7,1,Kyle,"Earth?
"
7,1,Alien,"A few billion years ago we realized, ""what if we took species from all different planets in the universe, and put them together, on the same planet?"" Great TV, right? Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer and Hispanics, all trying to live side by side on one planet! It's great! 
"
7,1,Stan,"Our planet is just a reality-TV show?
"
7,1,Alien,"Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun!
"
7,1,Kyle,"You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.
"
7,1,Alien,"Why?
"
7,1,Stan,"Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! 
"
7,1,Jeff,"Ladies and Gentleman, we have recently come across an alien transmission that is being beamed throughout the entire universe.  When decoded, it looks like this. 
"
7,1,Man,"What does it mean?
"
7,1,Jeff,"Ih it's simple mathematical language that can be understood throughout the solar system. Translated into our language, it looks like this. 
"
7,1,Announcer,"This jannemon at eight o'clock, it's everyone's favorite show! Earth! It's been one hundred Gelganighs since we first took species from seventeen different planets and put them all together, on the same planet! Oo-derp! They've fought and fallen in love! What will happen this Galgamog? Tune in jannemon at eight to find out. It's... Earth! On Fognl!
"
7,1,Jeff,"I'm afraid that Earth, a-all of Earth, is nothing but an intergalactic reality-TV show.
"
7,1,Man 2,"My God. We're famous! 
"
7,1,Jeff,"Waaaait, you don't understand!
"
7,1,Man 3,"I'm on TV! I'm on TV!
"
7,1,Man 4,"This is so awesome! 
"
7,1,Others,"Woo! Yeah! Woohoo!! 
"
7,1,Alien,"That should get the relay working again.  All right, Earthlings, if you'll step over this way we'll erase your memories and get you back to Earth.  Oh, excuse me.  This is Nagix. Uh huh. Oh no. Oh no, really? And it's, it's for sure? All right, I'll break the news to everyone. No, no I, I understand. Thanks.  Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I'm afraid it won't be there for long. The show's been cancelled.
"
7,1,Kyle,"What?? Who cancelled us?
"
7,1,Nagix,"The universal network heads. They say the Earthlings have become aware of the show, so it won't be funny anymore. 
"
7,1,Stan,"Oh shit, did we do that?
"
7,1,Nagix,"Everyone, can I have your attention real quick? Uuh, look, I just got a call from the network and I'm afraid Earth has been cancelled
"
7,1,Staff,"Awww.
"
7,1,Nagix,"Now, now, it was a great run and I think we should all be really proud.  Let's call in a demolition crew to strike the Earth for resources.
"
7,1,Stan,"Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!
"
7,1,Nagix,"Wouldn't do any good.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Dude, we have to try!
"
7,1,Stan,"Please, take us to them! Please!
"
7,1,Nagix,"All right, kids, we'll take you to the network heads. But I warn you: nobody has ever gotten the executives to uncancel a show once the call has been made. Nobody. 
"
7,1,Chef,"What the hell is that?!
"
7,1,Jeff,"There's a huge ship of some kind in Earth's orbit!  But why? Wait a minute! Chaos theory!
"
7,1,Chef,"Chaos theory??
"
7,1,Jeff,"Chaos theory, ih wah, it was first thought of in the sixties. Sixty. That's the number of episodes they made of Punky Brewster before it was cancelled. Cancelled...
"
7,1,Chef,"Huh?
"
7,1,Jeff,"Don't you see? The show is over! The aliens are canceling Earth!
"
7,1,Chef,"Oh my God! We have to stop them!
"
7,1,Voice,"Welcome to Planet Fognl, home of the Joozians, who control all media in the universe. 
"
7,1,Receptionist,"Can I help you?
"
7,1,Stan,"Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
"
7,1,Receptionist,"Where are you visiting from?
"
7,1,Stan,"Uh, Earth?
"
7,1,Receptionist,"Oooo, I watch that show all the time. 
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Gaaahahaha.  Oh, sure, come on in, Earthlings. We're just checking out our new show.
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"We took a hundred beings from the planet Marklar and put them on an asteroid with sentient beings from the Horsehead Nebula. Ih-it's a riot!
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"They hate each other!
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Gah, why? 
"
7,1,Kyle,"Mighty powerful network executives,
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Oooo, I'm starving! You Earthlings have haglar yet?
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Oh yeah, let's do haglar.
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Where do you wanna go? Meroni's?
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Not on a Flakmar. Too crowded. Ohhh, Blackafelch!
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh, Blackafelch. Perfect.
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"This place is fantastic!
"
7,1,Stan,"Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Please don't cancel us. Please.
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh I'm sorry, Earthlings, but you have to realize the universe is a business.
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"You've made it to a hundred episodes, you should be proud!
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Yeah, a show should never go past a hundred episodes, or else it starts to get stale with ridiculously stupid plotlines and settings.
"
7,1,Waitress,"Here's your order of gespahtgaplachfenachenblah. 
"
7,1,Stan,"But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Oh my God, this is great!
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"You must have some Joozian ancestry.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Tell us about it!
"
7,1,Stan,"Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh my God! Would you look at the heglars on that joozinek?
"
7,1,Stan,"Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Let's take the Earthlings to a hekmubah!
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Oh, yeah!
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh yeah, let's see those heglars!
"
7,1,Stan,"Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh, man, I am so wasted!  Hey, do you Earthlings wanna try a little glach?  Agh-oh yeah!!  Oh, gluck yeah!! 
"
7,1,Kyle,"Kenny! 
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Meeh, screw this place! Let's go get a hotel room and a hooker!
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Oh yeah!
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Yeah! 
"
7,1,Chef,"We have to find a way to stop those aliens!
"
7,1,Jeff,"Oh, their ship is massive! There's no way to stop it!  Wait a minute, jackets!
"
7,1,Chef,"Oh no.
"
7,1,Jeff,"If people don't wear jackets they could get cold. A cold is caused by a virus. A viru- a computer virus! We could make a computer virus and send it to their ships to disable their computers!
"
7,1,Chef,"That doesn't make any God-damned sense!
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Ogh.
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh yeah!
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Good.
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh yeah! Yeah!! 
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Woohoohoo! Yeah!
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Booyagh! Boy, Earthlings, is this a party or what?? 
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Oh! Oh, that's it baby! You're getting my jagon hard! 
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Wohh. Yeah, let's party!

"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh yes!! Oh yeah yeahyeah! Oh yeah!
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Oh, God. Eh eh, my head.  What did we do?
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh man, I can't believe I sucked your jagon.
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Oh God, we did suck each other's jagons! You kids won't tell anybody about this, right??
"
7,1,Cartman,"No.
"
7,1,Stan,"No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Oooo, I knew that was coming.
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"They really got us by the nezmins
"
7,1,Kyle,"The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
"
7,1,Stan,"I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
"
7,1,Cartman,"There's even World War Three to look forward to.
"
7,1,Kyle,"And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"He-all right, all right Earthlings! Ya, you win! The show can stay on.
"
7,1,The Boys,"All right!
"
7,1,Joozian 1,"Just be sure to keep up the wars and violence.
"
7,1,Joozian 2,"Well, we've got a five o'clock with the Yurka producers.  Nice meeting you Earthlings. Bye! 
"
7,1,Cartman,"Uuugh.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
7,1,Cartman,"That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Hey you guys, look.) 
"
7,1,Kyle,"What the hell is that?
"
7,1,Kenny,"(I don't know.)
"
7,1,Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
7,1,The Boys,"Hey Chef. 
"
7,1,Stan,"Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. 
"
7,1,Cartman,"What is it, Chef?
"
7,1,Chef,"I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children.  You should hang on to it.
"
7,1,Announcer,"Attention universe! Be sure to tune in next week for another exciting episode of... Earth! The Asians  are reeeally steamed at the Russians . The zebras try to get along with the buffalo.  And Americans  and Iraqis  have an all-out brawl.  It's outrageous fun and it's all new! Earth! On Fognl.
"
7,2,Announcer,"Ladies and Gentlemen, give it up for JIMMY!  Thank you! Wow. What a terrific audience.  I know what most of you are thinking. ""Hey, uh-that guy stole my show...""  Wow, what a great audience. And how about this Michael Jackson guy, huh? I mean, come on...  Wow, what a great audience.  Uh... l... lights, please? 
"
7,2,Butters,"Hey Jimmy.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Butters, w-where is everybody?
"
7,2,Butters,"Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Christopher Reeve? Christopher Reeve?!
"
7,2,Butters,"You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?!
"
7,2,Butters,"Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"So then, how come you came?
"
7,2,Butters,"Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? 
"
7,2,Mayor McDaniels,"And so without further ado, here's the most courageous, most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve. 
"
7,2,Reeve,"Thank you, thank you, wow, what a great audience.  I just flew into South Park.  Used to be I didn't need an airplane.
"
7,2,Townspeople,"Awwwww. 
"
7,2,Reeve,"As most of you know,  I am a strong supporter of stem-cell research.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show! 
"
7,2,Cartman,"We didn't go to your comedy show.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I know that, I was being f-f-f-fa...cetious! 
"
7,2,Stan,"Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude. 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do!
"
7,2,Kyle,"Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
"
7,2,Stan,"Yeah dude, not cool.
"
7,2,Reeve,"Though it is controversial,  stem cell research is critical  in the quest for helping  the disabled.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH! 
"
7,2,Stan,"Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
"
7,2,Kyle,"Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. 
"
7,2,Timmy,"Ha-a-aaa-haaa-a.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Can you believe this asswipe, Timmy?
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmeh!!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Rrruh Timmeh!
"
7,2,Reeve,"In the coming days  I will prove to the world  that stem-cell research is a miracle.
"
7,2,Cartman,"Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Hey there fellas.
"
7,2,Stan,"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled. 
"
7,2,Kyle,"What?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!
"
7,2,Stan,"That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. 
"
7,2,Cartman,"Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join.
"
7,2,Cartman,"Can too!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? One.  You know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name is. 
"
7,2,Cartman,"Oh God-damnit!!
"
7,2,Kyle,"Cartman, just stay out of it.
"
7,2,Cartman,"But they say I can't be in their club!!
"
7,2,Stan,"Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Hello, Mr. McGillicuuhuhuhh... Mr. McGillicuddy. 
"
7,2,McGillicuddy,"Hello, boys. What can I do for you?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club.  We just came up with a name this morning. 
"
7,2,McGillicuddy,"Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna wear these shirts
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Why not?
"
7,2,McGillicuddy,"Well, because there already is a group that calls themselves the Crips, and I don't think they'd like it too much.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"...There's already a Crips?!
"
7,2,McGillicuddy,"Well, sure, they're all over at Five Points area in Denver. You've never heard of them?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?
"
7,2,McGillicuddy,"...Oh, I am stayin' out of this one. 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmmeh!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.
"
7,2,King,"My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve, who,. with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms.
"
7,2,Reeve,"Thanks for having me on again, Larry.
"
7,2,King,"All right. Chris, the whole world is waiting. Why don't you show us what stem-cell research has done for you.  Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks? Now, Chris, there're some people who say stem-cell research is wrong, that takling cells from a fetus is... unethical.
"
7,2,Reeve,"Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated  about stem-cell research. See, the stem cells from a fetus like this one  can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet.
"
7,2,King,"And how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells, Chris?
"
7,2,Reeve,"Well, it's very simple.  And now you can see, my arms have better movement.
"
7,2,King,"Wow.  Wow.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Excuse me, sir.  we're looking for a group of people called the Crips.
"
7,2,Bum,"You are?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.
"
7,2,Bum,"The Crips hang out at that old warehouse down there,  but ...nobody goes in there.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmmih! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Well hello everyone.  I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmmih!  Tih... ti-timmih.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc Denver chapter.
"
7,2,Large Crip,"Is they for real, manh?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident?
"
7,2,Braided Crip,"The only Crips is born Crips, dawg.
"
7,2,Tall Crip,"Yeah, you can't become a Crip by accident, fool!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I agree. I mean, it's like  ""come on""! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group?
"
7,2,Buff Crip,"All right, you wanna thug with the Five Point Crips? Bitches, all you gotta do is pop some punk-ass Bloods.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Well, sure. Tim and I would love to pop some punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific at it.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I don't know, Timmy, just play along.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Uh-tu-Timmih!
"
7,2,Buff Crip,"So you sayin' yuh down?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww... Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown. 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park. 
"
7,2,Officer,"Hey you kids.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Well hello, officers.
"
7,2,Officer,"What the hell do you think you're doin'?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store.  That must be what the fellas meant by ""pop some punk-ass Bloods."" They want us to get them some soda pop and treats.  Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Oh, Timmih. 
"
7,2,Driver,"Oh shit! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver!
"
7,2,Buff Crip,"Yo yo, listen up y'all! Let me tell you about my little Gs, Roller and 4 Legs here. They just smoked thirteen Bloods in one night!
"
7,2,Crip 1,"One night?
"
7,2,Crip 2,"You're kiddin'? You're kiddin'? One night?
"
7,2,Buff Crip,"That ain't never been done before!
"
7,2,Crips,"Uh huh. Cool. He's right.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?
"
7,2,Buff Crip,"You're not just in, you're the baddest mofo Crips in town! Cipac!  Turn up the beat so we can celebrate our new Gs Five-Points style!
"
7,2,Cipac,"All right. 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Wow, these guys really are crippled.  Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time.
"
7,2,Cipac,"Alrighty. Keep it real though, dawg.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"You dawgs keep it real, too. 
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Well, that sure was a terrific time. Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
7,2,Mom,"There you are, Jimmy!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops?
"
7,2,Pops,"Jimmy, you rmother was gettin' worried about you.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool. 
"
7,2,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news. Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand.
"
7,2,Reeve,"Thank you everyone.  To most people, this is just an ordinary fetus. But to people like me,  it's hope. 
"
7,2,Crowd,"Uugh.
"
7,2,Mr. Garrison,"What an inspiration.
"
7,2,Reporter,"Tom, many celebrities have spoken out in protest of stem-cell research, but, after seeing this, how can they protest now? 
"
7,2,Stan,"Stay clear, guys, stay clear.
"
7,2,Kyle,"Yup. I'm not seeing anything.
"
7,2,Mr. Kim,"Hey  Hey, I don't want no trouber!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung ...Pao Chicken, please.
"
7,2,Mr. Kim,"I don't want no trouble! You jus... take what you want and reave!
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
7,2,Mr. Kim,"OH! Okay, okay!  I opening register
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmh.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"What's that? Oh, and one medium lemonade, please.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
7,2,Mr. Kim,"Here. Here one hundred twelve dorrar! It's all I have. Yeh take!

7,2,Jimmy,"Hunh?

7,2,Jimmy,"Ah- are you sure?
"
7,2,Mr. Kim,"I no want no trouble. Just take it and reave!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Well gee, that's really nice of you, Mr. ...Chinese person.  Look Tim-Tim, we got a cash prize. We must be the ...one hundredth customer or something.
"
7,2,Mr. Kim,"Here! Here two order of Kung Pao Chicken, and small ice tea!

7,2,Jimmy,"Actually, it was a regular lemonade.

7,2,Mr. Kim,"AAAAAGH-agh!!  I sorry! I sorry! I no want no trouble.  Here. Remonade.  Now go, just go!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
7,2,Mr. Kim,"Hello! Police? I've just been robbed by two gang members!
"
7,2,Pops,"Jimmy? Jimmy, could you come into the kitchen please?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Yo, Mamsie. What's up, Pops?
"
7,2,Pops,"Uh have a seat, Jim. Your mother and I need to talk to you.  Son, your mother and I have noticed a change in your behavior. And... we're worried that you might be involved in a gang.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg.
"
7,2,Mamsie,"Then it's true! Oh, Ryan, it's true! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean  come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much.
"
7,2,Ryan,"Jimmy, those people you're hanging out with are no good.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends.
"
7,2,Mamsie,"And what about your standup comedy, Jim, huh? Are you just giving up on that, too?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!
"
7,2,Ryan,"Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God made you the way he did for a reason!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.
"
7,2,Ryan,"That's right. You were sent here through the vengeful and angry hand of God to teach your mother and I a lesson. And that's a big responsibility, son.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the nigga on your left. 
"
7,2,Reeve,"Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again.
"
7,2,Aide,"Here's the new shipment, sir.  Hey! 
"
7,2,Man,"Hello there, Christopher. 
"
7,2,Reeve,"Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you?
"
7,2,Hackman,"I'm good. You?
"
7,2,Reeve,"I am better with each passing day.  Stronger and more agile. 
"
7,2,Hackman,"Christopher, I've come to ask you to stop what you're doing?
"
7,2,Reeve,"What?
"
7,2,Hackman,"Using stem cells is like playing God. You should leave nature alone.
"
7,2,Reeve,"And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?
"
7,2,Hackman,"I'm saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards you're dealt, Christopher.
"
7,2,Reeve,"Stop calling me Christopher! That name no longer has meaning to me! Christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair! Always being pushed around by others! The old Christopher Reeve is dead! From now on, I am...  Chris!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six- 
"
7,2,Blood,"Payback time, mothafucka! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Jesus Christ!  Holy G...guacamole!  Freakin' Frijoles!  Leapin' L-langosta. 
"
7,2,Blood,"East Side Bloods! 
"
7,2,Hyde,"We're Detectives Hyde and Richardson from the Special Gang unit in Denver.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer?
"
7,2,Richardson,"Word on the street is it was a retaliation hit by the Bloods.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"The... B-Bloods?
"
7,2,Hyde,"You know, smart-mouth! Your rival gang! The Bloods are at war with the Crips, they kill each other all the time!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"The-they do??
"
7,2,Richardson,"Don't act like you don't know, you lil punk! The Crips and Bloods hate each other, and if you stay in that gang, you're gonna end up dead too.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"But... but why do they hate each other?
"
7,2,Hyde,"Look kid, I used to be a Crip myself, but I'm not anymore!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?
"
7,2,Hyde,"Come on. The only way these kids are gonna get out of their gang is get killed. 
"
7,2,Ryan,"Sarah!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Tim-mih.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to sstop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"This is gonna be t-terrific!
"
7,2,Reporter,"Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher Reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed. The irony, of course, is that the man who played Superman could no longer walk. America watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers, then his arms. And now, seen for the first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head. 
"
7,2,Randy,"Oh, what a fighter.
"
7,2,Gerald,"That brave, brave man.
"
7,2,Liane,"He's an imspration to us all.
"
7,2,Reporter,"Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength.
"
7,2,Hackman,"Chris, that's enough!
"
7,2,Reeve,"Hello, Gene! So good to see you!
"
7,2,Hackman,"You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop using stem cells.
"
7,2,Reeve,"Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?!
"
7,2,Reporter,"Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies, has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research. If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't knw what is.
"
7,2,Hackman,"They're affecting your mind, Chris. If you won't stop using stem cells, then we'll stop you!
"
7,2,Reeve,"Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!!  You won't stop me, Hack Man!  Ha HA! Ha HA! Ha haa haa!  Ya ha ha! Yaa haha!
"
7,2,Reporter,"Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.  Great to see you all. What a terrific audience.
"
7,2,Janitor,"Are you sure you got everything you need, young man?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by.
"
7,2,Mr. Appleby,"Just remember to make sure the kids play safe in the pool area.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"You bet. 
"
7,2,Mr. Appleby,"I'll be back at seven to let you out. You kids have a good time.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Oh, we will. 
"
7,2,Buff Crip,"The Bloods!
"
7,2,Blood 1,"Oh shit! It's a trap!
"
7,2,Blood 2,"Muthafucka Crips tryin' to smoke us all out!
"
7,2,Crip,"What the hell is goin' on here? 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along.  Theeerrre's pizzaaa.
"
7,2,Reporter,"Tom, over five years ago, doctors told Christopher Reeve that he would never walk again, but the resilient actor fought back, struggled against all odds, and has now built his very own Legion of Doom!  The once immobile Mr. Reeve's new organization will be committed to world domination and evil. What an inspirational story, Tom.
"
7,2,Reeve,"I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery,  Their desire for world conquest,  and their hatred of all things good!  And I've assembled this group for one purpose! To once and for all find a way to...  get rid of Hack Man!! 
"
7,2,Dr. Doom,"Uhhh, how about domination of the world?
"
7,2,Saddam Hussein,"Yeah. Or uh, death to the infidels?
"
7,2,Reeve,"Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission.
"
7,2,Professor Chaos,"Oh boy, General Disarray, muh maybe we just oughtta stay outta this one.
"
7,2,Hackman,"Not so fast, Chris!
"
7,2,Reeve,"Hack Man!
"
7,2,Hackman,"We just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research. Your fetus-sucking days are over!
"
7,2,Reeve,"No...  NOOOO!
"
7,2,Hackman,"And now we're goingn to put you somewhere where you can never touch another fetus again!
"
7,2,Buff Crip,"You stupid mofos are dead!
"
7,2,Blood 3,"Make the first shot, punk!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers.
"
7,2,Blood 4,"Save it, fool! Crips ain't our brothers! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Look: we hve the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?
"
7,2,Blood 5,"Yeah, we ain't playin', sucka!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean,  Come on! 
"
7,2,Buff Crip,"Wait a minute. What did you say?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I said, ""I mean,  Come on!""
"
7,2,Blood 4,"You know, maybe he's right. I mean,  Come on!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Come on.
"
7,2,Buff Crip,"I guess we could at least give havin' fun together a try. It's like  Come on.
"
7,2,Blood 6,"Yeah. Come on.
"
7,2,Crip 2,"Yeah, that's right. Come on.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Come on.
"
7,2,Someone,"Come on.
"
7,2,All,"Yeah, that's right. Come on. 
"
7,2,Buff Crip,"I've gotta give you two dawgs props for puttin' an end to all this hate.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger.
"
7,2,Blood,"Right on!
"
7,2,Crip,"Hey little Roller, try some of this chronic shit.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?
"
7,2,Gang Members,"It used to be that Crips and Bloods didn't get along,
But now we're all a family, so we wrote this song.
Naaa na naaa, Crips and Bloods. Naaa na naaa, hope and love.
Naaa na naaa, friendly thugs.
"
7,2,Reeve,"You haven't seen the last of me, Hack Man! I will be back!!
"
7,2,Stan,"Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
"
7,2,Kyle,"Mee tooo.
"
7,3,Teacher,"Okay. Good, children, good. Remember to feel the clay. Be one with the clay. Nice. Uh huh. 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Put more clay on the balls.
"
7,3,Teacher,"Boys!  What is that?
"
7,3,Kyle,"A reindeer?
"
7,3,Teacher,"You know, I've had it! You four boys never take art class seriously!
"
7,3,Cartman,"What a crime. 
"
7,3,Teacher,"You think art is not important?
"
7,3,Stan,"Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.
"
7,3,Butters,"I love our class!
"
7,3,Stan,"See?
"
7,3,Teacher,"Do you think this is funny?!  Do you think this is funny, huh?!  Well, you four can just spend your afternoon after school here making new pottery! 
"
7,3,Cartman,"You can't do that!
"
7,3,Teacher,"I certainly can! I'm your teacher!
"
7,3,Cartman,"You're an art teacher!
"
7,3,Teacher,"Make it two hours!
"
7,3,Stan,"Mrs. Streible thinks she's so cool!
"
7,3,Kyle,"How dare she talk to us like that?!
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)
"
7,3,Cartman,"We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
"
7,3,Stan,"Like what?
"
7,3,Cartman,"Like find out where Mrs. Streible lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
7,3,Kyle,"TP her house?
"
7,3,Cartman,"Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh.
"
7,3,Cartman,"What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken?  Ugh! 
"
7,3,Teacher,"Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime, you're being punished!
"
7,3,Stan,"Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!
"
7,3,Stan,"D'you think that's enough?
"
7,3,Cartman,"Should be fine.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum. 
"
7,3,Cashier,"Hello boys. Find everything you need?
"
7,3,Cartman,"Yep. All set.
"
7,3,Cashier,"Mokay, let's see here. Toilet paper  Toilet paper  Toilet paper  Toilet paper  Toilet paper  So, what are you kids up to tonight? 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
"
7,3,Cashier,"Nice relaxing night at home, huh? Toilet paper  Toilet paper  Aaand toilet paper  Eh, hey.  Now you kids be careful with this chewing gum.Don't go sticking it under tables.
"
7,3,Stan,"Okay.
"
7,3,Cashier,"Okay. Toilet paper  Toilet paper  Tooilet paper  You know, son, I rmember you comin' in last week and buying this much toilet paper. 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Heh yeah, that that's right.
"
7,3,Cashier,"... Toilet paper  Toilet paper 
"
7,3,Kyle,"You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?
"
7,3,Cartman,"No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh.  Uuugh.
"
7,3,Stan,"Is this the right house?
"
7,3,Cartman,"It's the right address-wait! Look there!  There's Mrs. Streible! This is the place. 
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.
"
7,3,Cartman,"So?
"
7,3,Kyle,"So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
"
7,3,Stan,"Kyle, we all agreed to do this!
"
7,3,Kyle,"We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! 
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Yeah! Fuck you!)
"
7,3,Cartman,"Come on, let's go! 
"
7,3,Kyle,"What have we done? 
"
7,3,Stan,"Let's go, Kyle! 
"
7,3,Kyle,"We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Aw man, that was sooo awesome! 
"
7,3,Kyle,"How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Who cares??
"
7,3,Kyle,"Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. 
"
7,3,Stan,"Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Noo! No.  Noo! 
"
7,3,Mrs. Streible,"AAAAAAAAA!
"
7,3,Mr. Streible,"Honey, what is it?? Oh, Jesus no! Our house!
"
7,3,The Streible Girls,"Mommy! Mommy!
"
7,3,Mr. Streible,"Whyyy? Whyyy?
"
7,3,Kyle,"Ah! Oh God! Oh God!
"
7,3,Butters,"Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper.
"
7,3,Clyde,"Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.
"
7,3,Butters,"I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. 
"
7,3,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Damn!
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh God!
"
7,3,Kyle,"How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
"
7,3,Cartman,"Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
"
7,3,Stan,"We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
"
7,3,Kyle,"I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?
"
7,3,Stan,"Yes, dude!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
"
7,3,Kyle,"Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...
"
7,3,Cartman,"Oh, for Christ's sake!
"
7,3,Stan,"Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?
"
7,3,Mr. Mackey,"We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please?
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Me??)
"
7,3,Mr. Mackey,"Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k? 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Why are they doing us one at a time?
"
7,3,Cartman,"They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
"
7,3,Kyle,"I can get a better deal?
"
7,3,Cartman,"Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
"
7,3,Mr. Streible,"There we go. That should be about the last of it.  Ex- excuse me, uh, wha-what are you doing?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Crime scene investigation!  There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? 
"
7,3,Mr. Streible,"Ah... look, we really don't wanna make a big deal out of this.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.
"
7,3,Mr. Streible,"Lo-ih ih it's just not that big a deal, I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself when I was a kid.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!
"
7,3,Mr. Streible,"I was here.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Aha!! Got you!
"
7,3,Mr. Streible,"Officer, why would I TP my own house?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Insurance?
"
7,3,Mr. Streible,"It wasn't me, okay? Now, if you don't mind, I just wanna get my yard back to normal.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.
"
7,3,Mr. Streible,"You really have nothing better to do, do you?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"No I do not.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Noo! No.  Noo! 
"
7,3,Mrs. Streible,"AAAAAAAAA!
"
7,3,Mr. Streible,"Oh, Jesus no! Our house!
"
7,3,The Streible Girls,"Mommy! Mommy!
"
7,3,Nancy Kerrigan,"Whyyy? Whyyy? Whyyy?
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?
"
7,3,Kyle,"I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
"
7,3,Cartman,"No need. I have one for you right here. 
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh. Okay. Thanks.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Is there anything else I can get for you?
"
7,3,Kyle,"Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
"
7,3,Cartman,"You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. 
"
7,3,Warden,"Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year.  He's a real monster.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"I just need to talk to someonen who knows how toilet paperers think.
"
7,3,Warden,"Just remember: he'd toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance.  He's the last cell on your left. 
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police.
"
7,3,Josh,"That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer. You should try something more... casual.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?
"
7,3,Josh,"And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?
"
7,3,Josh,"Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome that becomes.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.
"
7,3,Josh,"No, but it was worth a try, wasn't it?  Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town. You must have had larger inspirations. What happened to those... big-city dreams?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, that's kind of personal.
"
7,3,Josh,"Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what I want to know. And I'll help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know.
"
7,3,Josh,"Are those the crime scene photos? Let me see them.  Yes. Yes. Not bad work, not bad at all. These toilet-paperers are professionals...at least one of them is.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"So you think there was more than one. Why?
"
7,3,Josh,"Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! 
"
7,3,Josh,"Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
"
7,3,Stan,"What about him?
"
7,3,Cartman,"Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
"
7,3,Kenny,"(I think so too.)
"
7,3,Cartman,"Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
"
7,3,Butters,"Ha-ey fellas. 
"
7,3,Stan,"Butters. 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!
"
7,3,Stan,"So what should we do?
"
7,3,Cartman,"We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
"
7,3,Stan,"... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
7,3,Cartman,"Why not?
"
7,3,Stan,"Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?
"
7,3,Cartman,"He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. 
"
7,3,Cashier,"You wanted to see me, Officer Barbrady?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene.  I'm... sorry I have to do this. 
"
7,3,Mr. Bell,"Oh my God.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Is this toilet paper from your store?
"
7,3,Mr. Bell,"It's... difficult to tell, it's... so decayed, I... wait a minute, yes. Yes, I recognize the floral pattern now.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Positive ID on the toilet paper. 
"
7,3,Mr. Bell,"Who would... do this to toilet paper? Who?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?
"
7,3,Mr. Bell,"Suspicious like how?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern.
"
7,3,Mr. Bell,"Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall bought toasted tarts and chips and... we don't allow Middle Eastern people in the store.  Oh my God! 
"
7,3,Kyle,"What's this all about, Cartman?
"
7,3,Cartman,"I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
"
7,3,Kyle,"A boat ride?
"
7,3,Cartman,"I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Well, okay.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?
"
7,3,Kyle,"Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
"
7,3,Cartman,"And you feel like you have to confess.
"
7,3,Kyle,"I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
"
7,3,Cartman,"I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. 
"
7,3,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. 
"
7,3,Kyle,"You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Won't be long, Kyle. 
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Josh, I need your help.
"
7,3,Josh,"The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"How do you mean?
"
7,3,Josh,"Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Yes.
"
7,3,Josh,"Single-sheet?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you?
"
7,3,Josh,"Why does one toilet-paper houses
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"To get revenge.
"
7,3,Josh,"No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"What do you mean?
"
7,3,Josh,"Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"I don't have time for this, kid.
"
7,3,Josh,"Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool hiyouse?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps! 
"
7,3,Josh,"Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh. Of course! One of her students!
"
7,3,Josh,"Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've got some arrests to make.  Fly fly flyyy. Fly fly flyyy.
"
7,3,Warden,"Josh,  were you doing the silly voice for the policeman again?
"
7,3,Josh,"No, sir.
"
7,3,Stan,"Cartman, what are you doing?
"
7,3,Cartman,"I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
"
7,3,Stan,"You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
"
7,3,Cartman,"They did?
"
7,3,Kyle,"They did?
"
7,3,Stan,"They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
"
7,3,Cartman,"But can I still kill Kyyyle?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Hello boys. How are you?
"
7,3,Stan,"We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"It sure is!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Uh, can we see them-him-her?
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. 
"
7,3,Butters,"Hey fellas!
"
7,3,Stan,"Butters?
"
7,3,Butters,"Yep. I'm in jail.
"
7,3,Kyle,"You con-fessed?
"
7,3,Butters,"Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"His parents are on their way down now.
"
7,3,Butters,"Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
"
7,3,Kyle,"You guys, we can't let him do this!
"
7,3,Cartman,"What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
"
7,3,Butters,"Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
"
7,3,Kyle,"Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Why do you say that?
"
7,3,Kyle,"Because it was-
"
7,3,Cartman,"Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?
"
7,3,Butters,"You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.
"
7,3,Cartman,"You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
"
7,3,Kyle,"I still feel bad, Cartman
"
7,3,Cartman,"What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Yeah. That makes it even worse.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
"
7,3,Kyle,"I know.
"
7,3,Cartman,"So... so then, how can you feel bad?
"
7,3,Stan,"He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
"
7,3,Cartman,"...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
"
7,3,Stan,"It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Yeah, maybe we should.)
"
7,3,Cartman,"What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!
"
7,3,Kyle,"We feel bad for other people.
"
7,3,Cartman,"For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?
"
7,3,Stan,"Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!
"
7,3,Stephen,"Well well well! I had to see it to believe it! 
"
7,3,Butters,"Hi, Dad.
"
7,3,Stephen,"Don't you ""Hi, Dad"" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!
"
7,3,Butters,"Yeah.
"
7,3,Linda,"What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Huh??
"
7,3,Stephen,"Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady.
"
7,3,Linda,"Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!
"
7,3,Butters,"Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
"
7,3,Stephen,"And that's your excuse?!
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now. 
"
7,3,Stephen,"Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!
"
7,3,Butters,"Officer, can I stay in jail, please?
"
7,3,Cartman,"Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry!
"
7,3,Stan,"What is it, Cartmam? 
"
7,3,Cartman,"It's over this way! Come on!
"
7,3,Cartman,"So how are things, guys?
"
7,3,Stan,"Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
"
7,3,Cartman,"I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
"
7,3,Kyle,"You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Can't I? 
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Excuse me, everyone.  I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house!  Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person. 
"
7,3,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know-
"
7,3,Kyle,"Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.
"
7,3,Principal Victoria,"All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?
"
7,3,Josh,"What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?
"
7,3,Principal Victoria,"Get him out of here!
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?
"
7,3,Josh,"Ooo, Polceman Brown, never quite made officer. Why is that, Polceman Brown? 
"
7,3,Kyle,"We have to confess that we were the ones that-
"
7,3,Mr. Mackey,"It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything.
"
7,3,Stan,"You, you do? How?
"
7,3,Cartman,"Hi guys.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Cartman??
"
7,3,Cartman,"I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
"
7,3,Principal Victoria,"Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.
"
7,3,Cartman,"My consciences just caught up with me.
"
7,3,Kyle,"That's not fair!
"
7,3,Mr. Mackey,"You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave.
"
7,3,Kyle,"But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. 
"
7,3,Kyle,"This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Okay, Josh, time to go back to the...  Oh no!
"
7,3,Policeman Brown,"He... He was too fast for me. He ran out the door!
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Couldn't you have gone after him?
"
7,3,Policeman Brown,"Well, ah I'm covered in toilet paper. I'd look silly.
"
7,3,Mr. Mackey,"Welcome to detention. You will be here till five o'clock, so make good study use of your time. M'kay?
"
7,3,Stan,"Wugh! Two weeks of this!
"
7,3,Kyle,"Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
"
7,3,Cartman,"I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh Jesus! 
"
7,3,Cartman,"I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
"
7,3,Kyle,"You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Hm.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Police station.
"
7,3,Josh,"Hello Officer Barbrady.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Josh? Josh, where are you?!
"
7,3,Josh,"I'm afraid that giving away my location might be harmful to my freedom, officer. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get out of that dingy cell.
"
7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.
"
7,3,Josh,"Sorry, officer, gotta run. There's something I've been meaning to do for quite some time. Ciao. 
"
7,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?
"
7,4,Mr. Slave,"All donesy wunsy. 
"
7,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problems.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that?
"
7,4,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, and by the way, children, there's a walkout scheduled today to protest the war in Iraq. So, uh, if you're against the war, run along outside, and if you're for the war, uh, stay here and we'll do math problems. 
"
7,4,The Boys,"We got out of schoo-l! No more school toda-ay!
"
7,4,Kyle,"What should we do?
"
7,4,Stan,"Let's go see a movie! 
"
7,4,Protesters,"No war! No war!  No war! No war!  No war! No war!  No war! No war! No war!
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"No war, m'kay?! No war, m'kay?! Oh uh, here you go, boys.  These will help you protest. It's good to see that you care about peace, boys, m'kay? No war, m'kay?!
"
7,4,A voice,"Excuse me, boys.  Tom Stansel, HBC news. Can you kids tell me why you marched out of school today? 
"
7,4,Stan,"Uh... war?
"
7,4,Tom,"Right. What about the war?
"
7,4,Kyle,"Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?
"
7,4,Tom,"Uh huh, and what aspect of it do you think is most gay?
"
7,4,Kyle,"Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.
"
7,4,Stan,"Yeah.  War is not my voice.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Bush is a Naizi
"
7,4,Skeeter,"Hey all you un-American bastards! If you don't like America, why don't you git out?! 
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"Don't you call us un-American! This country was founded on the right to protest! M'kay?
"
7,4,Protesters,"Yeah! Right!
"
7,4,Stuart,"If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!
"
7,4,Supporters,"Yeah! Right!
"
7,4,Randy,"The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
"
7,4,Skeeter,"Foundin' Fathers would kick all your asses!
"
7,4,Tom,"Boys, what do you think the Founding Fathers would say?
"
7,4,Cartman,"...Eh the... Founding who? 
"
7,4,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves!  Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?!
"
7,4,Butters,"Mmuh well, not really, no.
"
7,4,Mr. Garrison,"Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!
"
7,4,Class,"Awwwwww!
"
7,4,Mr. Garrison,"SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you! 
"
7,4,Cartman,"Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! 
"
7,4,Kyle,"Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
"
7,4,Cartman,"But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
"
7,4,Stan,"You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Maaaa. M-maaaa.
"
7,4,Kyle,"Shut up and study!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?
"
7,4,Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
7,4,Cartman,"I'm trying to have a flashback.
"
7,4,Kenny,"(A what?)
"
7,4,Cartman,"You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!
"
7,4,Stan,"No, you just have to study.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.
"
7,4,Kyle,"That isn't gonna work, dumbass!
"
7,4,Mr. Slave,"Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me.
"
7,4,Stan,"Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!
"
7,4,Skeeter,"There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side. 
"
7,4,Randy,"How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!
"
7,4,Protesters,"Hahahaha, yeah.
"
7,4,Jimbo,"You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side o' the town!
"
7,4,Protester,"Hey wait a minute, your side of town has the post office.
"
7,4,Stuart,"Well your side has the grocery store.
"
7,4,Jimbo,"Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.
"
7,4,Gerald,"Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?
"
7,4,Jimbo,"W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.
"
7,4,Townsfolk,"Yup, yes sir, yeah, right, uh huh.
"
7,4,Skeeter,"Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.
"
7,4,Randy,"He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool. 
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 
"
7,4,Cartman,"That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. 
"
7,4,Stan,"How?!
"
7,4,Cartman,"All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. 
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman? Cartman?? 
"
7,4,Cartman,"Benjamin Franklin?
"
7,4,Kyle,"No, turdpants, it's Kyle!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!
"
7,4,Townsfolk,"Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
"
7,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay, people. What are we rabbling about now?
"
7,4,Randy,"Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.
"
7,4,Skeeter,"That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago!
"
7,4,Gerald,"There was no war months ago!
"
7,4,Skeeter,"Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!
"
7,4,Randy,"Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!
"
7,4,Stuart,"Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! 
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"Well up yours, rednecks!
"
7,4,Townsfolk,"Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
"
7,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have to give the town square to both groups.
"
7,4,Jimbo,"All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!
"
7,4,Randy,"Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!
"
7,4,Skeeter,"We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle!
"
7,4,Gerald,"Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!
"
7,4,Stan,"Cartman?
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! 
"
7,4,Cartman,"Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
"
7,4,Stan,"Oh no...
"
7,4,Cartman,"Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
"
7,4,Cartman,"I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
"
7,4,Stan,"Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Or a really sweet one. 
"
7,4,TiVo,"Your TiVo is full.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Whoa, here it goes! 
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman?  Cartman??
"
7,4,Stan,"Aww crap.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Ohhh awesome!!! 
"
7,4,Driver,"Worthy young lad, are you all right?
"
7,4,Cartman,"Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
"
7,4,Driver,"This year? Why it's 1776, it is.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Oho yes! I did it I did it!
"
7,4,Driver,"Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's hosue to get a very important document, I am.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Oho kick fucking ass, dude! 
"
7,4,Driver,"Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?
"
7,4,Cartman,"No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
"
7,4,Driver,"A flashback? Why, what is that?
"
7,4,Cartman,"Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.
"
7,4,Liane,"Is he going to be all right, doctor??
"
7,4,Dr. Doctor,"Your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion I've never seen before. His chances of surviving are very slim. I'm so sorry.
"
7,4,Liane,"Oh baby baby, you can't die.
"
7,4,Kyle,"Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 
"
7,4,Liane,"Whoa. Easy, Kyle.
"
7,4,Kyle,"But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
"
7,4,Stan,"I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!
"
7,4,Liane,"I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!
"
7,4,Driver,"Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Super neato! 
"
7,4,Driver,"I'm afraid you'll have to wait here.
"
7,4,Cartman,"But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
"
7,4,Driver,"Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson
"
7,4,Cartman,"Oh, okay.I guess I understand. 'I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...''I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...
"
7,4,Jefferson,"Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.
"
7,4,Cartman,"And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
"
7,4,Jefferson,"Very well. Take this document to the Continental Congress. 
"
7,4,Cartman,"Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.
"
7,4,Jefferson,"Some favir going to war with England and others want to avoid war at all cost.
"
7,4,Cartman,"It's a bitch, ain't it?
"
7,4,Jefferson,"Perhaps this document will make the reasons for war obvious to all. Good luck, young messenger!  Now make haste!
"
7,4,Stan,"Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-
"
7,4,Protesters,"No war! No war! No war!
"
7,4,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus...
"
7,4,Randy,"Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.
"
7,4,Stan,"Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"Hey... That's a terrific idea!
"
7,4,Gerald,"Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!
"
7,4,Stan,"Oh, no, nononono.
"
7,4,Supporters,"Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops!
"
7,4,Skeeter,"See? I told you they had your son.
"
7,4,Stuart,"Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?!
"
7,4,Kenny,"(I'm doing my homework.)
"
7,4,Randy,"The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! 
"
7,4,Stan,"Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-
"
7,4,Stuart,"Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country!  Come on, Kenny!
"
7,4,Kenny,"(But Dad, I-)
"
7,4,Stuart,"NOW!
"
7,4,Skeeter,"Yeah!
"
7,4,Supporters,"Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! 
"
7,4,Stan,"Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
"
7,4,Kyle,"God damnit!
"
7,4,Randy,"Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.
"
7,4,Gerald,"Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!
"
7,4,Protester 1,"Yeah, that's right!
"
7,4,Protester 2,"Come on, guys!
"
7,4,Protester 3,"Get back to work!
"
7,4,Kyle,"Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
"
7,4,A voice,"Enter, young messenger.  I am John Hancock, President of the Congress.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Wow.
"
7,4,Hancock,"Mr. John Adams?
"
7,4,Adams,"Aye. 
"
7,4,Hancock,"Will you do the honors of reading the document to Congress, please? 
"
7,4,Adams,"WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one Penis to rise up-  -we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.P.S. - Every Thursday should be Free Ice Cream Day. 
"
7,4,A Congressman,"Excuse me, but does this Declaration actually suggest that we should go to go war with England?
"
7,4,Adams,"We have no choice, Mr. Dickinson. 
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? .
"
7,4,Skeeter,"Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to support our troops, right?! 
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war.
"
7,4,Skeeter,"Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first!
"
7,4,Jimbo,"Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!
"
7,4,Mayor McDaniels,"People, I told you, you have to share the stage.
"
7,4,Randy,"Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!
"
7,4,Skeeter,"Well excuse me if... I'm a little bit country.
"
7,4,Randy,"Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!
"
7,4,Skeeter,"I'm a little for supportin' our troops.
"
7,4,Randy,"And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.
"
7,4,Skeeter,"I believe freedom isn't free.
"
7,4,Randy,"No, but war shouldn't be our goal.
"
7,4,Skeeter,"We must defend our country.
"
7,4,Randy,"If it means war, then we say NO!
"
7,4,Somebody,"Yeehaw!
"
7,4,Skeeter,"'Did you forget them towers in New York?'Did you forget how it made you feel'To see them towers come down?'Were you like me? Did you think it weren't real?
"
7,4,Randy,"I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!
"
7,4,Skeeter,"We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead. We're gonna show Saddam what America means; that son of a bitch'll be dead.
"
7,4,Randy,"Why are we fightin' this war?'There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.'They didn't give me a choice.'War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!
"
7,4,Adams,"We must go to war!
"
7,4,Dickinson,"But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy.
"
7,4,Congressman 1,"England will only understand one thing: Force.
"
7,4,Congressman 2,"I must state again for the record that South Carolina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia are against war! 
"
7,4,Congressman 3,"Yeah, because you don't care about the fate of the Colonies like we do! You're all unpatriotic! And if you don't like the Colonies, then you can git out!
"
7,4,Dickinson,"Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want! 
"
7,4,Cartman,"Whoa, how very very relevant.
"
7,4,Tom,"Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in.
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war. 
"
7,4,Protesters,"Booooo!!
"
7,4,Randy,"For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. 
"
7,4,Stan,"Uh, we didn't do it.
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"What?
"
7,4,Kyle,"We didn't do our homework.
"
7,4,Sharon,"Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!
"
7,4,Stan,"Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-
"
7,4,Skeeter,"That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war!
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!
"
7,4,Supporters,"Support!
"
7,4,Protesters,"Protest!
"
7,4,Supporters,"Country!
"
7,4,Protesters,"Rock-n-roll!
"
7,4,Congressmen,"Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!
"
7,4,Dickinson,"We cannot found a country based on war!
"
7,4,Adams,"We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!
"
7,4,Congressman,"Rabble!
"
7,4,Congressmen,"Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!  Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. 
"
7,4,Cartman,"Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
"
7,4,Hancock,"Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue?
"
7,4,Franklin,"I believe that if we are to form a new country, we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a country that appears to want both?
"
7,4,Jefferson,"Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time.
"
7,4,Dickinson,"Right. If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it.
"
7,4,Franklin,"And that means that as a nation, we could go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the country will be forever blameless.
"
7,4,Adams,"It's like having your cake, and eating it, too.
"
7,4,Congressman 2,"Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying one thing and doing another.
"
7,4,Hancock,"And we will call that country the United States of America.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Wow!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Everyone, stop! Please! 
"
7,4,Townsman,"The-the child! The child, from the hospital.
"
7,4,Cartman,"If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
"
7,4,Stan,"He does? 
"
7,4,Kyle,"He does?
"
7,4,Cartman,"I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too.""
"
7,4,Randy,"He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.
"
7,4,Skeeter,"Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President.
"
7,4,Gerald,"And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"I guess we... owe you an apology.
"
7,4,Stuart,"Eh-ah, I guess we owe you one.
"
7,4,Townsfolk,"Awww. 
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman? Cartman saved the day?
"
7,4,Stan,"Can't be
"
7,4,Cartman,"The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
"
7,4,Skeeter,"Hey I'm a little bit country
"
7,4,Randy,"And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH! 
"
7,4,Skeeter,"I'll be the muscle of America
"
7,4,Randy,"And me, I'll be the caring soul.
"
7,4,Together,"And when you put us together you get a nation with one goal 
To thrive and prosper, with a little country and rock and roll.
"
7,4,Randy,"Come on up here, everybody! 
"
7,4,Everybody,"We're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll
"
7,4,Stuart,"We can be a nation that believe in war,
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"And still tells the world that we don't. 
"
7,4,Everybody,"Let the flag for hypocrisy fly high from every pole 
Cuz we're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll.
"
7,4,Randy,"Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.
"
7,4,Skeeter,"We want to thank our guests, the pro-war people.  And the anti-war people. 
"
7,4,Stan,"What the hell are they doing now?
"
7,4,Kyle,"I-I don't know.
"
7,4,Everybody,"For the war, against, the war, WHO CARES?? One hundred episodes!   
"
7,4,Kyle,"I hate this town. I-I really really do.
"
7,5,Kyle,"...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. 
"
7,5,Principal Victoria,"Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski.
"
7,5,Mr. Mackey,"That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. 
"
7,5,Kyle,"Cool.
"
7,5,Principal Victoria,"All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman.  Eric Cartman? 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
"
7,5,Kids,"Jennifer Lopez?
"
7,5,Kyle,"No way.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Miss Lopez, come on out here. 
"
7,5,Principal Victoria,"Oh, Jesus Christ.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Oh, you mean this one? 
"
7,5,Cartman,"There we go, Saright?
"
7,5,Cartman,"That's a very pretty dress. 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez
"
7,5,Cartman,"Nono, Jeh-
"
7,5,Cartman,"Jeh-
"
7,5,Cartman,"Jeh
"
7,5,Cartman,"Jennifer Lopez
"
7,5,A Council Member,"Hahahahaha, oh my.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?
"
7,5,Cartman,"And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
"
7,5,Kyle,"It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
"
7,5,Kyle,"No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Is nice?
"
7,5,Kyle,"Stop it!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
"
7,5,Kenny,"(Woohoo!) 
"
7,5,Kyle,"Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
"
7,5,Kyle,"She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
"
7,5,Kenny,"(Heheehee, heheh yeahah)
"
7,5,Kyle,"Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
"
7,5,Cartman,"I agree. Those places are stupid.
"
7,5,Stan,"Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
"
7,5,Kyle,"God dammit! 
"
7,5,Cashier,"Welcome to Make Your Own Video. All set to rock and roll?
"
7,5,Cashier,"Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
"
7,5,Kyle,"Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!
"
7,5,Cartman,"All right all right, here's ten dollars! 
"
7,5,Kyle,"That's not what I meant!
"
7,5,Cashier,"All right, just come over here and stand in front of the green screen.  What kind of song do you want?
"
7,5,Cashier,"You know, I've seen a lot of videos here at the mall, and that was by far the best!
"
7,5,Cashier,"Hey, I've got a friend who's interning at a big record label in L.A. I'll send a copy on to him and maybe he'll get the bigwigs to see ya.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Can we go now, please?!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Yeah, I wanna leave.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Stop it, Cartman!
"
7,5,Cartman,"What?
"
7,5,BHI President,"She's fantiastic. Who is she? 
"
7,5,Aide 1,"Believe it or not, her name is Jennifer Lopez
"
7,5,Aide 2,"That makes sense. She reminds me of J-Lo.
"
7,5,BHI President,"Yeah, but she's younger and spicier.
"
7,5,Aide 2,"I don't think J-Lo would like it very much if we signed this new girl.
"
7,5,BHI President,"No, you're right. We're gonna have to fire J-Lo.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. 
"
7,5,Cartman,"What do they want?
"
7,5,Cartman,"S'awright?
"
7,5,Cartman,"What? What?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hello hello, are you still there?
"
7,5,Cartman,"You want to sign Ms. Lopez?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! 
"
7,5,Cartman,"There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow...  Tomorrow...  ""Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!""  ""You were wrong, Kyle!""  ""Nananananaaana!""  ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  ""Nananananaaana!"" ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  Awesommme. Yeeessss.

7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Yo, make it quick. I got a video shoot at two and a script reading at five. 
"
7,5,BHI President,"Yes, well uh, Ms. Lopes, we regret to inform you that, uh... we're dropping you from the label.
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"What? Oh no you di'n't!
"
7,5,Aide 1,"We wanna thank you for all your hard work and ...""talent"".
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"You can't drop me! I'm Jennifer Lopez! How can you drop me?!
"
7,5,BHI President,"Wu-well a very talented younger singer has come to our attention and, and the truth of the matter is her name happens to be Jennifer Lopez as well. And we really can't have two here at BHI Records.
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Who the hell is this other Jennifer Lopez?! Where 'os she come from?!
"
7,5,Aide 1,"Well, she lives in South Park, Colorado now, but uh I believe she originally from Mexico, just like you.
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"I don't come from no Mexico! I'm Puer'ah Rican!
"
7,5,BHI President,"Whatever. Look, it's nothing persona, we just think you need to move on.
"
7,5,Aide 2,"Bu- AND you're a mean-spirited bitch who spits on people who aren't rich and famous.
"
7,5,Reporter,"And sources say that the new film will star Ben Affleck.
"
7,5,Ben,"Huhuhuh, that's me.  How'd it go, baby?
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Terrible, Ben! Some girl in Colorado is trying to become the new Jennifer Lopez!  Shut up!

7,5,Cartman,"Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha!
"
7,5,Stan,"What are you gloating about?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to recored an album next week.
"
7,5,Kids in Class,"Wow, really?
"
7,5,Kyle,"No!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich.  And famous.
"
7,5,Mr. Garrison,"Olay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals.
"
7,5,Butters,"Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!

7,5,Mr. Mackey,"Here she comes! Here she comes!
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Okay! What smart-mouthed little punk-ass bitch has been saying they're the new Jennifer Lopez, huh?!
"
7,5,Principal Victoria,"J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"No! Shut up! If I find the ho who thinks she's taken my career from me, I'm gonna wring her pretty little neck!  So, nobody want's to fess up, huh? Too scared to talk?! You'd better remember, bitch, that I'll come and take you down if you ever say anythin' again!

"
7,5,Kyle,"Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Good.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Aw, God-dammit!

7,5,Cartman,"Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.

7,5,Cartman,"She's not here right now.

7,5,Ben,"Jenny? Yes, Jenny, eheh, it's me! Where are you? Please, I-I have to see her! 
"
7,5,Ben,"Jenny, I just can't stop thinking about you. 
"
7,5,Ben,"I've been meaning to write a song or a poem, but I have no talent.
"
7,5,Ben,"Will you just take a ride with me in my awesome car?
"
7,5,Cartman,"NO!
"
7,5,Cartman,"I'm not going out in his car.
"
7,5,Cartman,"I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework.
"
7,5,Cartman,"I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!
"
7,5,Ben,"Let's spend the whole day together!
"
7,5,Ben,"Jenny, I have to tell you something. I... I think I love you.
"
7,5,Ben,"But what?
"
7,5,Ben,"I still care for her. Maybe I always will. But... You just have so much more going on. Up here. 
"
7,5,Ben,"Jenny, can I kiss you?
"
7,5,Cartman,"NO!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Aw, God dammit!  Aww- awww, dude!

"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"You little snot-nose!  You ruin my career and now you're trying to steal my man?! 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Aww crap.
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"You'd better stay away from him! 
"
7,5,Cartman,"OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
"
7,5,Liane,"Oh dear.
"
7,5,Liane,"Oh dear.
Dr. Doctor:
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.
"
7,5,Cartman,"I told you this would happen. 
"
7,5,Kyle,"Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
"
7,5,Kyle,"I hate you. 
"
7,5,Liane,"Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.
"
7,5,Cartman,"EHAGH!  Moooooommmm!

7,5,Liane,"What is it, sweetie?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
"
7,5,Liane,"Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with youuu. 
"
7,5,Ben,"Good morning, baby.
"
7,5,Cartman,"You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
"
7,5,Cartman,"What? Oh- AWWW!  Ben Affleck's spooge!!
"
7,5,Ben,"Should we tell him the news?
"
7,5,Cartman,"What news?
"
7,5,Ben,"It's S'aright?
"
7,5,Cartman,"S'aright.
"
7,5,Ben,"We're getting married!!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Oh, balls!
"
7,5,Kyle,"Come in.  COME IN!! 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Guys, I need to talk to you.
"
7,5,Stan,"What's the matter?
"
7,5,Cartman,"I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
"
7,5,Kyle,"So stop doing it!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Stop doing what?
"
7,5,Kyle,"You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? 
"
7,5,Kyle,"Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!
"
7,5,Kyle,"I can see your lips moving!
"
7,5,Kyle,"See?! I just saw your lips move!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
"
7,5,Stan,"What's she doing?
"
7,5,Kyle,"Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
"
7,5,Stan,"I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!""
"
7,5,Stan,"Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?
"
7,5,Kyle,"YES, dude! 
"
7,5,Stan,"Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Out! 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Guys... Uh... Uh... 
"
7,5,Ben,"There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin' all over for you, baby!  Jenny? 
"
7,5,Aide 1,"Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on! 
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"So you're gettin' married, huh? 
"
7,5,Ben,"Don't you hurt her!
"
7,5,BHI President,"We'll sue you!
"
7,5,Kyle,"Oh Jesus.
"
7,5,Police Officer 1,"Freeze, leafblower! 
"
7,5,Aide 1,"Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists! 
"
7,5,Police Officer 2,"All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath.
"
7,5,Ben,"Jenny! Oh, I thought I was goin' lose you! Let's run away and get married tonight!
"
7,5,Aide 2,"Hey, she can't get married tonight, she has a recording session! 
"
7,5,Ben,"Our love is like rain!
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"That's what you said about me, asshole!
"
7,5,BHI President,"Get her out of here!
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Fuck you!
"
7,5,Police Officer 2,"Shut up, picante pants!
"
7,5,BHI President,"You're not?
"
7,5,Police Officer 2,"Who is Mitch Connor?
"
7,5,Kyle,"Oh no, no, nonono.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Stop. It.
"
7,5,Police Officer 2,"Well, looks like Mitch Connor has cashed in his last chips. 
"
7,5,Kyle,"Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?
"
7,5,Cartman,"I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
"
7,5,Kyle,"All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
"
7,5,Manager,"Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce go on.  .
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Ow. Look out, muffinhead!
"
7,5,Manager,"Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people.
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Get a what with who?
"
7,5,Manager,"Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?
"
7,5,Jennifer Lopez,"This is bullshit! How the fuck did I end up working in a La Taco?! I had six platinum records and I starred in five Hollywood movies!
"
7,5,Coworker,"Yeah. Me too.
"
7,6,Chris,"Yes?  Oh, hello, boys.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
"
7,6,Chris,"Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Awww, shit!
"
7,6,Stan,"All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. 
"
7,6,Chris,"I'll do that. Have fun, boys. 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?
"
7,6,Kyle,"Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.
"
7,6,Stan,"It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. 
"
7,6,Mrs. Farnickle,"Oh, hello there boys.
"
7,6,Stan,"Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?
"
7,6,Mrs. Farnickle,"Ohh, neighborhood detectives, huh? Well let me thi-oh yes! There is something!
"
7,6,Kyle,"Really?
"
7,6,Mrs. Farnickle,"Yes. Two days ago I put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool.  And later, when I went to get it, it was gone.
"
7,6,Cartman,"My God...
"
7,6,Stan,"Have you reported this to any other authorities?
"
7,6,Mrs. Farnickle,"Noo, but I think it's a perfect case for you kids.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
"
7,6,Stan,"We're on the case.
"
7,6,Cartman,"What have you got, Marsh?
"
7,6,Stan,"Detective McCormick found something interesting. 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Jesus, we're too late.
"
7,6,Kyle,"I think we can piece this case together now.
"
7,6,Mrs. Farnickle,"My pie tin! Oooh, but what happened to the pie?
"
7,6,Kyle,"Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
"
7,6,Mr. Farnickle,"Well, what do you think happened, little detectives?
"
7,6,Stan,"You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. 
"
7,6,Kyle,"Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!
"
7,6,Stan,"His plan was to use a hammer.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. 
"
7,6,Stan,"Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. 
"
7,6,Kyle,"Then saw off the arms and legs. 
"
7,6,Cartman,"The torso he would dump into the lake. 
"
7,6,Stan,"The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. 
"
7,6,Cartman,"And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
"
7,6,Kyle,"But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Looks like the game is over, old man! 
"
7,6,Mrs. Farnickle,"Oh my God, what kind of television have you kids been watching??
"
7,6,Stan,"Just the news.
"
7,6,Mrs. Farnickle,"All right, all right, you you boys run along now.
"
7,6,Stan,"Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.
"
7,6,Mrs. Farnickle,"Fine, here, just go! 
"
7,6,Stan,"Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar! 
"
7,6,Kyle,"We're in business!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington
"
7,6,Liane,"Boys, you have a little visitor. 
"
7,6,Girl,"Is this the South Park Crime Unit?
"
7,6,The Boys,"Ah! Oh. 
"
7,6,Stan,"Yes it is!
"
7,6,Girl,"I lost my dolly.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!
"
7,6,Kyle,"Do you kow where your doll is?
"
7,6,Girl,"If I knew where it was, it wouldn't be lost.
"
7,6,Stan,"All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.
"
7,6,Sarah,"She has curly blonde hair. And a red dress. And a turned-up nose. And a blue bow in her hair.
"
7,6,Stan,"You got it, Ken? 
"
7,6,Kyle,"All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
"
7,6,Stan,"Put that away, dude! 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.
"
7,6,Cartman,"No sign of forced entry.
"
7,6,Kyle,"But the window isn't locked.
"
7,6,Stan,"Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
"
7,6,Cartman,"We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. 
"
7,6,A Boy,"All right, let's do this by the books! McDonnell,  give me smears of all the places the doll used to be!  Mitchell,  run a tap on the phone! 
"
7,6,Stan,"Hey, kid, what are you doing?
"
7,6,The Boy,"Agent Tucker, FBI! And you?
"
7,6,Stan,"Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
"
7,6,Tucker,"...Not anymore, you're not!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
"
7,6,Tucker,"Can't we? You guys are playing Detective. We're playing FBI. That gives us jurisdiction over you!
"
7,6,Stan,"Aw crap!
"
7,6,Tucker,"I want choppers on the roof ready to go! 
"
7,6,Kyle,"Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
"
7,6,Tucker,"Good. Then you can help us by telling me everything you know.
"
7,6,Stan,"Son of a bitch stupid FBI!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.
"
7,6,Stan,"No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
7,6,Kyle,"Yeah, but how?
"
7,6,Stan,"We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!
"
7,6,Butters,"Ah, I was at home.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! 
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Awww, don't be so mean. Butters is our friend, huh?) 
"
7,6,Stan,"They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.
"
7,6,Cartman,"You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)
"
7,6,Cartman,"You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Aww, it's okay, little fella.)
"
7,6,Butters,"Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. 
"
7,6,Butters,"How do I do that?
"
7,6,Cartman,"You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
"
7,6,Butters,"Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
"
7,6,Cartman,"Stop playing games!
"
7,6,Butters,"I'm not playing. I really don't know!
"
7,6,Cartman,"That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.
"
7,6,Kyle,"How... do you make semen come out?
"
7,6,Cartman,"I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
"
7,6,Stan,"It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Really?
"
7,6,Kyle,"Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!
"
7,6,Butters,"No!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Follow me to the bathroom. 
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Aw, it's okay, kid. It's not going to hurt.) 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
"
7,6,Butters,"My weiner??
"
7,6,Cartman,"Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!
"
7,6,Butters,"Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Well pull harder!
"
7,6,Butters,"...ow... Ow... It's not workin'
"
7,6,Cartman,"Try doin' it faster
"
7,6,Butters,"Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'
"
7,6,Cartman,"Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
"
7,6,Butters,"NOOooo!
"
7,6,Cartman,"The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
"
7,6,Butters,"Okay!!
"
7,6,Stan,"Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Let's go! 
"
7,6,Butters,"...ow... Ow!
"
7,6,Fosse,"Huhuh, Okay Ms., Ms. Jones, heh, me and Doctor... Flick here just need to... check your vagina. 
"
7,6,Bill,"That's gay. 
"
7,6,Fosse,"Yeah, that's gay. 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Kyle! 
"
7,6,Kyle,"What?  What??
"
7,6,Cartman,"I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!
"
7,6,Kyle,"They've got the doll! 
"
7,6,Stan,"Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down! 
"
7,6,Fosse,"Huh huh who is it?!
"
7,6,Stan,"South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
"
7,6,Fosse,"They're playing Detective. 
"
7,6,Bill,"That's gay. 
"
7,6,Fosse,"You're gay! 
"
7,6,Kyle,"What do we do now?
"
7,6,Stan,"I don't know.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. 
"
7,6,Stan,"Dude, we just can't tell on them.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Why not?
"
7,6,Kyle,"Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
"
7,6,Fosse,"Detectives!  If you don't get out of here, we're gonna rip the doll's head off!
"
7,6,Bill,"Yeah.
"
7,6,Fosse,"We were playing gynecologists and now we're playing criminals
"
7,6,Bill,"That's gay.
"
7,6,Fosse,"We're gay.
"
7,6,Stan,"Jesus! They're gonna kill her!
"
7,6,Kyle,"We've got to do something.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
"
7,6,Tucker,"Attention! You in the house!  This is Agent Tucker with the FBI! We have you surrounded. Sort of.
"
7,6,Stan,"Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Yeah! This was our hot lead!
"
7,6,Tucker,"And you did a great job leading us here. Now you just stay out of our way!  The gig is up, Fosse! Bring out the doll! Or we'll tell on you!
"
7,6,Stan,"We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
"
7,6,Tucker,"No you're not.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
"
7,6,Tucker,"Time out, kid! We say you can't charge the front door, and you have to obey what the FBI says! That's the rules!
"
7,6,Stan,"Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
"
7,6,Tucker,"Yes it does so! 
"
7,6,Kyle,"...Grrrr!!! 
"
7,6,Kenny,"(What do we do now?)
"
7,6,Stan,"We go get the doll ourselves.
"
7,6,Kyle,"But they said we can't charge the front door.
"
7,6,Stan,"That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
"
7,6,Tucker,"Come on guys. You don't wanna hurt that doll.
"
7,6,Bill,"Huhuh.  Oh crap, they're coming in the back!  That's gay. 
"
7,6,Stan,"Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!
"
7,6,Fosse,"No you didn't!
"
7,6,Stan,"Did so!
"
7,6,Fosse,"No, 'cause I got... special wizard armor on.
"
7,6,Kyle,"We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!
"
7,6,Cartman,"All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!
"
7,6,Fosse,"Oooh, they got me!  Whooaaa, whooaaa, whooaaa. 
"
7,6,Bill,"rr uh rr uh, uhhhh. 
"
7,6,Fosse,"We're dead.
"
7,6,Bill,"That's gay.
"
7,6,Stan,"We got it.
"
7,6,Stan,"Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?
"
7,6,Sarah,"My dollie! 
"
7,6,Cartman,"We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.
"
7,6,Sarah's Mom,"Well you boys are little heroes. I'm going to call the police department and let them know what brave little detectives you are! 
"
7,6,Dawson,"Hello there little crime stoppers, I'm Lieutenant Dawson with the Park County Police. I heard you did a great job finding Sarah Peterson's doll.
"
7,6,Stan,"We do what we can, sir.
"
7,6,Dawson,"W-hell, that's fantastic, kids. And for all your terrific sleuth-solving, I'm hereby making you all Junior Detectives. 
"
7,6,Kyle,"Wow! 
"
7,6,Dawson,"That means you boys are now an official part of the department.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Kewl!
"
7,6,Dawson,"All right, so ready for your first assignment?
"
7,6,Stan,"Sure.
"
7,6,Dawson,"Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567 Mala Vista. The operators are probably armed to the hilt with illegal weapons. I want you to get down there and see what you can find!
"
7,6,Kyle,"Ah... a a a meth lab?
"
7,6,Dawson,"I don't want any problems. Just take them down by the books. Now get over there; the mayor's all over my ass on this one!  On, and deputies: you screw this up and I'll have you working graveyard shift behind a desk! Move it! 
"
7,6,Kyle,"What is a meth lab, anyway?
"
7,6,Stan,"I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. 
"
7,6,Stan,"Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?
"
7,6,Kyle,"Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. 
"
7,6,Man 1,"You die, pigs!  You want to die, huh? 
"
7,6,Man 3,"You won't take us alive! 
"
7,6,Man 5,"So long, coppers!  Oh, shit! 
"
7,6,Stan,"Damn.
"
7,6,Dawson,"One UPS vehicle valued at twenty-five thousand dollars, one civilian vehicle valued at sixteen thousand, the second floor of the post office AND a coffee shop valued at sixteen thousand! The mayor's gonna have my ass!
"
7,6,Stan,"Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
"
7,6,Dawson,"You got careless! Now, I don't know how they do things down at that dog-and-pony show they call the Fourth Grade, but here we have rules! Jesus, we don't have guys to question now, because you killed them all!
"
7,6,Kyle,"We're sorry.
"
7,6,Dawson,"One more slip-up like that and I'll have your badges! You hear me?! Now hit the showers!
"
7,6,Officer 1,"Well well well, if it isn't the supercops. 
"
7,6,Officer 2,"Hey Murphy, think they'll let me borrow their G.I. Joes?
"
7,6,Officer 4,"Come on, you guys. Leave them alone.
"
7,6,Murphy,"Relax, Hopkins!  All fun and games, right?  Soho, tell us, rookies, you ah... find yourself a little bonus in that house??
"
7,6,Cartman,"Uh bonus?
"
7,6,Murphy,"Come on! We all skim a little off the top. Oh. Or are you too good for that?  So you think you're gonna waltz in here and clean up the system. Is that it?
"
7,6,Stan,"We just wanna be junior detectives.
"
7,6,Murphy,"LOOK, we all work hard! And we deserve more than the thirty-thousand a year we get paid! So what if we take in a little on the side?
"
7,6,Officer 2,"Yeah! Who the hell are you to say that?!
"
7,6,Hopkins,"I said, back off Murphy!
"
7,6,Murphy,"Why don't you and your rookie friends make us
"
7,6,Officer 2,"That's right. Come on, bring it!
"
7,6,Officer 3,"Yeah, let's go! Come on, bring it!
"
7,6,Dawson,"What the hell is the problem here??
"
7,6,Murphy,"No problem, sir. No problem at all.
"
7,6,Dawson,"Then hit the showers, all of ya!
"
7,6,Kyle,"Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Me neither.
"
7,6,Stan,"It'll get better, guys.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Better how, dude?
"
7,6,Stan,"Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
"
7,6,Kyle,"We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.
"
7,6,Stan,"I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
"
7,6,Cartman,"Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!
"
7,6,Stan,"You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Awwwwrrr-auugh. 
"
7,6,Liane,"Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.
"
7,6,Cartman,"We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
"
7,6,Liane,"Well you should've called Mommy.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.
"
7,6,Liane,"Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?
"
7,6,Cartman,"Okay. 
"
7,6,Butters,"Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Butters?
"
7,6,Butters,"Yes?
"
7,6,Cartman,"Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
"
7,6,Butters,"Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Well, keep tryin', Butters.
"
7,6,Butters,"Okay.  Ow. Ooww!
"
7,6,Mr. Garrison,"And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America.  Uh, boys!  Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class?
"
7,6,Kyle,"Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.
"
7,6,Mr. Garrison,"Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!
"
7,6,Cartman,"A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?
"
7,6,Mr. Garrison,"Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?!  That's what I thought! Now pay attention!  Okay, children, now, the biggest fatass was an old skank by the name of-
"
7,6,Dawson,"Marsh! Broflovski! McCormick! Cartman! In my office! 
"
7,6,The Boys,"Eeagh!
"
7,6,Dawson,"Looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg. They found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Un oh...
"
7,6,Dawson,"The operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in Inglewood. They're all cop killers, so I'm sending you in undercover. 
"
7,6,Kyle,"Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
"
7,6,Dawson,"What?! Now you listen to me! I'm givin' you one last chance! You're good cops, but you let your emotions get in the way! And your little ""shoot first ask questions later"" technique has no place in this century! Now you get down to that strip joint and you do it by the books, you got it?! The mayor is on my ass and blablablah! 
"
7,6,Murphy,"So, what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant?
"
7,6,Stan,"Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.
"
7,6,Murphy,"Maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our... bonus money.
"
7,6,Kyle,"No. 
"
7,6,Officer 2,"They're lying.
"
7,6,Murphy,"They're dead!
"
7,6,Kyle,"Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Woohoo!!) 
"
7,6,Stripper,"Would you like a dance?
"
7,6,Stan,"No thanks.
"
7,6,Stripper,"Dance?  Anyone like a dance?
"
7,6,DJ,"Well all right, guests, put your hands together. Be sure to tip the dancers. And now, come on, let's hear it for Candy!
"
7,6,Bouncer,"Whoa whoa, what the hell are you kids doin' in here? This isn't an appropriate place for children
"
7,6,Stripper,"Dance? Anyone like a dance?
"
7,6,Kyle,"Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.
"
7,6,Stripper,"Oh, really? Let's go see.
"
7,6,Owner,"All right, so we'll have to start havin' the McCormicks make our meth again and-
"
7,6,Bouncer,"Hey Gino, these kids say they know you.
"
7,6,Gino,"What? Ha-I don't know no kids.
"
7,6,Bouncer,"I didn't think so. All right, you kids-
"
7,6,Gino,"Hey wait a minute. These kids might be just what we need to get our drugs past the security at DIA. How would you like to join our family?
"
7,6,Tall Goon,"Yo Gino, I know I've seen these kids before, man. These kids are 5-0!
"
7,6,Gino,"What?
"
7,6,Tall Goon,"These kids are cops, man! 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Bang bang bang... 
"
7,6,"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","Bang bang bang... 
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Pakew! Pakew!)
"
7,6,Cartman,"Kenny, it doesn't go ""Pakew! Pakew!"", it goes ""BANG BANG BANG!!"" 
"
7,6,Dawson,"God damnit! Those junior detectives and their heroicly reckless ways! Murphy! Jenkins! Hopkins! Get in there! 
"
7,6,Stripper,"Dance??? Anybody like a dance??? 
"
7,6,Hopkins,"Freeze! South Park detectives!  Great job, boys. You found the meth boss!
"
7,6,Gino,"Detective Murphy! Jenkins! Uh what the hell are you doing? We had a deal.
"
7,6,Hopkins,"A deal?
"
7,6,Murphy,"That's right. We're partners in the drug business. Everything was fine until these ""supercops"" joined the force. 
"
7,6,Jenkins,"Now we've gotta kill you all.
"
7,6,Hopkins,"Boys! Down! 
"
7,6,DJ,"Huh alright guys, put your hands together, a lot of shootin' and killin' goin' on, but be sure to tip your waitress let's hear it for Rebecca.
"
7,6,Dawson,"Christ! Those junior detectives have no regard for the law! 
"
7,6,Lead FBI agent,"Get me a hard line to the phone! And I want choppers on the roof!
"
7,6,Dawson,"Who the hell are you??
"
7,6,Lead FBI agent,"Agent Fields, FBI!
"
7,6,Dawson,"Hey, I'm in charge of this investigation.
"
7,6,Fields,"Not anymore, you're not.
"
7,6,Dawson,"But that's not fair!
"
7,6,Fields,"Is so! Is so! 
"
7,6,Jenkins,"Sorry, Detective Hopkins. We can't let anybody know about our partnership.
"
7,6,Gino,"That's right. We split it all, fifty-fifty!
"
7,6,Murphy,"That's right.  I think we'll take a hundred percent now.
"
7,6,Jenkins,"Huhuh yeah. Sorry, Gino, but in business like this, sometimes partnerships need to end.
"
7,6,Murphy,"That's right.  Sometimes partnerships need to end.  Well, supercops, looks like I'll be taking in all the money now. I'm in business alone. And that means that the only person I can't trust... is myself. 
"
7,6,Hopkins,"It looks like Murphy and Jenkins got what they deserved. If it weren't for you boys, we would have never cleaned up the department.
"
7,6,Dawson,"All right, detectives, let's get one thing straight! I do not agree with your methods! You're uncontrolled, and you're negligent! But by God you get the job done. Congratulations!
"
7,6,Stan,"Thanks.
"
7,6,Dawson,"I'm probably going to regret this, but, well, I'm promoting you to full detectives. There'll be lots of action, and that big paycheck you've always wanted. 
"
7,6,Stan,"...I think I have a better idea.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.
"
7,6,Stan,"Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Certainly.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.
"
7,6,Butters,"Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
"
7,6,Cartman,"You did?
"
7,6,Butters,"Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
"
7,6,Kyle,"That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
"
7,7,Stan,"Wow, dude.
"
7,7,Cartman,"Man, Indians have it good, huh?
"
7,7,Randy,"Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.
"
7,7,Native American Chief,"Welcome to the Three Feathers Casino. I'm your host, Chief Runs With Premise. Please try your luck at one of our many games.
"
7,7,Cartman,"All right, let's go! 
"
7,7,Runs With Premise,"Halt.  I am afraid minors cannot go onto the casino floor.
"
7,7,Cartman,"I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!
"
7,7,Runs With Premise,"You kids can enjoy our Native American Comedy Club.
"
7,7,Gerald,"All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club? 
"
7,7,Randy,"All right, time to win some money!
"
7,7,Gerald,"Oh yeah! blackjack table!
"
7,7,Blackjack Dealer,"Welcome to the blackjack table. May luck run through you, like the spirit of the buffalo.
"
7,7,Sheila,"Gerald, this is ten dollars a hand!
"
7,7,Gerald,"Relax, sweetie  I know how to count cards.
"
7,7,Sheila,"Well I don't wanna play here!
"
7,7,Sharon,"Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.
"
7,7,Randy,"Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. 
"
7,7,Gerald,"All right, time to show these people how to gamble!
"
7,7,Announcer,"Welcome to the Three Feathers Comedy Club. Please put your hands together for Johnny Manymoons! 
"
7,7,Kyle,"What is Native American comedy, anyway?
"
7,7,Manymoons,"Thank you, thank you. Bear walked into a bar. Bear said to Deer, ""May I please... have a drink?"" And so Deer said to Bear, ""Why the big paws?"" 
"
7,7,Audience,"Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! 
"
7,7,Manymoons,"Many moons ago, Pony and Eagle walked up to Coyote. Pony said to Coyote, ""I am very mad at Eagle. Will you yell at him for me?"" Coyote said to Pony, ""Why can you not yell yourself?"" And Pony replied, ""Because I am a little horse."" 
"
7,7,Audience,"Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
"
7,7,Randy,"How's it goin', Gerald?
"
7,7,Gerald,"Ohh, not so good.
"
7,7,Randy,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.
"
7,7,Gerald,"Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand.
"
7,7,Randy,"Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??
"
7,7,Gerald,"I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.
"
7,7,Randy,"Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!
"
7,7,Gerald,"Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!
"
7,7,Randy,"Where did you get that kind of money??
"
7,7,Gerald,"The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.
"
7,7,Blackjack Dealer,"Dealer, twenty one.  Sorry.
"
7,7,Gerald,"That's it. I'm destitute.  Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup!  Wha- what's in the cup?
"
7,7,Randy,"Just six quarters!
"
7,7,Gerald,"Oh God. Oh Jesus.
"
7,7,Blackjack Dealer,"Thank you for playing at Three Feathers. May your life be filled with the song of the sparrow.
"
7,7,Gerald,"Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!
"
7,7,Gerald,"How am I going to tell my family?  How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house? 
"
7,7,Sheila,"There's daddy!
"
7,7,Gerald,"Oh, Jesus. 
"
7,7,Sheila,"Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.
"
7,7,Kyle,"Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.
"
7,7,Gerald,"What, What did you say?
"
7,7,Kyle,"I said I wanna leave.
"
7,7,Gerald,"Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave! 
"
7,7,Kyle,"What?? No, no, I mean, I-
"
7,7,Gerald,"No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!
"
7,7,Sheila,"Gerald, what are you talking about?
"
7,7,Gerald,"Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling the moving company right now! 
"
7,7,Cartman,"Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. 
"
7,7,Sharon,"What's wrong with Gerald?
"
7,7,Randy,"He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.
"
7,7,Sharon,"What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?
"
7,7,Randy,"They don't care. 
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Look at them! Small-minded idiots pouring their life-savings away!
"
7,7,Elder 1,"Their cash flows out of them like diarrhea from the buffalo.
"
7,7,Elder 2,"Yes, but we have milked this simple mountain folk almost dry. If we really want to see cash flow, we need to bring in city people from Denver.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Yeessss. It is time for us to implement our plan.  A superhighway, built from Denver right to our casino!
"
7,7,Aide 1,"And what do we do about the small town of South Park that lies in the highway's way?
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Simple. We buy it, and we demolish it! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
"
7,7,Elders,"Ha ha ha ha!
"
7,7,Mayor McDaniels,"And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway.
"
7,7,Randy,"But how can they do that?!
"
7,7,Mayor McDaniels,"The Native Americans have purchased the land from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership.
"
7,7,Jimbo,"Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.
"
7,7,Mayor McDaniels,"The Native Americans bought the bank.
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"Oh my God.
"
7,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes.
"
7,7,Randy,"No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves! 
"
7,7,Chef,"Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park! 
"
7,7,Randy,"How much do we have to raise, Mayor?
"
7,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Three hundred thousand dollars. 
"
7,7,Randy,"Ohhh, never mind. 
"
7,7,Butters,"How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
"
7,7,Cartman,"Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
"
7,7,Kyle,"Native Americans. 
"
7,7,Stan,"Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. 
"
7,7,Stan,"We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!
"
7,7,The boys,"Yeah!
"
7,7,Alex,"Yeah, this is our town!
"
7,7,Stan,"We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
"
7,7,"Kyle, Butters, Tweek","Yeah!
"
7,7,Cartman,"That's right!
"
7,7,Butters,"Yeah, ahh, that's right!
"
7,7,Alex,"Yeah, we're a team!
"
7,7,Stan,"We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! 
"
7,7,Cartman,"Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?
"
7,7,Stan,"We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
"
7,7,Butters,"Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? 
"
7,7,Kyle,"Dog parade?
"
7,7,Butters,"Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!
"
7,7,Kyle,"How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
"
7,7,Butters,"Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.
"
7,7,Stan,"Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!
"
7,7,Butters,"Oh... 
"
7,7,Cartman,"Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
"
7,7,Sheila,"Oh, Gerald, I, I can't watch!
"
7,7,Randy,"How can you do this to people?
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"We're sorry. But if we do not build a superhighway, our casino might stop seeing profits.
"
7,7,Randy,"There's more to life than profits!
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Well like what?
"
7,7,Randy,"Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff. 
"
7,7,Chris,"Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well.
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah.  So long, South Park.
"
7,7,Stan,"Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
"
7,7,Chris,"A dog parade? 
"
7,7,Stan,"No!
"
7,7,Randy,"Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.
"
7,7,Stan,"I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
"
7,7,Kyle,"The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.
"
7,7,Sheila,"Boys, that's ridiculous.
"
7,7,Stan,"Look, we- we've got nothing to lose.
"
7,7,Chef,"What do you guys think?
"
7,7,Jimbo,"It's a long shot.
"
7,7,Randy,"Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.
"
7,7,Runs With Premise,"The residents of South Park had hoped to raise three hundred thousand dollars. but in the end managed to raise only ten. The loss of their town may be imminent for the poor people of South Park.  Awww, I think I'm going to cuwhy.
"
7,7,Two Elders,"HA ha ha ha! HA ha ha ha!
"
7,7,Randy,"All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. 
"
7,7,Stan,"Dad.  Good luck.
"
7,7,Randy,"It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone! 
"
7,7,Runs With Premise,"What are they doing?
"
7,7,Randy,"We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  On thirty one black! 
"
7,7,Runs With Premise,"Impossible!
"
7,7,Stan,"Come on! Come on! 
"
7,7,Runs With Premise,"Thirty one. Black. 
"
7,7,Townsfolk,"Yeah! All right! Woohoo! Oh we did it! We did it! Oh my God! Oh this is amazing!
"
7,7,Runs With Premise,"No... NOOO! 
"
7,7,Alex,"South Park is saved. 
"
7,7,Mr. Mackey,"We have plenty enough to save our town now!
"
7,7,Gerald,"Yeah! But wait.  Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million! 
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"We can save the town and be super-rich!
"
7,7,Randy,"Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!
"
7,7,Gerald,"Let it ride!!
"
7,7,Townsfolk,"Woohoo! Yeah! 
"
7,7,Kyle,"What the hell are they doing??
"
7,7,Jimbo,"Let's go thirty one! Let's see it! 
"
7,7,Roulette Dealer,"Two, red. You lose.
"
7,7,Townsfolk,"AWWWWWWW!!
"
7,7,Randy,"Dammit!
"
7,7,Runs With Premise,"Hmmm! 
"
7,7,Stan,"They, they had it! They freakin' had it!
"
7,7,Stan,"You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
"
7,7,Randy,"Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.
"
7,7,Stan,"A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!
"
7,7,Randy,"Stan? Okay?
"
7,7,Stan,"What???
"
7,7,Randy,"All right? Stan? Okay?
"
7,7,Stan,"You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! 
"
7,7,Randy,"Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?!  Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native Americans.
"
7,7,Elder 2,"There you are, sir. There's the check for your home. Just sign here, and here.
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're officially homeless.
"
7,7,Mr. Slave,"Jesus! Jesus Christ!
"
7,7,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!
"
7,7,Randy,"Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes.
"
7,7,Elder 3,"There you go. Have a nice day. 
"
7,7,Stan,"Come on, you guys! This is our town!
"
7,7,Mr. Mackey,"It's over, Stanley. What else can we do?
"
7,7,Stan,"We can stay. And fight.
"
7,7,Cartman,"Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
"
7,7,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
7,7,Alex,"Yeah! They don't own our town! We do!
"
7,7,Chef,"I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics.
"
7,7,Randy,"It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.
"
7,7,Stan,"Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! 
"
7,7,Cartman,"You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! 
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Get out of our way!
"
7,7,Stan,"No! We won't let you destroy our town!
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Boys. It isn't your town anymore.
"
7,7,Stan,"Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.
"
7,7,Elder 1,"Well your way of life is about to change, little boys. Now move! 
"
7,7,Kyle,"You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
"
7,7,A Driver,"And what are four little boys going to do to stop us, huh? 
"
7,7,Townsfolk,"We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so lohh-oo-ohh-oo-ong
Both of us knowing...
Love Is A Battlefield
"
7,7,Stan,"This land is not for sale.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Dammit! I thought you said they were dealt with!
"
7,7,Elder 1,"They were!
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money!
"
7,7,Principal Victoria,"Filthy bastard Native American money!
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"Uh oh, right, huh. Sorry about that.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"This isn't over! 
"
7,7,Jimbo,"We'll never give up! You bastards!
"
7,7,Alex,"Yeah! South Park is ours.
"
7,7,Mr. Mackey,"But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever.
"
7,7,Randy,"We can stand here as long as it takes. 
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"What is the state of our people?
"
7,7,Elder 2,"Last night I spoke with the spirit of the bear, and Bear said that if we do not build our highway soon, our investors may soon sell off their shares of the new casino.
"
7,7,Elder 1,"Yes, and Eagle says the cumulative shared market loss on the revenue of the new casino drops fifteen percent every day.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Then we must force the South Park people off their petty land.
"
7,7,Elder 1,"But they are determined and proud. And the spirit of the wind has stated that if we use force, it could be a publicity nightmare, further hurting our net assets.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"I already have a plan how we can force them off our land... sneakily.  We're going to give them...  blankets. 
"
7,7,Elder 1,"Blankets?
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Yes. We will present the blankets as a peace offering. But what the round-eyes will not know is that the blankets are infected with SARS.  They will all get SARS! And then SARS will run through their town like a buffalo. Now I need your help getting the SARS onto the blankets.  Okay, bring them in!  Let's see how South Park deals with this!  Everyone grab a Chinese person and rub them on a blanket.  Make sure you rub them all over. Get the SARS nice and deep in there. 
"
7,7,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in chilly South Park, Colorado, where the residents are entering the third day of their sit-in to try and stop Native Americans from building a superhighway through their town. The temperature is low, but spirits are pretty low, too. 
"
7,7,Randy,"What do they want?
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"We're not moving, assfaces!
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Free blanket?  Though I know we have differences, we believe a compromise can be reached. In the meantime, it hurts us to see you all on television sitting in the cold. Will you not take this offering as a gesture of goodwill?
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"You had me at ""free blanket."" 
"
7,7,Elders,"Free blanket? Free blanket? Free blanket...
"
7,7,Field Reporter,"Tom, it now looks as if the Native Americans are handing out blankets as a sign of goodwill towards the South Park people. What an incredible display of compassion. I certainly hope there's nothing sinister behind it.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Please. As a token of good faith.
"
7,7,Randy,"You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"It is only a blanket, Mister Marsh.
"
7,7,Randy,"Well, thanks. 
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Oh. You're welcome.
"
7,7,Field Reporter,"Tom, it's Tuesday morning now, and the outbreak of SARS in South Park has reached epic proportions.  The entire town has been quarantined by the federal government, nobody allowed in our out, which means, nobody can come to our aid.  It appears this town, and this reporter, are done for. Coming up next, choosing the right hair conditioner. What you don't know about hair care products could be costing you a bundle.
"
7,7,Stan,"It's all right, dad.
"
7,7,Randy,"How's your... mother?
"
7,7,Stan,"She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer. 
"
7,7,Randy,"It's cool on my tongue.
"
7,7,Stan,"You're gonna be all right.
"
7,7,Randy,"Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.
"
7,7,Stan,"No, Dad, NO.
"
7,7,Randy,"Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. 
"
7,7,Stan,"What can I do?
"
7,7,Randy,"You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.
"
7,7,Stan,"Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!
"
7,7,Randy,"The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO! 
"
7,7,Wise Man,"What?
"
7,7,Stan,"Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-
"
7,7,Wise Man,"Your coming was foretold to me. You've come to save our people. Come in.  Watch the cats.
"
7,7,Stan,"Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?
"
7,7,Wise Man,"Me?? Huh, no. I am just a guide. Sit down.  You must find the answer yourself, by taking an inward journey. 
"
7,7,Stan,"An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.
"
7,7,Wise Man,"Let the voices of our ancestors show you the way.  Breathe. Breathe from the bag of visions. 
"
7,7,Stan,"Ah! Oh, dude!
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"How much longer must we wait for our superhighway??
"
7,7,Elder 1,"SARS has spread through the entire town of South Park, Chief Runs with Premise. Their wills will break soon.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Then I suppose we must be patient.
"
7,7,Woman,"Runs with Premise, come quickly!
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"What is the matter, wife?
"
7,7,Woman,"It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Premise Running Thin, what is the matter?
"
7,7,Woman,"He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"No! I told you not to touch them!
"
7,7,Premise Running Thin,"Papa. Papa...
"
7,7,Medicine Man,"I have given him herbs from the desert plant and water from the cactus of life. But nothing seems to be working.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"This would never have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away! No more waiting around! Tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan! Shock and Awe!
"
7,7,Randy,"Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
"
7,7,Stan,"Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
"
7,7,Randy,"Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! 
"
7,7,Kyle,"Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
"
7,7,Alex,"Thanks to you, we're all safe now, Stan. 
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"Now, I will blow your weak, SARS-infested bodies off the Earth!  What the?  Wait a minute.  Stop! Stop!  Your, your SARS. Where did it go?
"
7,7,Randy,"We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"My son... Premise Running Thin has the SARS as well.  You... you can cure him?
"
7,7,Elder 1,"It is amazing. All our plants and herbs failed to heal him, but your people's remedy brings the spirit of the buffalo back into his heart. Perhaps there are many things we can learn from your way of life.
"
7,7,Randy,"We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.
"
7,7,Runs with Premise,"You have cured Premise Running Thin. In return, I shall give you all five dollars credit at the casino.  All right, all right, I will not build a superhighway through your town. And you can all have your homes back.
"
7,7,Townsfolk,"All right! Yeah!  Woohoo!
"
7,7,Alex,"Well, I guess we all learned that South Park is more than just a town. It's a community that nobody can split up.
"
7,7,Stan,"Dude, who the hell are you?
"
7,7,Alex,"Alex. Alex Glick. I got to come on and do the guest voice thingy.
"
7,7,Kyle,"What?! Get the hell out of here!
"
7,7,Alex,"Hi Mom! Hi Dad! Hi Joe!
"
7,8,Stan,"Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
"
7,8,Cartman,"What? Tell us?
"
7,8,Stan,"So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
"
7,8,Cartman,"Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!
"
7,8,Stan,"I know!
"
7,8,Kenny,"(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)
"
7,8,Stan,"Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.
"
7,8,Kyle,"Hey dudes. 
"
7,8,Cartman,"What a dork!
"
7,8,Kyle,"What?
"
7,8,Cartman,"Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! 
"
7,8,Kyle,"Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.
"
7,8,Stan,"You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.
"
7,8,Cartman,"Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. 
"
7,8,Stan,"Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
"
7,8,Cartman,"We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
"
7,8,Kenny,"(That's the truth.)
"
7,8,Stan,"Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! 
"
7,8,Singers (Widelife),"You... came into my life... and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.
It's true. You bring out the best in me.
When you are around, when you are around, all things just keep getting better.
It keeps getting better. Life keeps getting better and better (All things just keep getting better).
"
7,8,Announcer,"Coming up on HBC, it's Queer Eye for the Straight Guy!
"
7,8,Carson,"We have got to get you some tighter-fitting shirts!
"
7,8,Announcer,"Then it's Boy Meets Boy, followed by Will and Grace, and then, the Love Boat... with Men.
"
7,8,Sheila,"My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.
"
7,8,Gerald,"Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. 
"
7,8,Kyle,"Hi Mom, Hi Dad!
"
7,8,Gerald,"HAAAAAA!!!  Kyle! What's happened to you??
"
7,8,Kyle,"I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 
"
7,8,Gerald,"Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! 
"
7,8,Sharon,"Oh hi Gerald, Sheila.
"
7,8,Gerald,"Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.
"
7,8,Sharon,"Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.
"
7,8,Gerald,"Oh, is the game on or something? 
"
7,8,Randy,"Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!! 
"
7,8,Other Men,"Geraaald! Hi Gerald.
"
7,8,Stuart,"Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on.
"
7,8,Gerald,"Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? 
"
7,8,Randy,"Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.
"
7,8,Gerald,"What's that?
"
7,8,Skeeter,"Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.
"
7,8,Stuart,"Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.
"
7,8,Randy,"It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?
"
7,8,Sharon,"Don't our men look
"
7,8,Linda,"Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best.
"
7,8,Sheila,"It is?
"
7,8,Sharon,"Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures.
"
7,8,Linda,"And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.
"
7,8,Sarah,"My Steven shaved his chest and his balls. OOOO, I love it!
"
7,8,Sharon,"And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever.
"
7,8,Sheila,"I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...
"
7,8,Stan,"Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
"
7,8,Cartman,"That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
"
7,8,Kenny,"(Woohoo!!)
"
7,8,Stan,"All right. Let's work it!  What the...?
"
7,8,Butters,"Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classies.
"
7,8,Connor,"Okay, sweetums. 
"
7,8,Clyde,"Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out! 
"
7,8,A Boy,"Hey dudes. 
"
7,8,Stan,"Hey Craig.
"
7,8,Craig,"You guys look pretty gay.
"
7,8,Kyle,"Thanks.
"
7,8,Craig,"Not as gay as us, though.
"
7,8,Cartman,"Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!
"
7,8,Craig,"Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay!
"
7,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
"
7,8,Chef,"What's all this fightin' about, children?!
"
7,8,Stan,"These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
"
7,8,Chef,"Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too!
"
7,8,Stan,"Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!
"
7,8,Chef,"No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!
"
7,8,Stan,"We're metrosexual!!
"
7,8,Craig,"Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! 
"
7,8,Cartman,"GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!! 
"
7,8,Kyle,"Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.
"
7,8,Chef,"Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"All right children, let's take our seats.
"
7,8,Class,"Good morning Mr. Garrison. 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, uh d-don't you all look nice.
"
7,8,Timmy,"Oooo, Timmy. 
"
7,8,Stan,"Dude! W-what are you doing?
"
7,8,Kyle,"I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
"
7,8,Craig,"HA! Told you you guys were straight!
"
7,8,Stan,"We're not straight! You're straight!
"
7,8,"Jason, Craig, Tweek, Token","You're straight!
"
7,8,Cartman,"You're straight like a freeway!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell is going on??
"
7,8,Cartman,"You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
"
7,8,Craig,"I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite. 
"
7,8,Cartman,"...So? I'm half bisexual!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!
"
7,8,Cartman,"I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"WHAT??
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"It was the craziest thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore. 
"
7,8,Mr. Slave,"Oh, Jesus Christ.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Look at that, Mr. Slave.  Our cup runneth over.
"
7,8,Mr. Slave,"Jesus Christ.
"
7,8,Jimbo,"Mr. Garrison, those are great pants.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too.  Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave?
"
7,8,Jimbo,"Uh, for what?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, you know...
"
7,8,Jimbo,"No.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Huh.
"
7,8,Randy,"Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh hey Randy.
"
7,8,Randy,"You're looking ultra-fabulous.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well thanks. You too.  So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom?
"
7,8,Randy,"Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Not, not like that?
"
7,8,Richard,"How about some shirazz, guys? 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Uh-OH, thanks, Mr. Tweek.
"
7,8,Richard,"My pleasure, silly-buns.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, wuh, welluh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place.
"
7,8,Richard,"Why?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass.
"
7,8,Mr. Slave,"Woohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.
"
7,8,Richard,"Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!
"
7,8,Patrons,"Huh?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?!
"
7,8,Randy,"Well, we don't ""pound butt,"" Mr. Garrison, we're straight.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!
"
7,8,Jimbo,"Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!
"
7,8,Skeeter,"'Sokay, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now.
"
7,8,Patrons,"Yeah.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"One of you?!  We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!
"
7,8,Cartman,"Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
"
7,8,Stan,"Wow, is that from Origins?
"
7,8,Cartman,"Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
"
7,8,Kyle,"Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
"
7,8,Cartman,"Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.
"
7,8,Stan,"Well, what can we do about it?
"
7,8,Cartman,"We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
"
7,8,Stan,"What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
"
7,8,Cartman,"Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
"
7,8,Stan,"Yeah. Wait, what?
"
7,8,Cartman,"You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
"
7,8,Craig,"Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there. 
"
7,8,Token,"When was the last guy you had a manicure, straight man? 
"
7,8,Jason,"Yeah, let's see that hair.  Look, he's not even using any product! 
"
7,8,Stan,"Hey, what's goin' on?
"
7,8,Craig,"Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!
"
7,8,Cartman,"He's not our friend. 
"
7,8,Kyle,"Stan? 
"
7,8,Jason,"This playground is for metrosexuals, macho man!
"
7,8,Craig,"Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! 
"
7,8,Kyle,"No! Ah!
"
7,8,Sheila,"Kyle! What happened to you?!
"
7,8,Kyle,"I got beat up at school... for being different.
"
7,8,Sheila,"WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?
"
7,8,Kyle,"No! For not being a metrosexual.
"
7,8,Sheila,"Gerald! Gerald, get down here!
"
7,8,Gerald,"Here I come! 
"
7,8,Kyle,"Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?
"
7,8,Gerald,"Kyle! You look terrible! 
"
7,8,Sheila,"The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.
"
7,8,Gerald,"Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.
"
7,8,Kyle,"Gah! Just leave me alone! 
"
7,8,A voice,"There you go! Now you look fabulous.
"
7,8,Kyan,"You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders for your look.
"
7,8,Kyle,"GRRRRR!!
"
7,8,Thom,"Now let's get down to the tango class and learn some new steps. 
"
7,8,Kyle,"That does it! I know what I have to do! 
"
7,8,Chef,"Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Chef, can I talk to you?
"
7,8,Chef,"Sure. Come on in.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Thanks. Come, Slave.  Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!
"
7,8,Mr. Slave,"Oh Jesus! Jesus Christ!
"
7,8,Chef,"Well, what do you want me to do about it?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?
"
7,8,Chef,"Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.
"
7,8,Mr. Slave,"How did you do that?
"
7,8,Chef,"Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, ""I'm in the house"" instead of ""I'm here."" But then white people all started to say ""in the house"" so we switched it to ""in the hizzouse."" Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then ""in the hizzle"" which we had to change to ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" and now, because white people say ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" we have to say ""flippity floppity floop.""
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing.  Wait.  That's it! I know exactly what to do!  Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. 
"
7,8,Chef,"Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that! 
"
7,8,Kyle,"One ticket to New York, please.
"
7,8,Clerk,"You're going to New York alone?
"
7,8,Kyle,"I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
"
7,8,Clerk,"Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes.
"
7,8,Kyle,"Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle, what are you doing here?
"
7,8,Kyle,"I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"What?? That's what I'm doing!
"
7,8,Kyle,"Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!
"
7,8,Kyle,"I thought of it first!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"No you didn't! No you didn't!
"
7,8,Kyle,"Did so! Did so!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"I thought of it yesterday!
"
7,8,Kyle,"I thought of it two days ago!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"I thought of it before you were born!
"
7,8,Mr. Slave,"Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh.  You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together.
"
7,8,Kyle,"Cool.
"
7,8,Stan,"Wow, we look great!
"
7,8,Cartman,"Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
"
7,8,Randy,"Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! 
"
7,8,Richard,"Oh my God!
"
7,8,Man,"Let's go! Let's go!
"
7,8,Ryan,"You guys have got to see these shoes I bought!
"
7,8,Gerald,"Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!
"
7,8,Jimbo,"Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!
"
7,8,Sharon,"You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.
"
7,8,Linda,"I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.
"
7,8,Mrs. Tweek,"I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad.
"
7,8,Head of Programming,"Guys, you've done a terrific job. Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is our number one show! 
"
7,8,Carson,"What can I say? We're fabulous.
"
7,8,Head of Programming,"You guys are changing the world! And tomorrow, we're gonna have you make over the President of the United States!
"
7,8,Jai,"Oh my God, I think I'm gonna faint. 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Room service. 
"
7,8,Head of Programming,"What? We didn't order any room service.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up.
"
7,8,Head of Programming,"Carol?  Well, I'll have to check on this. Excuse me a minute, fellas. 
"
7,8,Kyle,"Clear!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, Mr. Slave! 
"
7,8,Mr. Slave,"Unh, Jesus  Christ.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well crap, that didn't work.
"
7,8,Stan,"You'd better shut up, Craig.
"
7,8,Craig,"Everyone knows it's true!
"
7,8,Stan,"It is not!
"
7,8,Craig,"Is so!
"
7,8,Tom,"Craig! Behave yourself!
"
7,8,Randy,"Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?
"
7,8,Stan,"Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
"
7,8,Randy,"What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.
"
7,8,Tom,"Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.
"
7,8,Randy,"Oh really?!
"
7,8,Tom,"I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman.
"
7,8,Some men,"Ooooo.
"
7,8,Randy,"Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.
"
7,8,Other men,"Oh no, errrr!
"
7,8,Sharon,"Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!
"
7,8,Tom,"You don't... like us being metrosexual?
"
7,8,The Women,"NO!
"
7,8,Randy,"Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!
"
7,8,The Males,"Yeah!!
"
7,8,Linda,"What?
"
7,8,Jimbo,"We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!
"
7,8,Sharon,"This is crazy!
"
7,8,Randy,"Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!
"
7,8,Tom,"You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!
"
7,8,Craig,"Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.
"
7,8,Cartman,"That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.
"
7,8,Ryan,"Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness!
"
7,8,Stuart,"We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!
"
7,8,Kenny,"(Woohoohoo!)
"
7,8,Randy,"Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!
"
7,8,The Males,"Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets!
"
7,8,Mrs. Tweek,"What the hell did that show do to them?
"
7,8,Officer,"You sure you don't want to press charges?
"
7,8,Kyan,"That's okay, officer. I think they learned murder is wrong.
"
7,8,Carson,"Especially in those pants.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!
"
7,8,Jai,"Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing on TV!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.
"
7,8,Kyan,"Sorry Charlie, no sale. 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Buh... but... this doesn't make sense!  How can gay men do this to their own people??  Unless... you're not gay at all... 
"
7,8,Thom,"You just had to push it, didn't you?!
"
7,8,Jai,"Just had to keep asking question!
"
7,8,Carson,"Now you know the truth!
"
7,8,Kyle,"They aren't gay? Then what are they?
"
7,8,Kyan,"For a thousand years our kind have lived beneath the earth's crust! Banished by man in the Kindling Wars.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh my God. 
"
7,8,Leader,"We are the Crab People!
"
7,8,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
7,8,Mr. Slave,"Jesus Christ!
"
7,8,The Queer Eye Guys,"Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!
"
7,8,Crab Leader,"See now where we have been forced to live for a thousand years! But soon we shall rule the land above, and mankind will be gone!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Gone?? 
"
7,8,Crab Man 2,"Crab people are too small and weak to take over man by force, and so we came up with our perfect plan! 
"
7,8,Carson replica,"If you can't beat man,  change man!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind! 
"
7,8,Crab Leader,"When all the world is metrosexual, the crab people shall finally reign supreme!! 
"
7,8,Crab People,"Crab People! Crab People!
"
7,8,Crab Solo,"Taste like crab, talk like people.
"
7,8,Crab People,"Crab People!
"
7,8,Kyle,"You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
"
7,8,Crab Man 2,"Very well. If we can't make you into metrosexuals, then we will make you into crab people! Take them!! 
"
7,8,Singers,"(Crab People):
All things just keep getting better
You... came into my life
(Crab People)
and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.
(Crab People)
It's true. You bring out the best in me.
(Crab People)
When you are around, when you are around,
(Crab People)
All things just keep getting better.

7,8,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the first Metrosexual Pride Parade is underway! 
"
7,8,The Boys,"We're here! 
We're not queer! 
But we're close! 
Get used to it!
We're here! 
We're not queer! 
But we're close! 
Get used to it!
"
7,8,Sharon,"That does it! I can't take it anymore!
"
7,8,The Boys,"We're here! 
We're not queer! 
But we're close! 
Get used to it!
"
7,8,Linda,"I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.
"
7,8,Sharon,"Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do! 
"
7,8,Jimbo,"Whoa, look out! 
"
7,8,Randy,"Oh my God, it's on fire! 
"
7,8,Skeeter,"Put it out! Put it out!
"
7,8,Randy,"I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
"
7,8,Skeeter,"The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!
"
7,8,Officer Barbrady,"Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!
"
7,8,Jimbo,"Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God!
"
7,8,Skeeter,"Eeeek!
"
7,8,Randy,"Put it out! Put it out! Fire!
"
7,8,Carson,"Mr. President, it is such an honor to make you over!
"
7,8,Kyan,"Now, we've got to do something with your hair.
"
7,8,Thom,"And your nails are filthy. Let's get those clean.
"
7,8,Head of Programming,"This is gay gold! 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Stop them! They're crab people!
"
7,8,Crab Man 3,"They cannot see or hear us, foolish man. Now stand by and watch as your pitiful race becomes helpless!!
"
7,8,Carson,"That is very good, Mr. President. Now, put on this silk jacket. 
"
7,8,Kyle,"No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"You bastards!
"
7,8,Kyan,"That looks great! Now, how about some moisturizer. 
"
7,8,Sharon,"There they are! Get 'em!
"
7,8,Kyan,"What? 
"
7,8,Linda,"You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!
"
7,8,Sarah,"It's payback time! 
"
7,8,Head of Programming,"Oh my God, what are they doing?!
"
7,8,Crab Man 3,"Oh noooo!! 
"
7,8,Head of Programming,"Wha? What have you done?
"
7,8,Sharon,"We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.
"
7,8,Linda,"That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.
"
7,8,Sarah,"We're sorry, but we knew that the only answer was tuh kill the Queer Eye guys.
"
7,8,Head of Programming,"Well you're going to jail for thi-!  Wait a minute.  What is that?
"
7,8,Crab Leader,"No! Our evil plans! Noooo... 
"
7,8,Head of Programming,"Oh my God. They were crab people.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Yes! They were tryingn to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!
"
7,8,Kyle,"Mom!
"
7,8,Sheila,"Kyle!
"
7,8,Head of Programming,"I should have known they were crab people. They tried this before with The Jefferson.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"So now, can you please change your network's programming?
"
7,8,Head of Programming,"Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over. Gentlemen, back to Studio 12! We're gonna bring back the Latin fad.
"
7,8,Randy,"Hey eses.
"
7,8,Stuart,"Hey hefe. You want some cerveza? 
"
7,8,Stan,"Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
"
7,8,Kyle,"What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
"
7,8,Stan,"Yeah. It's cool, holmes.
"
7,8,Kyle,"...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
"
7,8,Stan,"Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. 
"
7,8,Cartman,"Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! 
"
7,8,Kyle,"God-damnit!
"
7,9,Cartman,"God dammit! 
"
7,9,Randy,"Stan, are you okay?
"
7,9,Stan,"Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band. 
"
7,9,Randy,"Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
"
7,9,Kyle,"He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
"
7,9,Kenny,"(What? Is it?)
"
7,9,Stan,"Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. 
"
7,9,Kyle,"I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?
"
7,9,Stan,"See what?
"
7,9,Cartamn,"Our band should play Christian rock! 
"
7,9,Kyle,"Christian rock?!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!
"
7,9,Kyle,"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
"
7,9,Cartman,"It worked for Creed!
"
7,9,Stan,"I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
"
7,9,Cartman,"You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
"
7,9,Kyle,"Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
"
7,9,Kyle,"You're on, fat boy!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! 
"
7,9,Kyle,"What a stupid asshole!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! 
"
7,9,Butters,"Oh, hi Eric.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! 
"
7,9,Butters,"...Ohhh!
"
7,9,Cartman,"No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! 
"
7,9,Token,"What?! We don't have a bass guitar.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! 
"
7,9,Butters,"Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. 
"
7,9,Token,"Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.
"
7,9,Cartman,"I told you, Token.
"
7,9,Token,"So, what are we doing?
"
7,9,Cartman,"Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
"
7,9,Butters,"Wow!
"
7,9,Cartman,"We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
"
7,9,Butters,"Awww.
"
7,9,Token,"I'm out. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- 
"
7,9,Butters,"Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?
"
7,9,Gerald,"Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
"
7,9,Kyle,"Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
"
7,9,Gerald,"Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
"
7,9,Gerald,"It wasn't your life yesterday. 
"
7,9,Kyle,"Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.
"
7,9,Gerald,"The answer is no, Kyle.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!
"
7,9,Sheila,"Kyle, don't belittle your own people!
"
7,9,Kyle,"Aaaargh! 
"
7,9,Stan,"Hey dude.
"
7,9,Kyle,"It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
"
7,9,Stan,"No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
"
7,9,Kyle,"Really?
"
7,9,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
7,9,Stan,"You got a computer?
"
7,9,Stan,"See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
"
7,9,Kyle,"All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. 
"
7,9,Kenny,"(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)
"
7,9,Stan,"Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! 
"
7,9,Stan,"What the hell is that?
"
7,9,Kyle,"I don't know.  Let me go check. 
"
7,9,Agent 1,"Freeze!! FBI!! 
"
7,9,Agent 2,"Down on the ground! Down on the ground! 
"
7,9,Agent 3,"Hurry up! Let me see those hands! 
"
7,9,Agent 2,"Tango Teamus to Point Bravo! Suspects in custody! 
"
7,9,Agent 4,"Move move move move move move! All clear, men!  Get your ass going!
"
7,9,Agent 5,"Move move move move move move! Move!
"
7,9,Gerald,"Kyle, what did you do?!
"
7,9,Kyle,"I don't know!
"
7,9,Cartman,"All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.
"
7,9,Token,"I don't know how to play bass. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.
"
7,9,Token,"I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! 
"
7,9,Token,"God-damnit! 
"
7,9,Cartman,"All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.
"
7,9,Butters,"Well done!
"
7,9,Kyle,"Um, sir-
"
7,9,Detective,"Shiut up!!  You downloaded a lot of songs! Says here you even downlaoded Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys are lookin' at. You got anything to say for yourselves?
"
7,9,Kyle,"We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
"
7,9,Detective,"Not a big deal! You think downloading music for free is not a big deal?! Put your couts on! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it!
"
7,9,Detective,"This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica.  Look. There's Lars now, sitting by his pool. 
"
7,9,Kyle,"What's the matter with him?
"
7,9,Detective,"This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it.  Come. There's more.  Here's Britney Spears' private jet. Notice anything?  Britney used to have a Gulfstream IV. Now she's had to sell it and get a Gulfstream III because people like you chose to download her music for free.  The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system. Still think downloading music for free is no big deal?
"
7,9,Kyle,"We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
"
7,9,Detective,"That is the folly of man. Now look in this window.  Here you see the loving family of Master P.  Next week is his son's birthday and, all he's ever wanted was an island in French Polynesia. 
"
7,9,Kyle,"So, he's gonna get it, right?
"
7,9,Detective,"I see an island without an owner. If things keep going the way they are, the child will not get his tropical paradise.
"
7,9,Stan,"We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!
"
7,9,Detective,"Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Almost there, you guys.
"
7,9,Butters,"Ow...
"
7,9,Token,"Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?
"
7,9,Cartman,"Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.
"
7,9,Butters,"Wow, neato! An album cover! 
"
7,9,Token,"This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!
"
7,9,Cartman,"I'm going to kill you one day, Token.
"
7,9,Token,"What did you say?! 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. 
"
7,9,Butters,"Cheese!
"
7,9,Cartman,"No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! 
"
7,9,Butters,"Cheese!
"
7,9,Cartman,"No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
"
7,9,Butters,"Oh...
"
7,9,Cartman,"Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!
"
7,9,Token,"Why the hell would I be looking way over there??
"
7,9,Cartman,"So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover. 
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.
"
7,9,Gerald,"Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.
"
7,9,Detective,"It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson.
"
7,9,Stan,"Boy, I'll say!
"
7,9,Detective,"If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees.
"
7,9,Randy,"Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
"
7,9,Detective,"Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it! 
"
7,9,Stan,"Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.
"
7,9,Kenny,"(Yeah)
"
7,9,Kyle,"No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!
"
7,9,Stan,"Oh yeah.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
"
7,9,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
7,9,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play. The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Oh hey guys. How's it going?
"
7,9,Kyle,"We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
"
7,9,Cartman,"I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.
"
7,9,Stan,"It is?? 
"
7,9,Cartman,"That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!
"
7,9,Kyle,"You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
"
7,9,Cartman,"It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
"
7,9,Kyle,"You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
"
7,9,Stan,"Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
"
7,9,Cartman,"I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! 
"
7,9,Kyle,"Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
"
7,9,Stan,"What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
"
7,9,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
7,9,T-Shirt Vendor,"Psalm T-Shirts! Get a T-Shirt with your favorite psalm!
"
7,9,Bible Vendor,"Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
"
7,9,Elderly Woman,"Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren. They need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics.
"
7,9,Cartman,"I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
"
7,9,Butters,"Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
"
7,9,MC,"All right, everyone! Welcome to Christfest 2003!  are you ready for some live music? 
"
7,9,A Man,"Yeah Jesus!
"
7,9,MC,"Then let's give it up now for one of Christian rock's biggest bands! Trinity! 
"
7,9,Trinity,"The Shepherd and the Light, and His Word lifted me up
And I praise His Holy Name wherever I go.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! 
"
7,9,Band Member 1,"Hey is this the way to the backstage?
"
7,9,Cartman,"Who are you?
"
7,9,Band Member 1,"We're the band Sanctified. We play metal and punk, but with lyrics that inspire faith in Christ.
"
7,9,Band Member 2,"Yeah. We proved that Christian music can be tough and hard core.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yeah, you guys are real hard core.
"
7,9,Band Member 1,"You bet your gosh-darned rear end we are!
"
7,9,Stage Hand,"All right, uhh, Sanctified, you guys are up next.
"
7,9,Band Member 3,"Yeah! Let's do it!
"
7,9,Band Member 2,"Sent down from Heaven! The Spirit and the Glory!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.
"
7,9,Band Member 2,"Well, that, that's cool.
"
7,9,Band Member 1,"Always good to be praying before you're playin'.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... 
"
7,9,Butters,"Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. 
"
7,9,MC,"All right, Christians, how are you feeling tonight? 
"
7,9,Fans,"Praise Jesus! Praise him! My Lord!
"
7,9,MC,"Let's keep this salvation train going with the hot band, Sanctified!
"
7,9,Stage Hand,"That's Faith + 1.
"
7,9,MC,"Uh. Uh apparently there's been a change. Give it up for ... Faith + 1! 
"
7,9,Cartman,"You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!
"
7,9,Stan,"Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!
"
7,9,Field Reporter,"Tom, we're now entering the second day of the rock band MOOP's refusal to play, and the second day of absolutely no other news to report on. In a recent poll we asked people if MOOP's refusal to play would stop them from downloading music off the Internet. One percent said yes. Two percent said no. And ninety-seven percent said, ""Who the hell is MOOP?!"" Back to you, Tom.
"
7,9,Lars Ulrich,"Hey, are you the guys protesting free Internet music downloading?
"
7,9,Stan,"Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!
"
7,9,Lars Ulrich,"That's right. Metallica is behind you dudes a thousand percent!
"
7,9,James Hetfield,"We're gonna sit here and protest with you until free downloadin' stop, hyeah!
"
7,9,Field Reporter,"Tom, it appears now the musicians' strike is growing! As I'm speaking, more musicians are arriving! It looks like Alanis Morissette, Blink 182, Britney Spears, and dozens of others are going to join MOOP in not playing music. This is a veritable Strikapalooza!
"
7,9,CEO,"Guys, we here at Faith Records were very moved by your performance at Christfest. You're one of the most talented Christian rock bands we've ever heard!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
"
7,9,Butters,"Heeheeheeyeah.
"
7,9,Executive 1,"We just have one question, though. We were looking over some of your lyrics, uh... ""I want to walk hand-in-hand with Jesus on a private beach for two./I want him to nibble on my ear and say 'I'm here for you.'"" Ih...it seems you really love Christ.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yes, we sure do.
"
7,9,Executive 1,"Eh no but ih it appears you are actually... in love with Christ. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??
"
7,9,Executive 1,"Well uh of course I do. I mean I just-
"
7,9,Cartman,"Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??
"
7,9,Executive 1,"Uh, we'd just like to make sure the bands we sign are in it for God, and not for the money.
"
7,9,Cartman,"I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.
"
7,9,Butters,"Uhm, oh. 
"
7,9,Executive 1,"That's- all we needed to know. Just, sign here and we'll get your album sold.
"
7,9,Announcer,"K-tal Records  presents the most inspirational Christian rock band in the world! Faith + 1,  featuring the very best in good, wholesome Christian music.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.
"
7,9,Announcer,"With great inspirational songs like ""I Wasn't Born Again Yesterday,""
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!
"
7,9,Announcer,"The CD is filled with instant classics. Who doesn't remember... 
"
7,9,Cartman,"The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!
You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...
Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...
"
7,9,Announcer,"This album is not available in stores and limited quantities are available, so order now!
"
7,9,Stan,"I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
"
7,9,Kyle,"You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!
"
7,9,Lars,"Yeah, if we all give in now, people might never stop downloading our music for free!
"
7,9,Kyle,"I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. 
"
7,9,Driver,"Certified letter for the rock band MOOP?
"
7,9,Kyle,"That's us!  ""Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies.""
"
7,9,Stan,"What??
"
7,9,Kyle,"""We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha.""  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.
"
7,9,Stan,"Is this for real?? This is for real!
"
7,9,Kyle,"He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
"
7,9,Lars,"But why play if we're not gonna make millions of dollars.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
"
7,9,Stan,"Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. 
"
7,9,Kyle,"From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! 
"
7,9,Britney,"...We're just about the money.
"
7,9,Other acts,"Yeah, yeah.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Oh.
"
7,9,Stan,"So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?
"
7,9,Kyle,"I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say ""Congratulations. You were right"" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
"
7,9,Token,"Cartman, what the hell is all this?
"
7,9,Cartman,"Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.
"
7,9,Token,"But you spent all the money we made!
"
7,9,Cartman,"We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!
"
7,9,Kyle,"Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? 
"
7,9,A Fan,"We like to praise Christ!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. 
"
7,9,Announcer,"Welcome to the presentation ceremony for Faith Plus One.  And now to present the award, here's Michael Collins. 
"
7,9,Kyle,"This is the worst day of my life.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. 
"
7,9,Michael Collins,"Boys, in recognition for over one million records sold, the Christian Recording Industry is please to present you with this Myrrh album. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?
"
7,9,Stan,"I thought albums win either gold or platinum.
"
7,9,Michael Collins,"Nono, in Christian rock, our albums go gold and frankincense and myrrh. Congratulations!
"
7,9,Kyle,"Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
"
7,9,Cartman,"You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!
"
7,9,Michael Collins,"No, but you can go double myrrh. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"GOD DAMMIT!! 
"
7,9,Michael Collins,"Oh, please don't take the Lord's Name in vain.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!
"
7,9,Michael Collins,"But you spread the Word of the Lord. You've brought faith in Jesus.
"
7,9,Cartman,"OH, FUCK JESUS!! 
"
7,9,Butters,"Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.
"
7,9,Token,"Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! 
"
7,9,A Man,"My ears are bleeding!
"
7,9,Token,"Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole! 
"
7,9,Stan,"Hm. Guess he got what he deserved. 
"
7,9,Butters,"Fuck you, Eric. 
"
7,10,Father Maxi,"Friends, we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver. 
"
7,10,Cartman,"Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.
"
7,10,Kyle,"You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!
"
7,10,Cartman,"Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
"
7,10,Father Maxi,"It is sometimes hard, in times like these, to understand God's way. Why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps, shouldn't be driving? It is then that we must understand, God's sense of humor is very different from our own. He does not laugh at the simple ""man walks into a bar"" joke. No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again. 
"
7,10,Mr. Garrison,"Look out!! 
"
7,10,Elderly Driver,"Huh? Was that a stop sign back there?  Ooooh, I think I hit a pothole.
"
7,10,Stan,"Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
"
7,10,Randy,"Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue.
"
7,10,Stan,"But they kill people.
"
7,10,Randy,"Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.
"
7,10,Marvin,"I'll be Goddamned if they think they can take my license away! 
"
7,10,Sharon,"Oooh, hi Dad.
"
7,10,Marvin,"I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill!
"
7,10,Randy,"Yes Dad.
"
7,10,Marvin,"And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!
"
7,10,Randy,"Yes I know.
"
7,10,Marvin,"And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive!
"
7,10,Stan,"I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.
"
7,10,Elderly Man,"Damnit Mona, this isn't the fastest way to Country Kitchen Buffet!
"
7,10,Mona,"No, but it's the shortest. I save the most gas that way. 
"
7,10,Elderly Man,"You save the most gas if you take the highway to Country Kitchen Buffet!
"
7,10,Mona,"Less miles means less gas, you old fool. 
"
7,10,Elderly Man,"There's Country Kitchen right there!
"
7,10,Mona,"Where?
"
7,10,Elderly Man,"Right there! You're gonna miss it! 
"
7,10,Mona,"Is this the parking lot?
"
7,10,Elderly Man,"I think so.
"
7,10,Anchor,"Another death tonight by a senior citizen motorist. Carl Zorn of Pine Junction was killed instantly when struck by a vehicle driven by Pete and Lydia Malman, who were trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. This latest tragedy comes only two days after the accident in Deer Creek, where three construction workers and a bulldozer  were run down by senior citizen Paul Thom , who was trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. Public outcry is forcing the DMV to consider suspending the licenses of all seniors over seventy, though no decision has yet to be made.
"
7,10,Marvin,"Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell!
"
7,10,Seniors,"Yeah!
"
7,10,Elderly Woman 1,"I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question!
"
7,10,Elderly Man 1,"We need to let everyone know we're pissed off, and we're not gonna take it anymore!
"
7,10,Seniors,"Yeah! Yeah! That's right, Pete!
"
7,10,Marvin,"That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about?  Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re-
"
7,10,Elderly Woman 2,"Oooo. Was it the kids skateboarding on the sidewalks? No? 
"
7,10,Elderly Man 2,"Oh, I remember! They're gonna take our licenses away!
"
7,10,Seniors,"Yeah! Yeah! That's right!
"
7,10,Marvin,"That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell!
"
7,10,Seniors,"Me too! Yeah, that's right! And mine too!
"
7,10,Elderly Woman 1,"I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question!
"
7,10,Marvin,"So now, what are we gonna do about it?
"
7,10,Elderly Man 3,"Do about what?
"
7,10,Elderly Woman 3,"They're gonna take our licenses away.
"
7,10,Elderly Woman 1,"They are?? They can't do that! 
"
7,10,Marvin,"That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite!
"
7,10,Elderly Man 3,"Great idea, Marvin!
"
7,10,Elderly Woman 4,"Wait, ah I think we're having that meeting right now.
"
7,10,Marvin,"...Oh, right, this is the meeting.
"
7,10,Elderly Man 4,"Right. To get those damn kids to stop skateboarding on the sidewalks!
"
7,10,Seniors,"Yeah! Yeah! That's right! Someone's gotta stop them!
"
7,10,Randy,"Sharon, have you seen Dad?
"
7,10,Sharon,"He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center.
"
7,10,Randy,"Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...
"
7,10,Sharon,"Every senior in town will be driving home...
"
7,10,Randy,"At the same time.  Oh My God!
"
7,10,Randy,"Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! 
"
7,10,Someone,"Oh my Goddd!
"
7,10,Marvin,"All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime.
"
7,10,Elderly Woman 1,"So long, everybody.
"
7,10,Elderly Man 5,"Goodbye, Missy. 
"
7,10,Randy,"Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?!
"
7,10,Gerald,"We've gotta get out of here!
"
7,10,Randy,"The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!
"
7,10,Gerald,"They, they're... they're playing street hockey!
"
7,10,Randy,"Oh My God!! 
"
7,10,Cartman,"With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!
"
7,10,Kyle,"It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
"
7,10,Cartman,"I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
"
7,10,Randy,"GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! 
"
7,10,Kyle,"Dude, look!
"
7,10,Randy,"GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!
"
7,10,Stan,"What is that?
"
7,10,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
7,10,Randy,"GET OFF... GET STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET!
"
7,10,Kyle,"Dude, is that your dad?
"
7,10,Stan,"I think so.
"
7,10,Cartman,"Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
"
7,10,Stan,"What is he saying?
"
7,10,Kyle,"I can't understand him.
"
7,10,Randy,"GAAAAAH!!
"
7,10,Cartman,"Calm down! We cannot understand you!
"
7,10,Kenny,"(Ohhhhh, look!)  (You guys!)
"
7,10,Stan,"Oh Jesus!
"
7,10,Cartman,"Old people!
"
7,10,Randy,"Come on! 
"
7,10,Cartman,"Oh God, they're coming! 
"
7,10,Randy,"Get over there! Stay low! 
"
7,10,Kyle,"Why are they all out driving at the same time?
"
7,10,Randy,"Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find-  AWWWW!!
"
7,10,Elderly Driver,"I don't remember there being a building here.
"
7,10,Randy,"RUN! 
"
7,10,Elderly Passenger,"I told you to turn left, Larry.
"
7,10,Randy,"Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! 
"
7,10,Kyle,"Aah! There's another one!
"
7,10,Randy and the Boys,"AAAHH!!
"
7,10,Elderly Driver,"Excuse me, is this Costello Avenue? 
"
7,10,Randy,"In here! 
"
7,10,Cartman,"They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
"
7,10,Randy,"Quiet! Keep quiet! 
"
7,10,Stan,"Dad, I'm scared.
"
7,10,Randy,"Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. 
"
7,10,Stan,"I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
"
7,10,Randy,"Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. 
"
7,10,Elderly Driver,"How the hell did we get up here?
"
7,10,Randy and the Boys,"AAAAAAAHH!! 
"
7,10,Elderly Passenger,"I told you this was the wrong way!
"
7,10,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside of the Department of Motor Vehicles, where senior citizens have until three p.m. to hand over their driver's licenses. The new law was passed just three days after the Night of Horror, in which all seniors were out driving at the same time, causing fourteen deaths and three million dollars in damage.
"
7,10,DMV Official,"Alrighty.   There we go. Next? 
"
7,10,Elderly Man 2,"It ain't right what you're doin'! I never had an accident in my life!
"
7,10,Elderly Woman 6,"That's right. You shouldn't punish all of us. 
"
7,10,DMV Official,"We're sorry, but this is the only way to be sure. Next please.  There we go.
"
7,10,Elderly Man 6,"But how am I supposed to get to the grocery store? Or the pharmacy to buy medicine?
"
7,10,DMV Official,"Well, maybe you should be in a nursing home. Hmmm?
"
7,10,Elderly Man 7,"Some of us would rather die!
"
7,10,DMV Official,"Well, we can certainly help you with that, too.
"
7,10,Elderly Woman 7,"We aren't second-class citizens!
"
7,10,Elderly Man 8,"That's right! You can take our licenses, but you'll never take our pride!
"
7,10,An Elderly Man,"Yeah...
"
7,10,Cartman,"Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
"
7,10,Marvin,"Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around.
"
7,10,Stan,"Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.
"
7,10,Marvin,"God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!
"
7,10,Kyle,"Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
"
7,10,Cartman,"My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.
"
7,10,Marvin,"Okay, all set? 
"
7,10,Kenny,"(Oooooo my God!) 
"
7,10,Stan,"Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.
"
7,10,Marvin,"Eh?  Go around. Go around, you moron!
"
7,10,Barbrady,"Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!
"
7,10,Cartman,"I believe that's us... thank God. 
"
7,10,Barbrady,"Could I see your license, please?
"
7,10,Marvin,"I ain't got one! You peckers took it!
"
7,10,Barbrady,"Well then, I have to take you to jail.
"
7,10,Marvin,"You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try!
"
7,10,Marvin,"Stupid son of a- God damnit!
"
7,10,Barbrady,"I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.
"
7,10,Randy,"Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!
"
7,10,Marvin,"Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!
"
7,10,Randy,"You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!
"
7,10,Marvin,"Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.
"
7,10,Randy,"We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?
"
7,10,Marvin,"Kiss my sagging ass!
"
7,10,Randy,"Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!
"
7,10,Marvin,"Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP!
"
7,10,Stan,"What's that?
"
7,10,Marvin,"The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' discriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right!  And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!
"
7,10,Mr. Garrison,"And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a ""Mongol,"" not to be confused with a ""mongoloid"" like the actor, Nicholas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what  ...year ...the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...  That's odd.  Those ROTC guys are way off course. 
"
7,10,Cartman,"More old people!
"
7,10,Stan,"The American Association of Retired Persons.
"
7,10,Mr. Garrison,"Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back.
"
7,10,AARP leader,"Set up a perimeter! Bring Bravo Team to Point Delta!
"
7,10,AARP member 1,"Bravo Team is go.
"
7,10,AARP member 2,"Move! Move! Move!
"
7,10,AARP member 3,"Let's go! Let's go! 
"
7,10,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, can I help you folks find something?  Oowww! 
"
7,10,Cartman,"Old people gone mad!
"
7,10,AARP member,"Contact.  Put your hands up, young man!
"
7,10,AARP leader,"Marvin Marsh?
"
7,10,Marvin,"Yes?
"
7,10,AARP leader,"I'm Bill Stewart, President of the AARP. Hu-we've come to help the seniors in this town fight back.
"
7,10,Marvin,"Oh, it's nice to meet ya, Bill.
"
7,10,Stewart,"Huh?? We came as fast as we could. We just had to stop by Country Kitchen Buffet first.
"
7,10,AARP leader,"It's the nursing home! Liberate our comrades! 
"
7,10,Male Nurse,"There now, Mr. Johnson.  We can go to the cafeteria and get you some creamed corn and toast.  Can I help you?
"
7,10,AARP leader,"Help this!  The revolution is on, brother!  We're taking control of the town!
"
7,10,Mr. Johnson,"Well, alright, well it's about damn time!  Hey everyone, we're taking the town. 
"
7,10,AARP member,"Seniors, we're taking the town over.
"
7,10,AARP leader,"The revolution is on! 
"
7,10,Elderly Woman,"The revolution?
"
7,10,Elderly Man,"Oh, I'd better get my other sweater. 
"
7,10,A Nurse,"Mrs. Wyland, seniors are taking over the town. Would you like a gun?
"
7,10,Mrs. Wyland,"Oh, I suppose so.
"
7,10,Randy,"What the hell is going on?!
"
7,10,AARP member,"Shut your piehole and get over there! 
"
7,10,Gerald,"Randy, what is this?
"
7,10,Stewart,"Hey! You are now under the authority of the AARP!
"
7,10,Marvin,"Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!
"
7,10,Randy,"Dad, what are you doing??
"
7,10,Marvin,"The AARP is gonna help us take this town until we get our licenses back!
"
7,10,Elderly Woman,"Yeah, and we're gonna ask for more money in Medi-Care, too!
"
7,10,AARP leader,"That's right.
"
7,10,Elderly Man,"Yeah.
"
7,10,Man in Vest,"Have you all got Alzheimer's? The-they're not gonna listen to a bunch of whacked out senior citizens.
"
7,10,Stewart,"Heh??  We'll tell them if they don't give us our demands, we'll start killin' hostages!
"
7,10,Man in Vest,"Huh, right. They're gonna really believe that. 
"
7,10,Marvin,"Isn't that a little extreme, Bill?
"
7,10,Stewart,"Heh??  No, we gotta be tough! Just like with those damned Japs!
"
7,10,Randy,"This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!
"
7,10,Marvin,"The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now!
"
7,10,Marvin,"All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station.
"
7,10,AARP member,"Reinforcements have arrived from the nursing home in Conifer.
"
7,10,Stewart,"Good! Hell, us senior citizens could take over the entire country!
"
7,10,AARP lookout,"We've got company! 
"
7,10,Tank Driver,"Attention seniors: lay down your weapons and turns yourselves over!
"
7,10,Stewart,"Mrs. Applegate, show 'em we mean business.
"
7,10,Mrs. Applegate,"All right. 
"
7,10,Tank Driver,"What do you want?
"
7,10,Stewart,"Heh??
"
7,10,Marvin,"We want our licenses back!
"
7,10,Other Seniors,"Yeah!
"
7,10,Elderly Woman,"That's right. And we want more money in Medi-Care!
"
7,10,Other Seniors,"Yeah!
"
7,10,Elderly Man,"And we want those damned kids to stop skateboardin' on the sidewalk!
"
7,10,Other Seniors,"Yeah!
"
7,10,Stan,"Hey Dad.
"
7,10,Randy,"Stan! Boys! You're safe!
"
7,10,Stan,"Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
"
7,10,Randy,"They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!
"
7,10,Kyle,"They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
"
7,10,Randy,"Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!
"
7,10,Stan,"No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
"
7,10,Randy,"No, son. We... like to sleep in.
"
7,10,An Elderly Woman,"Two hostages come front and center! 
"
7,10,Randy,"They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!
"
7,10,Stan,"All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
"
7,10,Cartman,"So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
"
7,10,Kyle,"We can't fight them, Cartman.
"
7,10,Cartman,"No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.
"
7,10,Kyle,"Country Kitchen Buffet?
"
7,10,Cartman,"Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
"
7,10,Kyle,"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
"
7,10,Cartman,"Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.
"
7,10,Stan,"Yeah, I remember hearing about that.
"
7,10,Kyle,"Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
"
7,10,Cartman,"I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. 
"
7,10,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
7,10,Stan,"All right!
"
7,10,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
7,10,Cartman,"Aw yeah!
"
7,10,Stan,"We did it! 
"
7,10,Stan,"...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
"
7,10,Cartman,"Well, right, or we could always do that.
"
7,10,Stewart,"All right everyone, round up your ammunition and get ready to move! We're takin' this war further out!
"
7,10,AARP Members,"All right!
"
7,10,Marvin,"Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back.
"
7,10,Stewart,"Huh??  Heck no! This is goin' too well.We're gonna take the whole country back. Wipe out everyone below the age of sixty five!
"
7,10,Marvin,"Wipe 'em out?? What are you? Senile?
"
7,10,Stewart,"Come on, everyone! It's time to plan for Phase 2!  What the heck?  Huh? What is this?! It's 6 a.m. C-Country Kitchen should be open!
"
7,10,Elderly Man 9,"It's not open? It has to be! 
"
7,10,Elderly Man 10,"Try a window.
"
7,10,Elderly Man 11,"They're blocked from the inside.
"
7,10,Stewart,"No...  Let us in! Let us in!
"
7,10,Elderly Man 9,"Open the door! It's six a.m. 
"
7,10,Elderly Woman,"Open the Country Kitchen Buffet for us!
"
7,10,Elderly Man,"You have to let us in! 
"
7,10,Army Official,"All right everyone, area secure. Collect their weapons and free the hostages.  That was a great strategy, boys. You may very well have saved this entire country. 
"
7,10,Randy,"Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?
"
7,10,Army Official,"Everything is fine. Control of the town is back to you folks.
"
7,10,Stewart,"Country Kitchen... wha-what happened?
"
7,10,Soldier,"Sir, what should we do with this one?
"
7,10,Army Official,"It's up to the townspeople.
"
7,10,Randy,"Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.
"
7,10,Stan,"Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
"
7,10,Randy,"Huh?
"
7,10,Stan,"Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
"
7,10,Marvin,"That's right.
"
7,10,Stan,"And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
"
7,10,Marvin,"I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families.
"
7,10,Randy,"Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home.
"
7,10,Marvin,"Sure. I'll drive.
"
7,10,Randy,"That's our Grandpa. 
"
7,10,Stan,"Dude, I hate my family. 
"
7,11,Stan,"Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
"
7,11,Stan,"Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
"
7,11,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
7,11,Cartman,"Who's joking? 
"
7,11,Kyle,"You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
"
7,11,Cartman,"You have AIDS?
"
7,11,Kyle,"No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Wow! Casa Bonita?!
"
7,11,Kenny,"(Woo-hoo!)
"
7,11,Stan,"What's Casa Bonita?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!
"
7,11,Kyle,"It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
"
7,11,Cartman,"This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!
"
7,11,Kyle,"Who said I'm inviting you? 
"
7,11,Cartman,"You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
"
7,11,Kyle,"I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
"
7,11,Kyle,"Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
"
7,11,Cartman,"I have never been a dick to you.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
"
7,11,Kyle,"Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! ""I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm."" ""Fuck off, Cartman!""
"
7,11,Cartman,"Okay, except maybe for that one time.
"
7,11,Kyle,"You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! 
"
7,11,Kyle,"Sorry, my mind's made up.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
"
7,11,Kyle,"I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! 
"
7,11,Kyle,"I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
"
7,11,Cartman,"No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Hi Kyle. 
"
7,11,Kyle,"That isn't it, Cartman.
"
7,11,Cartman,"What isn't it?
"
7,11,Kyle,"That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
"
7,11,Cartman,"...I don't understand the difference.
"
7,11,Kyle,"I know you don't. 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.
"
7,11,Jimmy,"Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how ""do"" you act nice to people?
"
7,11,Jimmy,"Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?
"
7,11,Jimmy,"Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Like what?
"
7,11,Jimmy,"Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Who's there?
"
7,11,Jimmy,"Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Now you say, ""Ingmar Bergman who?"" 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!
"
7,11,Kyle,"Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! 
"
7,11,Butters,"Wow, that's gonna be so fun!
"
7,11,Stan,"Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
"
7,11,Kenny,"(Yeah!) 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Hey Kyle.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Well?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Well what?
"
7,11,Kyle,"How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
"
7,11,Cartman,"I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.
"
7,11,Cartman,"So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
"
7,11,Kyle,"I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"
7,11,Cartman,"I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. 
"
7,11,Kyle,"Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?
"
7,11,Cartman,"I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
"
7,11,Kyle,"That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Good.
"
7,11,Kyle,"And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!
"
7,11,Butters,"What's this all about, Eric?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Butters, can you keep a secret?
"
7,11,Butters,"Well, sure I can!
"
7,11,Cartman,"For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
"
7,11,Butters,"Nnn-how terrible?
"
7,11,Cartman,"A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
"
7,11,Butters,"What?? 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?
"
7,11,Butters,"I just see stars. 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
"
7,11,Butters,"Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? 
"
7,11,Butters,"It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
"
7,11,Butters,"When do you think uh it'll get here?
"
7,11,Cartman,"I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
"
7,11,Butters,"What??
"
7,11,Cartman,"According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!
"
7,11,Cartman,"No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
"
7,11,Butters,"Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??
"
7,11,Cartman,"Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! 
"
7,11,Butters,"AAAAHH! 
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh Jeez!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! 
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh God! Oh Jesus! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
"
7,11,Butters,"But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
"
7,11,Cartman,"No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
"
7,11,Butters,"Are you sure?
"
7,11,Cartman,"I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
"
7,11,Butters,"But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. 
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh God, oh God!
"
7,11,Kyle,"Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
"
7,11,Sheila,"Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Oh. Thanks, dude.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Hope you have a good one. See you later. 
"
7,11,Kyle,"Oh wait. Cartman.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Yes?
"
7,11,Kyle,"Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
"
7,11,Kyle,"I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
"
7,11,Kyle,"All right, let's go.
"
7,11,Sheila,"Okay, boys. Get in the car.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!
"
7,11,Sheila,"Oh, hello Chris, Linda.
"
7,11,Chris,"Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?
"
7,11,Kyle,"Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
"
7,11,Chris,"We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything. 
"
7,11,Linda,"Oh Butters!
"
7,11,Kyle,"Aw dude, weak.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?
"
7,11,Kyle,"Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
"
7,11,Stan,"Yeah, it's kinda weird.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
"
7,11,Kyle,"Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
"
7,11,Stan,"Yeah.
"
7,11,Sheila,"That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
"
7,11,Stan,"Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 
"
7,11,Kyle,"Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 
"
7,11,Sheila,"I'll drive you boys. 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!
"
7,11,Captain,"All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him.
"
7,11,Butters,"""Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square...""  Hello?  Hello??
"
7,11,Cartman,"Butters!
"
7,11,Butters,"Hwaaaah!!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
"
7,11,Butters,"Wuh, wait, well, what happened??
"
7,11,Cartman,"The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
"
7,11,Butters,"What about my parents. Did you see them?
"
7,11,Cartman,"There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. 
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh my God, let me see!
"
7,11,Cartman,"No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
"
7,11,Butters,"How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
"
7,11,Cartman,"We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. 
"
7,11,Butters,"Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
"
7,11,Field Reporter,"Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling.
"
7,11,Captain,"All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. 
"
7,11,Captain,"Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters. 
"
7,11,Cartman,"What what what?
"
7,11,Captain,"I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"UUuuugh!! 
"
7,11,Butters,"But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
"
7,11,Butters,"Who's coming this way?
"
7,11,Cartman,"The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh God! I hate cannibals!
"
7,11,Cartman,"They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
"
7,11,Butters,"Noooo!
"
7,11,Cartman,"We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
"
7,11,Butters,"But I can't see nothin'.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.
"
7,11,Butters,"Are we out in the destruction?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
"
7,11,Butters,"Aw man.
"
7,11,Cartman,"All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
"
7,11,Butters,"Huh... Oh, it's terrible.
"
7,11,Cartman,"We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
"
7,11,Butters,"Whoa!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!
"
7,11,Butters,"Whaaat??
"
7,11,Cartman,"It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! 
"
7,11,Butters,"AAAAHH!
"
7,11,Cartman,"We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
"
7,11,Butters,"Waaaaaah!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? 
"
7,11,Butters,"Ooohhhh!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die! 
"
7,11,Butters,"Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!
"
7,11,Cartman,"The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh no!
"
7,11,Cartman,"We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
"
7,11,Butters,"Uh w-where??
"
7,11,Cartman,"Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
"
7,11,Butters,"Aren't you coming?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
"
7,11,Butters,"Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
"
7,11,Cartman,"I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!
"
7,11,Butters,"Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
"
7,11,Cartman,"We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
"

"
7,11,Butters,"Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
"
7,11,Worker,"Kid, what are you doin' here?
"
7,11,Butters,"I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.
"
7,11,Worker,"Kid, I don't know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump.
"
7,11,Butters,"Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
"
7,11,Worker,"No, I mean you're at the garbage dump. The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they've been looking for you for over a week.
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?
"
7,11,Cartman,"We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!
"
7,11,Sheila,"Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.  Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone.  Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great!  Boys, they found Butters.  He's okay.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Oh, awesome.
"
7,11,Stan,"I knew he'd turn up.
"
7,11,Sheila,"Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Oh really? 
"
7,11,Kyle,"What?
"
7,11,Sheila,"Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.  Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita. 
"
7,11,Kyle,"What?
"
7,11,Sheila,"Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
"
7,11,Cartman,"But... Casa Bonita.

7,12,Butters,"Let him have it, Stan!
"
7,12,Stan,"Shut up, Butters!

"
7,12,Stan,"What's that?
"
7,12,Gary,"That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that?
"
7,12,Stan,"No.
"
7,12,Dad,"Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan!

"
7,12,Mark,"All right!
"
7,12,Kids,"Yeah!
"
7,12,Mark,"Woohoo! OOWW!
"
7,12,Stan,"The... Book of Mormon? What's that?
"
7,12,Gary,"You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.
"
7,12,Stan,"Who's Joseph Smith? 
"
7,12,Mark,"Only the most important person in the world.
"
7,12,Jenny,"You've never heard of him?
"
7,12,Stan,"No!
"
7,12,Gary,"Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad.
"
7,12,The other kids,"Oh yes, tell us Dad. Yeah Dad. All right.
"
7,12,Dad,"All right, you rascals. Gather round.  Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s.
"
7,12,Singers,"Joseph Smith was called a prophet
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
He started the Mormon religion
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
7,12,Blacksmith,"There goes that kooky Joseph Smith
"
7,12,Customer,"You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus.
"
7,12,Woman,"Well, how do you know he didn't?
"
7,12,Singers,"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Joseph Smith was called a prophet-
"
7,12,Butler,"Hey, Joseph! I told my wife that you spoke with God and Jesus, and she didn't believe it.
"
7,12,Smith,"Well it's true. I did.
"
7,12,Wife,"Where?
"
7,12,Smith,"I was out in the woods, praying  I was asking God if I should be a Protestant, or a Catholic, or what? And suddenly God and Jesus appeared before me.  And they said I should start my own church, because none of the others had it right.  And that's exactly how it happened.
"
7,12,Butler,"You see? You believe it now?
"
7,12,Wife,"Well yeah, sure. Why would he make that up?
"
7,12,Singers,"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Many people believed Joseph
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
And that night he-ee saw an angel
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
7,12,Smith,"And please bless Mother and Father, and please keep our bellies full of yum-yums and luscious goodies.  AAAHH!  Oh my gosh!
"
7,12,Angel,"I am Moroni. I am a Native American.
"
7,12,Smith,"A...  Native American?  But your skin is white.
"
7,12,Moroni,"Yes. Long ago all Native American were white. We all came to America from Jerusalem. And while we were here we were visited by Christ.
"
7,12,Smith,"Jesus live here in America?
"
7,12,Moroni,"Yes. Eventually, my people were all killed by the other tribe of Israel, and as punishment, God turned their skin red. These are the Native Americans you know today. 
"
7,12,Singers,"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
7,12,Moroni,"There is an ancient book buried near here, written on gold plates that account my people's lives. Also buried with the book are two seer stones, the Urim and Thummim, which will allow you to translate the writings. Find it, and fulfill your destiny. 
"
7,12,Smith,"Wooww... 
"
7,12,Singers,"Joseph Smith was called a prophet
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
7,12,Dad,"And we all know what happened then, don't we?
"
7,12,Kids,"Yeah! I know!
"
7,12,Stan,"What happened then? 
"
7,12,Mom,"Ooo, the Rice Crispy squares are done!
"
7,12,Kids,"Rice Crispy squares! Yay! All right! Rice Crispy squares!
"
7,12,Dad,"Hey gang, let's wrap some more of them up in plastic wrap and hand them out to the poor!
"
7,12,Gary,"Awesome! I can't wait!
"
7,12,Jenny,"Yeah! 
"
7,12,Gary,"You coming, Stan?
"
7,12,Stan,"No, I was supposed to be home at eight.
"
7,12,Dad,"Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan. 
"
7,12,"Mark, Jenny","Bye Stan!
"
7,12,Mom,"Great to meet you!
"
7,12,Gary,"Bye!
"
7,12,Stan,"...Hello?
"
7,12,Sharon,"Oh, hi Stan.
"
7,12,Stan,"Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
"
7,12,Randy,"Who?
"
7,12,Shelly,"Shut up, turd! We're watching Friends!
"
7,12,Stan,"The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
"
7,12,Sharon,"Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.
"
7,12,Stan,"That's not what the Harrisons said.
"
7,12,Randy,"Who are the Harrisons?
"
7,12,Stan,"The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
"
7,12,Randy,"Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!
"
7,12,Stan,"They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
"
7,12,Randy,"We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.
"
7,12,Stan,"But that's just you and your friends.
"
7,12,Shelly,"I said shut up, turd!
"
7,12,Stan,"Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
"
7,12,Randy,"All right, that does it!
"
7,12,Sharon,"Where are you going?
"
7,12,Randy,"I'm gonna go have a talk with this ""Mr. Harrison.""  If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! 
"
7,12,Sharon,"Randy, don't cause trouble.
"
7,12,Randy,"Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?
"
7,12,Stan,"Yeah.
"
7,12,Randy,"Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass! 
"
7,12,Randy,"God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! 
"
7,12,Mr. Harrison,"Hello!
"
7,12,Randy,"Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?
"
7,12,Mr. Harrison,"I sure am.  The, the name's Gary.
"
7,12,Randy,"Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh is here!
"
7,12,Randy,"Uh, look, I just want to tell you that
"
7,12,Karen,"Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so nice to meet you!
"
7,12,Randy,"Well, thanks. Uh...
"
7,12,Gary Sr,"Karen just finished baking the most amazing Rice Crispy squares.
"
7,12,Karen,"With chocolate frosting
"
7,12,Gary Sr,"Come on out of the cold. You've gotta try one. Or six. 
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to have you over.
"
7,12,Karen,"I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing.
"
7,12,Randy,"Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.
"
7,12,"Gary Sr., Karen","Uh huh?
"
7,12,Randy,"You know. About... God, and stuff.
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him.
"
7,12,Randy,"Well, I-
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry.
"
7,12,Karen,"We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... Oh, we forget not everyuone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious!
"
7,12,Randy,"Well, no, no, I just-
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said ""Who the heck do these people think they are?!"" I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again.
"
7,12,Randy,"Y-you can call me... Randy.
"
7,12,Karen,"Randy, the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion. We know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us.
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"To each his own, right?
"
7,12,Randy,"Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Well, because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates, right where the angel Moroni said they would be.
"
7,12,Smith,"I found them! I found them!  You're not gonne believe it, everybody! I found them!
"
7,12,Butler,"Found what?
"
7,12,Smith,"Another New Testament of Jesus Christ!
"
7,12,People,"What? What did he say? Are you crazy?
"
7,12,Smith,"Last night, a Native America angel told me where I could find another testament of Jesus Christ, so I went out to the woods. I dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look. 
"
7,12,Smith,"Maybe there isn't anything out here.  Wait a tick!  What's this?  Wow...
"
7,12,Smith,"Inside the stone box, I found the magical seer stones. Under that, I found four gold plates written in strange writing .
"
7,12,Smith,"This must be the Gospel that Jesus told the Nephites!
"
7,12,Smith,"Well, they were the most amazing things I'd ever gazed upon.
"
7,12,Man,"Well, so where are they?
"
7,12,Smith,"Where are what?
"
7,12,Woman,"The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?
"
7,12,Smith,"Oh. Oh, well, I... was not allowed to take them. You see, after I found the plates, the angel Moroni appeared to me again and said that I am not allowed to show the plates, or the seer stones, to anybody. Because first I must translate what's written on the plates into English, so you can all read it!
"
7,12,Singers,"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
7,12,People,"Wow, amazing!
"
7,12,Singers,"He found the stones and golden plates
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Even though nobody else ever saw them
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
7,12,Stan,"So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?
"
7,12,Randy,"Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.
"
7,12,Stan,"See? That's what happened to me!
"
7,12,Randy,"Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?
"
7,12,Sharon,"What are you talking about?
"
7,12,Randy,"Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.
"
7,12,Stan,"That's what they made me think, too!
"
7,12,Randy,"All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!
"
7,12,Cartman,"Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?
"
7,12,Stan,"Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
"
7,12,Cartman,"Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.
"
7,12,Kyle,"Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
"
7,12,Stan,"What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.
"
7,12,Gary,"Hey Stan.
"
7,12,Cartman,"Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.
"
7,12,Gary,"Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one.  I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front.
"
7,12,Stan,"Wow, you made this?
"
7,12,Cartman,"Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
"
7,12,Gary,"Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along? 
"
7,12,Stan,"Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... 
"
7,12,Gary,"Oh here comes my family now!
"
7,12,The Harrisons,"Hey you guys! 
"
7,12,Karen,"Look, we painted our faces! 
"
7,12,Mark,"I'm a lion. 
"
7,12,Jenny,"I'm an alien. 
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be? 
"
7,12,Cartman,"Oh my God...
"
7,12,Dave,"You gonna come with us to the fire station, Stan?
"
7,12,Stan,"Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out with your friend Stan?
"
7,12,Gary,"Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!
"
7,12,Mark,"We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh.
"
7,12,Karen,"Aw, we'll all see each other tonight when we go to Stan's house for dinner. Stay and play with your friend, Gary.
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Yeah. Have a good time, boys. 
"
7,12,Mark,"Let's go.  Our faces are painted. 
"
7,12,Kyle,"Wow!
"
7,12,Gary,"So what do you guys wanna do?
"
7,12,Cartman,"Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. 
"
7,12,Gary,"Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.
"
7,12,Cartman,"Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. 
"
7,12,Gary,"So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great!
"
7,12,Stan,"Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.
"
7,12,Gary,"Sure.
"
7,12,Stan,"What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
"
7,12,Gary,"Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.
"
7,12,Stan,"Yeah, but... how?
"
7,12,Singers,"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
7,12,Man,"What's this all about, Mr. Smith?
"
7,12,Smith,"Mr. Harris, can you keep a secret?
"
7,12,Harris,"Well, sure I can.
"
7,12,Smith,"I have, in my possession, an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of Jesus Christ's second coming. Here, in America.
"
7,12,Harris,"In America?  Really? That sounds kind of...
"
7,12,Singers,"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
7,12,Smith,"It's true. And I'm going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read. Now, ahah-I know you have a lot of money, Mr. Harris, and I'm just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs.
"
7,12,Harris,"Mmm, I don't know. Uh, how do you expect to translate it?
"
7,12,Smith,"With these. 
"
7,12,Harris,"Rocks?
"
7,12,Smith,"They're not rocks. They're seer stones, given to me by an angel. With them, God allowed me to translate the plates into English. Watch. You take this quill and paper and write down what I say. Sit here.  I have the golden plates here in this hat. I need to have them somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual light.
"
7,12,Harris,"Really?
"
7,12,Smith,"Now, when I put the seer stones into the hat, the ancient letter light up and change into English, which I can then read to you.
"
7,12,Harris,"Wow! 
"
7,12,Smith,"Ooo, I'm seeing the light. Oh, okay. Write this down. ""And... so... it... was... that... Christ... appeared before... the... Nephites.""
"
7,12,Singers,"And that's how the Book of Mormon was written
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dahumb dahumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dumb dumb dumb duuumb, duuumb.
"
7,12,Randy,"One two three four. ""Pay one thousand dollars property tax.""  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.
"
7,12,Shelly,"I wanna watch TV.
"
7,12,Randy,"We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!
"
7,12,Stan,"Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
"
7,12,Randy,"And?  Your turn, Sharon.
"
7,12,Stan,"It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
"
7,12,Randy,"Yes.
"
7,12,Stan,"But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
"
7,12,Randy,"Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! 
"
7,12,Gary,"Hey everybody.
"
7,12,Mark,"Wow, what a great house!
"
7,12,Karen,"You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice to meet youuu!
"
7,12,Jenny,"And you must be Stan's sister. Oh, I think your brother's the greatest.
"
7,12,Shelly,"My brother is a stupid turd.
"
7,12,Gary,"Hey Stan.
"
7,12,Stan,"Hey Gary.
"
7,12,Randy,"Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.
"
7,12,Stan,"Dad!
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Ohohoho, really? Wel, that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the Joseph Smith story! The one that proves he was for real!
"
7,12,The Harrisons,"Yeah! Woohoo!
"
7,12,Randy,"Ooo, what's that?
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat?
"
7,12,Stan,"Yeah.
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home.
"
7,12,Singers,"Martin went home to his wife
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
And showed her pages from the Book of Mormon
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
7,12,Harris,"A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said. I wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book.
"
7,12,Mrs. Harris,"Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates?
"
7,12,Singers,"Lucy Harris smart smart smart
Smart smart smart smart smart
"
7,12,Harris,"Why would he make it up?
"
7,12,Singers,"Martin Harris dumb dadumb-
"
7,12,Lucy,"All right, here. I'm gonna hide these pages.  If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he'll be able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith is making it all up, then the new translations will be different from these.
"
7,12,Harris,"Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem. 
"
7,12,Singers,"Lucy Harris smart smart smart
Martin Harris dumb.
So Martin went on back to Smith
Said the pages had gone away
Smith got mad and told Martin
He needed to go pray
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
7,12,Harris,"Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.
"
7,12,Smith,"I would love to, Martin, except, I just had a vision. And the Lord said he's very angry with me for letting you take those pages.
"
7,12,Harris,"He is??
"
7,12,Singers,"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
7,12,Smith,"Yes. He is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of Lehi again. He's... we must now translate from the plate of Nephi. So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently.
"
7,12,Harris,"Wow! If God got angry with you, then you must be tellin' the truth.
"
7,12,Singers,"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.
"
7,12,Harris,"All right, Martin. Let's get to work! 
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"And that's how it happened.
"
7,12,Kids,"Yeah! All right! 
"
7,12,Stan,"...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't it?
"
7,12,Stan,"No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?
"
7,12,Mark,"Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.
"
7,12,Stan,"No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!
"
7,12,Randy,"Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.
"
7,12,Stan,"I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!
"
7,12,Shelly,"Me neither.
"
7,12,Gary,"Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs.
"
7,12,Gary,"Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!
"
7,12,Stan,"Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
"
7,12,Randy,"Yeah! 
"
7,12,Gary Sr.,"Well kids... Who's up for a water balloon fight?!
"
7,12,Kids,"Yeah! All right! 
"
7,12,Kyle,"Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?
"
7,12,Stan,"I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.
"
7,12,Cartman,"Oh no! You guys broke up?
"
7,12,Stan,"You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.
"
7,12,Gary,"Hey Stan.
"
7,12,Stan,"Oh brother.
"
7,12,Cartman,"Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.
"
7,12,Gary,"Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore.
"
7,12,Stan,"I don't?
"
7,12,Gary,"Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls. 
"
7,12,Cartman,"Damn, that kid is cool, huh?
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids, can I have it quiet, please? M'kay? M'kay, quiet now, the assembly's about to start, m'kay. M'kay, quiet ple-mk-m'kay?  M'kay. Uh, now kids, we have a really fun motivational group today who are gonna talk to you about the dangers of smoking, m'kay? So please give a very big South Park Cows welcome to, ""Butt Out!"" 
"
7,13,Butt Out!,"Butt out! Yeah yeah! Kids, that cigarette butt is gross!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go! 
"
7,13,Kyle,"Oh no...
"
7,13,Butt Out!,"Yeah! All right! Woohoo!!
"
7,13,Butt Out! Lady,"Hey students, how are we all feelin' today? Woooo! 
"
7,13,Butt Out! Man 1,"Hey, did you guys know that each year over six hundred thousand people a year die from smoking? A year!
"
7,13,Butt Out! Man 2,"Six hundred thousand?? Are you sure you're not just blowing smoke? 
"
7,13,Butt Out! Lady,"Blow smoke? Us? No way! Because we don't need to smoke and neither do you, right kids? Butt out! Break it down! 
"
7,13,Butt Out!,"Butt out! Yeah yeah! It's cool to say no!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go!
"
7,13,Butt Out! Man 3,"Smoking, no. No smoking. 
"
7,13,Butt Out! Man 2,"Freestyle!
"
7,13,Butt Out! Lady,"Vernon! 
"
7,13,Vernon,"Don't smoke! Don't ever smoke!
"
7,13,Butt Out!,"Kyle!

7,13,Kyle,"Dude, this is unbearable.
"
7,13,Cartman,"I'm going to kill myself. 
"
7,13,Butt Out!,"Randy!
"
7,13,Randy,"Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the ""no"" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it!
"
7,13,Butt Out!,"Pam!
"
7,13,Pam,"Dooooonttt smooooke.
"
7,13,Butt Out!,"Woohoo! 
"
7,13,Cartman,"You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. 
"
7,13,Butt Out!'s Kyle,"Hey! What's the big deal? I like smoking, and it makes me cool! 
"
7,13,Pam,"Ohoh, really?? Do you think lung cancer is cool, too?? 
"
7,13,Randy,"What about emphysema?? Is that cool?? 
"
7,13,Vernon,"And what about abortion, and AIDS? 
"
7,13,Randy,"Pfft! That's none's the cool.
"
7,13,Pam,"Word.
"
7,13,Vernon,"Yeah. So butt out! 
"
7,13,Butt Out!,"Butt out! Yeah yeah! Give that cigarette butt a throw!
"
7,13,Stan,"Ugh, Jesus Christ! 
"
7,13,Butt Out!,"Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go!
"
7,13,Vernon,"Remember, kids, if you smoke, you could grow up to be a failure.
"
7,13,Pan,"Worse yet, you could grow up to be dead. 
"
7,13,Butt Out!'s Kyle,"So don't believe what those evil tobacco companies tell you!
"
7,13,Randy,"Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-
"
7,13,Butt Out!,"Just Like Us. 
"
7,13,Stan,"Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. 
"
7,13,Kyle,"Aw dude, this is really hard.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. 
"
7,13,Kyle,"Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"Boys, what are you doing back here?  I asked you a question: What are you doing back here, 'k?!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Nothing.
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"What??
"
7,13,Cartman,"Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. 
"
7,13,Kyle,"D'awww sick! 
"
7,13,Cartman,"Gross dude! 
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"Well hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys have been smoking!
"
7,13,Cartman,"No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"Well you'd better not! Because let me tell you some'n' about smokin'!  Uh, smokin's bad, m'kay.  And uh, if you start smokin' at an early age, m'kay, ih it's gonna be bad.  M'kay, because uh, smoking can lead to all kinds of health problems like cancer.  M'kay, and let me tell you something about cancer, m'kay. Cancer's bad. M'kay, and uh, eh, what?  What the?  Holy shit! M'kay?! 
"
7,13,Mr. Slave,"Oh! Jesus Christ! 
"
7,13,Stan,"...Whoops.
"
7,13,Principal Victoria,"Well, you boys have certainly done it this time!
"
7,13,Cartman,"We're sorry.
"
7,13,Principal Victoria,"Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now. 
"
7,13,Kyle,"Oh God... 
"
7,13,Principal Victoria,"Come on in. 
"
7,13,Sharon,"Stanley, what did you do this time?!
"
7,13,Principal Victoria,"You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking!
"
7,13,Sheila,"Smoking?
"
7,13,Sharon,"No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker! 
"
7,13,Stan,"Mom...  Dad, it was just a-
"
7,13,Randy,"I don't have a son!
"
7,13,Liane,"Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?
"
7,13,Gerald,"Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you?
"
7,13,Sheila,"Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault
"
7,13,Kyle,"Yeah. This is really their fault.
"
7,13,Sheila,"No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Yeah, huh?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!
"
7,13,Liane,"Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie?
"
7,13,Randy,"Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!
"
7,13,Sheila,"We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.
"
7,13,Kyle,"Who's Rob Reiner?
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"I don't understand it. I pushed a law for higher taxes on cigarettes, I lobbied to get images of cigarettes removed from movies and art, I forced smokers out of bars and parks, but still I get letters from parents saying their kids are doin' it.  Apparently, people still don't understand how bad smoking people is for them. Don't they know how dangerous it is to their health?  Don't they know the hazard of second-hand smoke?
"
7,13,Executive 1,"According to the letter, sir, the town has a tobacco company quite near them.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Yeah, that must be it.  The tobacco companies, with their millions of dollars and their slick desks and fancy buildings,  they're the ones making music wanna smoke!  They're the ones hurting our nation's health! I will not stand by and see the children of America corrupted by those bastards!  This is war!!
"
7,13,Kyle,"You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
"
7,13,Stan,"Hwat??
"
7,13,Cartman,"Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
"
7,13,Stan,"Yeah, what's the problem?
"
7,13,Kyle,"Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
"
7,13,Cartman,"Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
"
7,13,Stan,"Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.
"
7,13,Mr. Garrison,"Here he comes! 
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Damnit.  Butter!  Butter! 
"
7,13,Mr. Garrison,"What'd he say?
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Butter!!  Hello South Park!!  It is so nice to see an entire town come together to fight for good health! And I'm gonna help ya!  These poor innocent children have been seduced into smoking tobacco. So I say, ""We fight fire with fire!"" We're gonna use these children to bring the tobacco companies down! 
"
7,13,Kyle,"Oh no...
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Alright kids, here's what we're gonna do.  We're gonna sneak you into the tobacco company by saying you kids want a tour for a school paper.  Once you're inside, mm, mm, I'm gonna take photos and then we'll publish them, saying that the tobacco company invited you over to seduce you into smoking. Got it?
"
7,13,Cartman,"Got it! 
"
7,13,Kyle,"But... isn't that, kind of, lying?
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Mm.  Uh, we're just leveling out the playing field.  The tobacco companies lie to you about the dangers of smoking. If we're gonna take them down, we've gotta lie right back!  Oh my God!  Excuse me!
"
7,13,BUDS Man,"Yes?
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Would you mind putting that death stick out?!
"
7,13,BUDS Man,"But, uh, this is a bar.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Isn't smoking illegal in bars here?
"
7,13,Bartender,"Not in Colorado
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Oh my God! What kind of backward hick state is this?!
"
7,13,BUDS Man,"Look man, I work fourteen hours a day at the saw mill. I just got off work and I need to relax.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Well when I relax I just go to my vacation house in Hawaii!
"
7,13,BUDS Man,"I ain't got a vacation house in Hawaii!
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Yuh your vacation house in Mexico, then, whatever it is! Look, you are putting my life and these boys' lives in danger by smoking that in here! And I'm not gonna tolerate it! I will end smoking in bars in Colorado! There will be no more smoking here!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Isn't he awesome, you guys?
"
7,13,Kyle,"What??
"
7,13,Cartman,"Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. 
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"All right boys, just do what I tell ya and we'll be able to sue this tobacco company for two billion dollars!  As soon as we get into the main facility, I'll snap the photo of you kids, and we can all run out! Think you can handle it?
"
7,13,Cartman,"Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Heh, great.  Okay, now watch yourselves, kids. These tobacco company people will do anything to get you hooked on smoking. They are liars and they are frauds!
"
7,13,Receptionist,"Can I help you?
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Yes. My name is Rita Poon. I called about my boys wanting a tour.
"
7,13,Executive,"Ah, yes, Mrs. Poon. My name's Kevin Harris and I'm the vice president of Big Tobacco.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Oh. Hello, Mr. Harris.
"
7,13,Kevin Harris,"Well, come on in.  How about a little history first?  Native Americans were the first to cultivate the tobacco plant. They smoked it in pipes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Not if I were around, they wouldn't have.
"
7,13,Kevin Harris,"Excuse me?
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Oh, nothing! Please continue.
"
7,13,Kevin Harris,"The first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in Virginia in 1612.  Within seven years it was one of the country's largest exports.
"
7,13,Kyle,"So, tobacco helped to build America.
"
7,13,Kevin Harris,"That's right. Over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from Africa to help work the fields.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
"
7,13,Kevin Harris,"And so for centuries, tobacco production flourished. Nobody was even aware of any dangers back then, until, in 1965,  when Congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon General's warning on their packages. So now, everyone knows the dangers of smoking. And some people still choose to do it, and we believe that's what being an American is all about.
"
7,13,Kyle,"That sound perfectly reasonable.
"
7,13,Kevin Harris,"And here's our factory at work. 
"
7,13,Factory workers,"With a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lay
We work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey day
So folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey lives
And relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night
"
7,13,Young Worker,"I like to have a cigarette every now and then 
It makes me fee-l calmer when the day is at an end. 
"
7,13,Older Worker,"And if it gives me cancer when I'm eighty I don't care
Who the hell wants to be ninety anyway?
"
7,13,Factory workers,"So with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lay
We work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey day
So folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey lives
And relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night
"
7,13,Kevin Harris,"Well, I guess that's the end of our tour.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Oh, here boys. Let me get your picture.  Got it! Ha! You bastards are going down now!
"
7,13,Kevin Harris,"What??
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"I'm not Rita Poon! I'm Rob Reiner!  And you've just been Reinered! Come on boys, let's make our escape!  Don't you try and stop us! 
"
7,13,Kevin Harris,"Oh my God!
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Hoh boy, that was great, kids.
"
7,13,Stan,"Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Hah, you see that? They got into your head. Now you kids can meet some good, decent people, the folks who work to get smoking banned!
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"This is how we get rid of smokers.  We go state to state and do things like, use bogus studies and make extensive commercials to get the public on our side and force cigarette smokers to stop!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Here you go Bob.  This is Mr. Baffrey. He does all our Photoshop work.  Now, all we have to do is Photoshop cigarettes into your hands!  And bingo! When this hits the papers the tobacco company is screwed! Hahahaha! 
"
7,13,Kyle,"But dude, you're making stuff up.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"You kids need to understand something, okay? Sometimes lying is okay. Like, when you know what's good for people more than they do.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!
"
7,13,Worker,"Mr. Reiner, your bill to have smoking outlawed at bars here didn't pass.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"What?!  God-damnit, what the hell is wrong with people in this state?!
"
7,13,Worker,"Apparently, several people here still believe there's no proof second-hand smoke can kill you.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Well they want proof?! All right, we'll give them proof! Boys, I need one of you to act in a commercial for us! We'll shoot it tomorrow!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Wow, a commercial?
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"And you boys decide which one of you will be best for the part. All right people, we've gotta get moving on the bill to ban smoking in Potsdam! Let's go!
"
7,13,Cartman,"God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
"
7,13,Kyle,"Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
"
7,13,Stan,"Huh?
"
7,13,Kyle,"This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
"
7,13,Kenny,"(Well yep, that's what I think.)
"
7,13,Stan,"Yeah, maybe you're right. 
"
7,13,Cartman,"So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
"
7,13,Kyle,"Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
"
7,13,Kyle,"No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, ""How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. 
"
7,13,Cartman,"Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- 
"
7,13,Kyle,"What are you doing? 
"
7,13,Cartman,"Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.
"
7,13,Kyle,"Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
"
7,13,Cartman,"Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Okay Eric, this is going to be real simple. All you gotta do is read the words on the TelePrompTer here. 
"
7,13,Cartman,"Heh, ho-okay. 
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Let's see how the tobacco companies deal with this.  All right, roll camera. Roll the TelePrompTer. And whenever you're ready, Eric.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"And cut! Great! We got it! Wrap it up, people. That was fantastic.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Uh what... what does that mean, ""I'll be dead""? Hey, uh what, what was that ""dead"" part?
"
7,13,Scary Assistant,"That was very good, Eric. Here, eat this cupcake.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.
"
7,13,Scary Assistant,"But you are. Just eat this one cupcake. It has... sprinkles.
"
7,13,Cartman,"I'm not eating the cupcake.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Eric, do you know what a hero is? A hero is somebody who sacrifices himself for the good of others. You can be a hero, Eric. All you have to do... is eat the cupcake. 
"
7,13,Cartman,"Jesus Christ! HAAAA!
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Hey! 
"
7,13,Stan,"What are you doing, Cartman?
"
7,13,Cartman,"They're going to kill me! 
"
7,13,Kyle,"Who's going to kill you?
"
7,13,Cartman,"The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
"
7,13,Stan,"Well, get away from us then.
"
7,13,Kyle,"Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. 
"
7,13,Cartman,"You guys have to help me!
"
7,13,Kyle,"No dude, get away!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!
"
7,13,Stan,"Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!
"
7,13,Cartman,"If I go, you guys go!
"
7,13,Stan,"Daaaad!
"
7,13,Randy,"What?
"
7,13,Stan,"Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.
"
7,13,Randy,"Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. 
"
7,13,Cartman,"Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! 
"
7,13,Stan,"Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?
"
7,13,Kyle,"Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! 
"
7,13,Kyle,"Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.
"
7,13,Kenny,"(Uh huh.)
"
7,13,Cartman,"You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.
"
7,13,Stan,"Oh all right.
"
7,13,Kyle,"No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
"
7,13,Stan,"Why?
"
7,13,Kyle,"Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
"
7,13,Stan,"So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. 
"
7,13,Kyle,"God-damnit! 
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Give us the child!
"
7,13,Kevin Harris,"We will not!
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"There, you see that?! The tobacco company won't give us the kid! And do you know why?! Because they know that if they give us that kid, then we'll kill him! And when our commercial goes on the air, it will lose them business!
"
7,13,Townspeople,"Yeah! Yeah, that's right!
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"Wait a minute, what?
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Yeah. When we kill the kid, people are gonna think it's because of second-hand smoke! And then these bastards are all gonna make money, and they know it! 
"
7,13,Randy,"Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"Oh, God-damnit, do I have to explain this again?! Smoking is bad, people! So if we have to be a little extreme to stop it, it's okay!
"
7,13,Kyle,"No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.
"
7,13,Stan,"Yup.
"
7,13,Kyle,"You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"GOD-DAMNIT THERE'LL BE NO MORE SMOKING!!
"
7,13,Stan,"It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"You're right, boys, m'kay?
"
7,13,BUDS Man,"Yeah. Let smokers smoke.
"
7,13,Townspeople,"Yeah!!
"
7,13,Mr. Garrison,"Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out! 
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"I'm warning you: don't mess with anti-smoking groups!
"
7,13,Cartman,"I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! 
"
7,13,Rob Reiner,"My goo! My precious goo! 
"
7,13,Sheila,"So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke?
"
7,13,Kyle,"No.
"
7,13,Sheila,"Well then, you are grounded, mister!
"
7,13,Liane,"You too, Eric.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Aw awww!
"
7,13,Stan,"Well, I guess we learned our lesson.
"
7,13,Kyle,"No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! 
"
7,14,Stan,"All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
"
7,14,Cartman,"Right. What are we playing again?
"
7,14,Stan,"Football.
"
7,14,Cartman,"Got it. 
"
7,14,Stan,"Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! 
"
7,14,Bebe,"Wendy breaks up.
"
7,14,Stan,"What? 
"
7,14,Bebe,"Wendy breaks up with you. 
"
7,14,Stan,"Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  
"
7,14,Bebe,"She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. 
"
7,14,Cartman,"What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
"
7,14,Bebe,"Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!
"
7,14,Butters,"Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
"
7,14,Cartman,"Yeh-heah, right!
"
7,14,Bebe,"God, you're so stupid! 
"
7,14,Cartman,"What a whore! 
"
7,14,Kyle,"Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
"
7,14,Cartman,"Come on, Stan, it's first down still. 
"
7,14,Stan,"Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
"
7,14,Kyle,"Why?
"
7,14,Stan,"'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
"
7,14,Stan,"Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
"
7,14,Kyle,"God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 
"
7,14,Wendy,"Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.
"
7,14,Kyle,"'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
"
7,14,Stan,"What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.
"
7,14,Kyle,"No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 
"
7,14,Stan,"Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy!
"
7,14,Jimmy,"Hey Stan.
"
7,14,Stan,"Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
"
7,14,Jimmy,"For- Forw- Forw-w-w what?
"
7,14,Stan,"Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.
"
7,14,Jimmy,"She's what?
"
7,14,Stan,"She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
"
7,14,Jimmy,"...Okay.  Hey uh-Wen, hey wu-Wendy. 
"
7,14,Wendy,"Yeah?
"
7,14,Jimmy,"Stan says you're a cont... you're a- cont- S-Stan says you're a cont- cont-
"
7,14,Wendy,"Well tell Stan to fuck off!! 
"
7,14,Stan,"Well?
"
7,14,Jimmy,"She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over. 
"
7,14,Stan,"Over?  Jesus...
"
7,14,Butters,"We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
"
7,14,Stan,"...Go away.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
"
7,14,Stan,"Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
"
7,14,Cartman,"God, what a fag!
"
7,14,Kyle,"Dude, not now! 
"
7,14,Stan,"You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
"
7,14,Kyle,"Jeez, he's worse than I thought.
"
7,14,Butters,"Well what do we do now?
"
7,14,Jimmy,"Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
"
7,14,Kyle,"No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
"
7,14,Butters,"What's Raisins?
"
7,14,Blonde,"Hey guys, welcome to Raisins. Six of you?  Right over here. 
"
7,14,Redhead,"So you guys having a good time today?
"
7,14,Diners,"Uh huh...
"
7,14,Blonde 2,"How about some more fun fries, guys?
"
7,14,Diners,"Okay... 
"
7,14,Brunette,"Boy, am I glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
"
7,14,Blonde,"Here you go, guys. Lexus will be right with you.
"
7,14,Kyle,"What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
"
7,14,Jimmy,"Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven.
"
7,14,Butters,"This place is awesome!
"
7,14,Cartman,"How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Hey guys.
"
7,14,Butters,"Whoa!
"
7,14,Lexus,"How are we doing this afternoon?
"
7,14,The Boys,"Good.
"
7,14,Lexus,"I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
"
7,14,Butters,"W-we are.
"
7,14,Lexus,"So what can I get you?
"
7,14,Cartman,"Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Great. I'll put your order in right now. 
"
7,14,Butters,"You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
"
7,14,Lexus,"Raisins, girls! 
"
7,14,Blonde 3,"Woohoo!
"
7,14,Redhead,"Oh Yeah!
"
7,14,Brunette 2,"Do it!
"
7,14,Kyle,"Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 
"
7,14,Brunette 3,"Hi guys. My name's Porsche.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Hey. Uh, this is Stan.
"
7,14,Porsche,"Oh hey cutie. How are you? I love your hat. I used to have a hat juuust like that, except, it was black and it didn't have a puffball on it. Oh my God, my hands are sooo cold. How come people have hands, anyway? Did you ever wonder that? 
"
7,14,Raisins Girls,"YMCA...  YMCA-A.
"
7,14,Cartman,"Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... 
"
7,14,Porsche,"Have you ever noticed how much sand there is at the beach? I mean, haven't you ever wondered where all this sand came from? Omigod, this one time, I saw a beetle that was thiiis big. Eeewww!
"
7,14,Stan,"Can we go, please?
"
7,14,Kyle,"Okay. Okay, come on you guys. 
"
7,14,Porsche,"Oooh my God, thank you guys sooo much for coming to Raisins! 
"
7,14,Lexus,"Oooh, sweetie, are you leaving?
"
7,14,Butters,"Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see you again??
"
7,14,Butters,"When do you wanna see me?
"
7,14,Lexus,"As soon as possible!
"
7,14,Butters,"Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 
"
7,14,Lexus,"Oooh, you are such a sweetie. Come here, youuu! 
"
7,14,Butters,"Waa... ahaaah... 
"
7,14,Raisins Girl,"Bye, guys! Thanks for coming to Raisins!
"
7,14,Jimmy,"Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now?
"
7,14,Stan,"No, dude, I feel worse!
"
7,14,Kyle,"Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
"
7,14,Stan,"Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
"
7,14,Butters,"She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
"
7,14,Stan,"I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! 
"
7,14,Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
7,14,Stan,"Something I should have done a long time ago. 
"
7,14,Stan,"Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!
"
7,14,Bebe,"Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of.
"
7,14,Stan,"Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
"
7,14,Bebe,"If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play  Peter Gabriel.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Okay, Porsche, see you tomorrow. Bye, Mercedes.
"
7,14,Butters,"Lexus! 
"
7,14,Lexus,"Uh oh. Uh, hi, sweetie.
"
7,14,Butters,"I waited all night for you to get off work.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Oh, really?  Huhunh, that's great. Uhm, Maury...
"
7,14,Butters,"I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
"
7,14,Maury,"There a problem?
"
7,14,Lexus,"Could you uh just help walk me to my- bike?
"
7,14,Maury,"Right. 
"
7,14,Lexus,"Thanks again for the big tip. You are such a sweetie. Come back and see me real soon, okay? 
"
7,14,Butters,"Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Oh wow. Thanks, cutie.
"
7,14,Butters,"It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 
"
7,14,Lexus,"Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten all night. Thank you.  Well I gotta go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins and see me again, okaaay? 
"
7,14,Butters,"Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Oh gee, that would be great, honey, but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell you what: you come back to Raisins and then we'll be able to hang out all we want, okay? 
"
7,14,Butters,"O-kay!
"
7,14,Lexus,"Bye, cutie!
"
7,14,Butters,"Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life relationship.
"
7,14,Mr. Garrison,"All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. 
"
7,14,Kyle,"Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.
"
7,14,Stan,"I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
"
7,14,Stan,"There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
"
7,14,Stan,"Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
"
7,14,Pete,"Life is pain. Life is only pain.  We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings.  But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that  eats at your soul.
"
7,14,Michael,"Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad. Why should it work for me?
"
7,14,Henrietta,"My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.
"
7,14,Firkle,"They're all a bunch of Nazi conformists cheerleaders. 
"
7,14,Stan,"But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
"
7,14,Pete,"Just to make life more miserable for the conformists. 
"
7,14,Stan,"All right, so how do I join you?
"
7,14,Michael,"If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do.
"
7,14,Stan,"...'K.
"
7,14,Mercedes,"Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you.
"
7,14,Ferrari,"Okay.
"
7,14,Mercedes,"First of all, there's a five foot rule. If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. ""Hey,  cutie.""  When you're not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun.  We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins.  Now, when you take a customer's order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. ""Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in."" If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. ""I'll be right back with your order, guys."" 
"
7,14,Ferrari,"Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes.
"
7,14,Mercedes,"Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open for business. Good luck.  Go ahead and open for business, Porsche!
"
7,14,Porsche,"Okay! 
"
7,14,Raisins Girl,"Hi, welcome to Raisins!
"
7,14,Butters,"Hi! Is Lexus here?
"
7,14,Lexus,"Hey, cutie.
"
7,14,Butters,"Darling!
"
7,14,Lexus,"How are we doing today?
"
7,14,Butters,"Oh God. I missed you so much.
"
7,14,Henrietta,"Shallow life.
Drowning alone, I gasp for air.
Coldness creeps over pale skin.
There is sadness so deep it pulls me down
Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea.
"
7,14,Pete,"Yeah, happiness dies. 
"
7,14,Stan,"Yeah.
"
7,14,Michael,"All right, your turn, Stan. Read one of your poems about pain.
"
7,14,Stan,"There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.
"
7,14,Henrietta,"Whoa.
"
7,14,Stan,"The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-
"
7,14,Pete,"Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!
"
7,14,Stan,"They're not?
"
7,14,Michael,"No, dude! You can't say ""I miss you so much, babe. I want to hold you in my arms.""
"
7,14,Henrietta,"Make it ""I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades.""
"
7,14,Henrietta's Mom,"Henrietta! Hi sweetie!
"
7,14,Henrietta,"Go away Mom! Leave me alone!
"
7,14,Henrietta's Mom,"Daddy and I just got your birthday present! But you can't see what it is till tomorrow!
"
7,14,Henrietta,"You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face.
"
7,14,Henrietta's Mom,"Ee-you are so creative, honey.
"
7,14,Henrietta,"Conformist bitch.
"
7,14,Other Goths,"Yeah.
"
7,14,Porsche,"Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Porsche. Have you tried our Double Whammy Wings?
"
7,14,Butters,"Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 
"
7,14,Lexus,"Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Lexus.
"
7,14,Butters,"Hey Lexus.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Hi, sweetie! Who's this?
"
7,14,Butters,"Wuh it's me, Butters.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Oh, okay. Hi, cutie.  Hey sweetie.  So how are you, honey?
"
7,14,Butters,"I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
"
7,14,Lexus,"Good, good.
"
7,14,Butters,"Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie.  Why don't you just come down to Raisins?
"
7,14,Butters,"Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Awww, that's too bad, cutie. I really wanna see you.
"
7,14,Butters,"Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
"
7,14,Lexus,"'K sugar. Gotta run.
"
7,14,Butters,"Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
"
7,14,Butters,"Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
"
7,14,Stephen,"O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago. 
"
7,14,Butters,"Uh but I spent it all.
"
7,14,Linda,"What are you spending all that money on, Butters?
"
7,14,Butters,"On my girlfriend.
"
7,14,Stephen,"Girlfriend?
"
7,14,Linda,"You... have a girlfriend, Butters?
"
7,14,Butters,"Yeah.
"
7,14,Chris,"And she's... a... girl, right?
"
7,14,Butters,"Yup!
"
7,14,Chris,"Well all right! Good for you, Butters!
"
7,14,Linda,"Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?
"
7,14,Butters,"Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
"
7,14,Stephen,"Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.
"
7,14,Butters,"Okay. 
"
7,14,Stephen,"You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay.
"
7,14,Linda,"All right, you win.
"
7,14,Michael,"Hey, can we get more coffee over here?
"
7,14,Waitress,"Damn it, are you kids just gonna sit here all night again and drink six dollars' work of coffee?! Why don't you get a life?! 
"
7,14,Michael,"Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race life, living paycheck to paycheck for corporate gains.
"
7,14,Other Goths,"Yeah.
"
7,14,Pete,"Dude, you haven't drank your coffee. 
"
7,14,Stan,"Well I don't drink coffee.
"
7,14,Pete,"You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. 
"
7,14,Kyle,"Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
"
7,14,Stan,"Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. 
"
7,14,Kyle,"God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
"
7,14,Stan,"So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
"
7,14,Pete,"Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole?  You just don't know what real pain is.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
"
7,14,Pete,"I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
"
7,14,Stan,"What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
"
7,14,Kyle,"Yeah. She is.
"
7,14,Stan,"Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
"
7,14,Henrietta,"For sure.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
"
7,14,Stan,"...conformist.
"
7,14,Other Goths,"Yeah.
"
7,14,Butters,"Here we are, Mom and Dad! 
"
7,14,Mercedes,"Hi, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?
"
7,14,Butters,"Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
"
7,14,Mercedes,"Great.  Be sure to try our Cheddar Poppers. Right this way. 
"
7,14,Raisins Girl,"Who else wants a signed Raisins Girls calendar for five dollars? 
"
7,14,Diners,"Woohoo, all right, yeah! 
"
7,14,Linda,"Stephen, what is this place?
"
7,14,Stephen,"I, don't know.
"
7,14,Mercedes,"Here you go. Porsche will by right with you. 
"
7,14,Butters,"Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! 
"
7,14,Raisins Girl,"Hey cutie, you having a good time?
"
7,14,Boy,"Yeah.
"
7,14,Stephen,"Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money.
"
7,14,Linda,"This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.
"
7,14,Porsche,"Hi guys. Can I take your order?
"
7,14,Linda,"Little girl, you shouldn't be working here.
"
7,14,Porsche,"I shouldn't? Where I supposed to be working?
"
7,14,Linda,"No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.
"
7,14,Porsche,"I could cure cancer? Omigod! That would be sooo cool! I had a cancer sore on my lip once and it hurt sooo bad.
"
7,14,Linda,"... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.
"
7,14,Porsche,"Cool! 
"
7,14,Butters,"Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.
"
7,14,Lexus,"Hi. Welcome to Raisins.
"
7,14,Stephen,"Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?
"
7,14,Butters,"Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
"
7,14,Linda,"Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.
"
7,14,Butters,"Huh?
"
7,14,Stephen,"You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.
"
7,14,Butters,"Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
"
7,14,Lexus,"What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.
"
7,14,Butters,"... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
"
7,14,Lexus,"I'm sorry, sweetie.
"
7,14,Butters,"So that's it? We're broken up now?
"
7,14,Lexus,"I gotta get these curly fries to Table 12. 
"
7,14,Butters,"Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
"
7,14,Goth Voice,"Look at this. Another tortured soul. Another life of pain.  Hey Raven, check it out. 
"
7,14,Stan,"Butters?
"
7,14,Butters,"Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.
"
7,14,Stan,"What's the matter with you?
"
7,14,Butters,"Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
"
7,14,Henrietta,"Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?
"
7,14,Butters,"Yeah.  It sure does hurt.
"
7,14,Michael,"That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want.
"
7,14,Pete,"Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
"
7,14,Butters,"Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
"
7,14,Stan,"Huh? But you just got dumped
"
7,14,Butters,"Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
"
7,14,Pete,"Yeah.
"
7,14,Stan,"No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
"
7,14,Butters,"Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 
"
7,14,Stan,"He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. 
"
7,14,Michael,"Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!
"
7,14,Kyle,"Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
"
7,14,Stan,"Hey, can I join in? 
"
7,14,Kyle,"What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
"
7,14,Stan,"Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy. 
"
7,14,Kyle,"Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
"
7,14,Stan,"Yeah. Let's play ball.
"
7,15,The Broflovskis,"Chanukah, Chanukah, sivivon, sov, sov
"
7,15,Ike,"I gotta go tinkle.
"
7,15,Kyle,"No Ike! Shh!
"
7,15,The Broflovskis,"Sov, sov, sov! Sov, sov, sov! Ma nayim vi-tov.
"
7,15,Gerald,"We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.  I'll get it. 
"
7,15,Man,"Gerald Broflovski?
"
7,15,Gerald,"Yes?
"
7,15,Man,"My name is Harry Gints and this is my wife Elise. We're from Canada.
"
7,15,Gerald,"Yes, I can tell.
"
7,15,Harry,"My wife and I had a child a few years back, and, we weren't ready to have a child, so we put him up for adoption.  We were told that you might be the-
"
7,15,Elise,"Peter!  Oh God, Harry! It's our son!  Peter, it's Mommy.
"
7,15,Sheila,"Gerald, what the hell is going on?
"
7,15,Gerald,"I I'm not sure.
"
7,15,Harry,"It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada. The whole country was devastated by the cola wars. It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby.
"
7,15,Elise,"So we put him up for adoption. But as the years passed, I, I just felt an emptiness in my heart.  Oh it's so good to see him.
"
7,15,Sheila,"Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.
"
7,15,Elise,"I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter, we came to take him back.
"
7,15,Gerald,"What?
"
7,15,Harry,"We want to take Peter home, to Canada.
"
7,15,Sheila,"Are you crazy?!
"
7,15,Gerald,"Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.
"
7,15,Harry,"Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear. And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home.
"
7,15,Sheila,"The new Canadian Prime Minister?
"
7,15,Gerald,"Look, Ike is our son now!
"
7,15,Harry,"He doesn't belong here. He belongs in Canada with his own kind.
"
7,15,Sheila,"I think you'd better leave.
"
7,15,Harry,"Please, don't make things any harder for Peter.
"
7,15,Gerald,"Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!
"
7,15,Harry,"We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that!
"
7,15,Gerald,"Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!
"
7,15,Judge,"I'm sorry to say that my hands are tied. The new Prime Minister of Canada has authority this court cannot override. By Canadian law I must award custody of the child to his birth parents.
"
7,15,The Gintses,"Yes!
"
7,15,Elise,"Yes!
"
7,15,Sheila,"No!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Ike's not my little brother anymore?
"
7,15,Sheila,"Gerald, do something!
"
7,15,Gerald,"There's nothing I can do.
"
7,15,Gerald,"Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. 
"
7,15,Kyle,"Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
"
7,15,Harry,"Come on, Peter, we should get going.
"
7,15,Ike,"No!
"
7,15,Elise,"Peter, you must come with Mommy and Daddy.
"
7,15,Ike,"No no no no no!
"
7,15,Harry,"I have some chocolate.
"
7,15,Ike,"Chocolate! 
"
7,15,Harry,"We're going to take good care of him.
"
7,15,Kyle,"You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-
"
7,15,Gerald,"Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
"
7,15,Stan,"Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Guys.  Guys, I need your help.
"
7,15,Stan,"Sure dude.
"
7,15,Kyle,"It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
"
7,15,Cartman,"We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
"
7,15,Stan,"Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
"
7,15,Kyle,"Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.
"
7,15,Stan,"Dude, Cartman.
"
7,15,Cartman,"I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
"
7,15,Kyle,"I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
"
7,15,Stan,"Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 
"
7,15,Cartman,"Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. 
"
7,15,Crowd,"Three! Two! One!  Yaaaaay!
"
7,15,Mayor McDaniels,"As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help?
"
7,15,Mr. Garrison,"How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans? 
"
7,15,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you ""NO!""
"
7,15,Mr. Garrison,"Rats!
"
7,15,Chef,"The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?
"
7,15,Cartman,"HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
"
7,15,Liane,"That's a great idea, Chef.
"
7,15,Cartman,"What?
"
7,15,Randy,"Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!
"
7,15,Stan,"Dad, don't get carried away.
"
7,15,Mayor McDaniels,"Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them. 
"
7,15,Cartman,"No! No, this can't be happening! 
"
7,15,Cartman,"You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
"
7,15,Kyle,"What?
"
7,15,Cartman,"Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! 
"
7,15,Stan,"Whoa whoa, Cartman.
"
7,15,Cartman,"It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
"
7,15,Stan,"Cartman, calm down!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Is that true?
"
7,15,Stan,"It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.
"
7,15,Cartman,"This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
"
7,15,Kyle,"I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
"
7,15,Cartman,"You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
"
7,15,Kyle,"It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
"
7,15,Stan,"Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
"
7,15,Kyle,"We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"No business... Christmastime come anda nobody wanna eata Chinese food. Looks like I might as well close.  Oh boy! Some business!  Finally!  Herro? Shitty Wok, take ur orda prease!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Oh, oh yes, just a moment prease.  Herro, Shitty Airrines. Can I help you take ur orda prease?
"
7,15,Kyle,"Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Oooh, Canada. Okay, that's uh pretty far. Gonna cost ya a rot of money... hmlet's she. How many people?
"
7,15,Kyle,"Four.
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Okay. Four people, Canada, cost a rot of money, that uh gonna be about ah six thousand five hundred daura.
"
7,15,Kyle,"How about fifty daura?
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Fifty daura?! You flighn to Canada cost at reast three thousand daura!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Fifty-five daura.
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Hey! Stop wasting my time wa fifty-five daura! No way I take my plane to Canada for less than a thousand daura!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Okay. Sixty daura.
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Sixty-two daura.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Okay.
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Okay. Meet me Park County Airfield, yellow Cessna, tail number 432G.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Got it. 
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Hehehehe, never try to barter with a Chinese man.
"
7,15,Cartman,"We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Herro, welcome Shitty Airrine. 
"
7,15,Cartman,"Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!
"
7,15,Kenny,"(Me neither!)
"
7,15,Kyle,"Why not?
"
7,15,Kenny,"('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!)
"
7,15,Kyle,"You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
"
7,15,Cartman,"You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
"
7,15,Stan,"No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
"
7,15,Cartman,"Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! 
"
7,15,Cartman,"Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Okay, welcome aboard Shitty Airrines. This is your captain speaking. Rooking about a two hour fright. I'll be turning on the seatbelt sign now. If your seats have seatbelts, this is the time you will fasten them. Please sit back, relax, and enjoy your Shitty fright. 
"
7,15,Kyle,"All right! We're going to Canada!
"
7,15,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Hey, turn off the right. ...Wha- oh! 
"
7,15,Stan,"What's going on??
"
7,15,Mr. Kim,"Herro from the cockpit, this is your captain speaking. As you can see, it appears that we are goin' down. Now would be a good time to refrect on your rife, and pray to whatever deity you bereive in. Thank you for flying Shitty Airlines. We know you have a choice in airlines, and it looks like you made the wrong one. 
"
7,15,Kyle,"Hey, where the hell are you going?? 
"
7,15,Stan,"Do something, Kyle! 
"
7,15,Kyle,"I'm trying! 
"
7,15,Cartman,"Look out!
"
7,15,Kenny,"(N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!) 
"
7,15,Stan,"You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. 
"
7,15,Canadian Man,"Eh-xcuse me?  Uh, is this an invasion?
"
7,15,Kyle,"No.
"
7,15,Canadian Man,"Oh thank heavens! It's okay. Everyone, it's not an invasion! 
"
7,15,Kyle,"Hey! We're in Canada!
"
7,15,Doctor,"Well of course you are! And Canada Friends welcomes you!
"
7,15,Canadians,"Welcome, friend, to Canada! Canada Friends loves you!We're just like any other country without the big tattoo!
"
7,15,Sailor,"We greet thee with pleasure, but one question, if we may?
"
7,15,Businessman,"What brings you folks to Canada? Why are you here today?
"
7,15,Kyle,"Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
"
7,15,Canadians,"His brother is our quest. The question is, is what? You must talk to the new Prime Minister if you think his brother's home's back there.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Oh Jesus Christ.
"
7,15,Scott,"Hey! What the hell is going on?!
"
7,15,Canadians,"It's Scott! AAAAHHHH! 
"
7,15,Scott,"Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Who's that?
"
7,15,Doctor,"That's Scott! He's a dick!
"
7,15,Scott,"A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now!
"
7,15,Doctor,"Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these boys alone!
"
7,15,Scott,"This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!! 
"
7,15,Man in Barrel,"God, what a dick!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
"
7,15,Doctor,"The new Prime Minister doesn't live in this part of Canada. He's in Ottawa. 
"
7,15,Kyle,"So how do we get to Ottawa?
"
7,15,Wrestler,"Oh that's easy. You just have to follow the road.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Which road?!
"
7,15,Firefighter,"This is Canada. We only have one road. 
"
7,15,Priest,"Follow the only road.
"
7,15,Man,"Follow the only road.
"
7,15,Canadians,"To go anywhere in Canada, you just follow the only road.
There's only one road in Canada. We call it the Road, the only road.
Hip-hip, hooray, let's hear it for our Road.
"
7,15,Road Workers,"And it's paved and wide and up to code.
"
7,15,Stan,"All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Word!
"
7,15,Canadians,"You're off to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!
"
7,15,Doctor,"Good-bye, friends! Good luck with the new Prime Minister! And remember to watch out for Scott! He's a dick!
"
7,15,Canadians,"Good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. 
"
7,15,Mountie,"Ahoy there, travelers.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
7,15,Mountie,"I am Rick, the proud Canadian Mountie. 
"
7,15,Sheep,"Baaaah.
"
7,15,Stan,"I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
"
7,15,Rick,"Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride...
"
7,15,Sheep,"Baaaah.
"
7,15,Cartman,"But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
"
7,15,Rick,"You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you.
"
7,15,Kyle,"That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
"
7,15,Rick,"Follow me this way! We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!
"
7,15,Scott,"Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!
"
7,15,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
"
7,15,Rick,"All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada.
"
7,15,Kyle,"French Canada?
"
7,15,French Canadians,"There'z no Canada like French Canada, it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.
Ze ozer Canada is hardly Canada. If you lived here for a day, you'd understand.
"
7,15,Mime,"Honh honh honnnh! Welcome to French Canada.
"
7,15,Hockey Player,"We have everyzing your heart could desire. Trapezes. Trampolines. And lots and lots of cheese.
"
7,15,Artist,"Would you like a moustache?
"
7,15,Rick,"Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd. 
"
7,15,Stan,"Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
"
7,15,Mime,"Well first you must answer that phone.  Ring-ring. Ring-ring.
"
7,15,Kyle,"We don't have time for this.
"
7,15,Mime,"You cannot pass through French Canada unless you take zat phone call!  Ring-ring. Ring-ring. 
"
7,15,Kyle,"Hello?
"
7,15,Mime,"Allo. If you are going to see za new Prime Minister, then I want to go with you. He has passed a new law forbidding us French Canadians to drink wine.
"
7,15,Artist,"How can ze French not drink wine?? Travestie!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Okay, you can come with us.
"
7,15,Mime,"Honh honnnh! Very good! Let us make haste!
"
7,15,French Canadians,"There'z no Canada like French Canada, it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.
And ze ozer Canada.
"
7,15,Mime,"Is a bullshit Canada
"
7,15,French Canadians,"If you lived here for a day, you'd understand. 
"
7,15,Mime,"I think you'd understand. ...You understand.
"
7,15,Rick,"Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place!
"
7,15,Mime,"It reminds me of death and fear.
"
7,15,Cartman,"How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
"
7,15,Rick,"We must be very close now.
"
7,15,Scott,"Ey! What are you doing?!
"
7,15,Rick,"Waaaah!
"
7,15,Mime,"Oh no. It's Scott.
"
7,15,Scott,"What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!
"
7,15,Rick,"You're a dick, Scott!
"
7,15,Scott,"You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you!
"
7,15,Fisherman,"Not so fast, Scott!
"
7,15,Scott,"Who the hell are you?!
"
7,15,Fisherman,"I'm Steve the Newfoudlander. And you're on Newfoundland property now! Get off before I have you arrested!
"
7,15,Scott,"Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!! 
"
7,15,Rick,"Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie!
"
7,15,Kyle,"God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
"
7,15,Steve,"Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh? He sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland. Life just hasn't been the same since he made sodomy illegal.
"
7,15,Mime,"Well, come with us! Maybe you can ask him to take his sodomy ban away.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Can we just get going, please?
"
7,15,Steve,"Yeah, sure, except there's just one problem.
"
7,15,Stan,"What?
"
7,15,Steve,"You folks are goin' the wrong way.
"
7,15,Stan,"What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
"
7,15,Steve,"Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction on it.
"
7,15,Rick,"Ohh, that's right. Ottawa is that way. 
"
7,15,Mime,"Of course. Ottawa left, Newfoundland right!
"
7,15,Stan,"Oh no!
"
7,15,Cartman,"How could you be so stupid!
"
7,15,Kyle,"There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
"
7,15,Rick,"It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there!
"
7,15,Mime,"Ah yes, let's wish ourselves there. 
"
7,15,Rick,"Is it working?
"
7,15,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! 
"
7,15,Steve,"Of course, we could always take my boat, eh?
"
7,15,Rick,"Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Well come on! 
"
7,15,Steve,"Okay, next stop, the new Prime Minister. 
"
7,15,Kyle,"Do you think we can still make it in time?
"
7,15,Cartman,"We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.
"
7,15,Steve,"Here we are at the Parliament buildin'.
"
7,15,Mime,"Ze Prime Minister is inside.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! 
"
7,15,Doorman,"Yes?
"
7,15,Kyle,"We need to see the new Prime Minister.
"
7,15,Doorman,"Ha! Impossible! The new Prime Minister isn't seeing anybody! 
"
7,15,Mime,"Oh well, zo much for zat. 
"
7,15,Steve,"Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best wasn't good enough, eh? 
"
7,15,Kyle,"No. No!! 
"
7,15,Doorman,"Yes?
"
7,15,Kyle,"Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
"
7,15,Doorman,"The Prime Minister isn't here. He's in China on official business. So you might as well go home. Good-bye!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 
"
7,15,Cartman,"And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. 
"
7,15,Stan,"And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. 
"
7,15,Kenny,"(And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...) 
"
7,15,Doorman,"Oh please! Please stop crying.
"
7,15,Cartman,"I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.
"
7,15,Doorman,"All right all right, I was lying. The Prime Minister IS here.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Really? 
"
7,15,Doorman,"Yes yes. Come in. 
"
7,15,Prime Minister,"I am the Prime Minister of Canada. What do you guys want?
"
7,15,Kyle,"Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-
"
7,15,Scott,"Not so fast! 
"
7,15,Kyle,"Ike!
"
7,15,Ike,"Kyle!
"
7,15,Scott,"Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. 
"
7,15,Prime Minister,"That is a great speech, guy. But the answer is no! All of my new laws will stay in effect forever!
"
7,15,Scott,"Haha, you lose, Americans!
"
7,15,Rick,"Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses.
"
7,15,Mime,"And we won't get our wine.
"
7,15,Steve,"And we can't perform sodomy, eh?
"
7,15,Kyle,"But why are you making such strange laws??
"
7,15,Prime Minister,"I SAID GO! 
"
7,15,Kenny,"(Gah!)
"
7,15,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
7,15,Kyle,"You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!
"
7,15,Prime Minister,"I am the Prime Minister of Canada.  I can do whatever I-  Uh oh. Uh, don't mind that guy hiding in the spider hole, he's just my friend.
"
7,15,Kyle,"What the hell??
"
7,15,Rick,"Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein!
"
7,15,Saddam Hussein,"Saddam Hussein?? Naw, relax, baby. I'm not him.
"
7,15,Mime,"Zat explains everything! Za new Prime Minister was Saddam Hussein, once again trying to take over our beloved Canada like he did before.
"
7,15,Soldier 1,"Saddam Hussein?
"
7,15,Soldier 2,"He was fooling us?
"
7,15,Businessman,"Get him! 
"
7,15,Saddam Hussein,"Ahh, don't shoot. I want to negotiate. Hey, relax!  Gah!
"
7,15,Rick,"Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back!
"
7,15,Mime,"And we can drink our wine.
"
7,15,Steve,"And I can sodomize me boys again
"
7,15,Harry,"Young man, you... must really care for Peter to have come all this way.
"
7,15,Elise,"Perhaps we were wrong to try and take Peter back. He doesn't belong here. He belongs with his family.
"
7,15,Harry,"Peter, would you like to go back to your home in Colorado? 
"
7,15,Stan,"What is that?
"
7,15,Cartman,"It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents!  And what did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! 
"
7,15,Kyle,"Dude, come on.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!
"
7,15,Rick,"Hey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!
"
7,15,Canadians,"Ding dong, they caught Saddam! Merry Christmas to the world!
Ding dong, the Americans caught Saddam!
Now Canada is free for you and you and me
It's the best Christmas presents we ever got
Canadian Christmas, it's the best! We drink and dance and show our breasts!
Let's celebrate! Saddam Hussein's been caught!
"
7,15,Stan,"Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. 
"
