13,1,Cartman,"Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
"
13,1,Stan,"I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Yeah, it's just so astounding.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend.
"
13,1,Craig,"Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend.
"
13,1,Kyle,"This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
"
13,1,Jimmy,"Well, so, w-who is she?
"
13,1,Cartman,"Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
"
13,1,Butters,"Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
"
13,1,Stan,"What?
"
13,1,Butters,"Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!
"
13,1,Stan,"Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
"
13,1,Butters,"Um, does Kenny like her?
"
13,1,Kyle,"I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
"
13,1,Butters,"Oh, no. Oh, geez!
"
13,1,Cartman,"Butters, what's the problem?
"
13,1,Butters,"Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
"
13,1,Kyle,"What?!
"
13,1,Butters,"It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
"
13,1,Cartman,"That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
"
13,1,Jimmy,"Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me.
"
13,1,Stan,"All right, come on, guys. 
"
13,1,Butters,"Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?
"
13,1,Girl 1,"So, anyway, I passed him a note, but then Johnny... 
"
13,1,Stan,"Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! 
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Oh, hi, guys.)
"
13,1,Stan,"Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(What about her?)
"
13,1,Stan,"Oh, boy.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
"
13,1,Kenny,"(But what?)
"
13,1,Kyle,"W-well, we've heard that she's...
"
13,1,Cartman,"Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Huh?)
"
13,1,Cartman,"Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!) 
"
13,1,Cartman,"He took it pretty well.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Hey, Tammy!)
"
13,1,Tammy,"Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)
"
13,1,Tammy,"TGI Friday's?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yep. I like the food!)
"
13,1,Tammy,"Yeah, okay. But...  Kenny. Listen. Uh, there's somethin' I need to talk to you about. There's a lot of rumors goin' around about me, that I agreed to give a boy a B.J.? Well, it's true.  But it was before you and I were together, and it wasn't my fault!  See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Jonas Brothers?)
"
13,1,Tammy,"You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control.  And then Dave Darsky showed up and took me to TGI Friday's,  and it just happened. But it was only for one second, and I had my eyes closed. I know it's terrible. Can you... can you forgive me, Ken? 
"
13,1,Clerk,"There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Thanks.) 
"
13,1,Cartman,"The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? 
"
13,1,Kyle,"Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)
"
13,1,Stan,"A B.J.?
"
13,1,Kyle,"You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Of course, dude!)
"
13,1,Cartman,"Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
"
13,1,Stan,"Yeah, dude, that's gross.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
"
13,1,Kyle,"What kind of protection?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)
"
13,1,Clerk 2,"Box of condoms. Certainly, little boy. What kind would you like?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)
"
13,1,Clerk 2,"These here? Why, certainly. 
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Cool!) 
"
13,1,Kyle,"Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)
"
13,1,Cartman,"Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yep! Woo-hoo!) 
"
13,1,Tammy,"Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome? 
"
13,1,Joe Jonas,"I'm ready to get it on.
But there's no gettin' on until I'm ready.
Too soon, slow down.
Take it easy, oh, my girl, I need your love. Bay-bay!
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"I can't wait till the day I kiss you.
Until then I have to tease you.
'Cause my mom doesn't like it when I'm naughty.
She'll make me clean my room if I'm naughty.
"
13,1,Joe,"Bay-bay! I'm hot.
"
13,1,Nick Jonas,"He's hot.
"
13,1,Little Girl,"My 'giney tickles! 
"
13,1,Tammy,"Oh, my God. It's that tingling again.  I love you! 
"
13,1,Joe,"Tell me how was I to know?
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"You'd take your love and go.
"
13,1,Joe,"Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"To put my arm around you?
"
13,1,Joe,"The seasons change.
"
13,1,Kevin Jonas,"Bay-bay!
"
13,1,Joe,"And the world goes round.
"
13,1,Nick,"The world goes round and round and round.
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take my time.
Can't wait 'til you are mine, but it might be a while. 'Cause,
yeah yeah, girl, we can take it slow, so we have room to grow.
And then someday we can get it on.
Until then, go back to Montreal.
"
13,1,Joe,"'Cause I still love you, bay-bay!
"
13,1,Nick,"Love you, bay-bay!
"
13,1,Kevin,"Bay-bay!
"
13,1,Tammy,"Whoooooo!  Aaah-oww!  You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe!
"
13,1,The Jonas Brothers,"Good night, Denver. We love you all!  We love you, Denver!  Good night! 
"
13,1,Tammy,"Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) 
"
13,1,Usher,"And, uh, you too, little girl in the red.
"
13,1,Tammy,"Huh?
"
13,1,Usher,"Band would like you to come backstage. You, too, little girl in the puppy T-shirt. 
"
13,1,Tammy,"They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Look, they're nothing, but...)
"
13,1,Tammy,"It's a dream come true! 
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Hey!)
"
13,1,Usher,"All right, right this way, girls.
"
13,1,Roadie,"Yeah, come on in everyone. The band is waiting for you.  Uh, not you. 
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)
"
13,1,Roadie 2,"The Jonas Brothers will be right out, girls. 
"
13,1,Girl in Puppy T-shirt,"Why do you think they called us back here?
"
13,1,Fat Girl,"They must've wanna have sex with us.
"
13,1,Tammy,"What? You think so?
"
13,1,Fat Girl,"Sure, they're a band. They called us back here so we can give them blowjobs.
"
13,1,Girl in Puppy T-shirt,"Well, I'm not doing it! Just 'cause they're rock stars doesn't mean I'll do that!
"
13,1,Girl in O T-shirt,"Yeah, I'm not giving a blowjob to anybody!
"
13,1,Tammy,"Me neither. 
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"Hey, there, girls! 
"
13,1,Joe,"Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience.
"
13,1,Nick,"Yeah, you were getting a little crazy out there.
"
13,1,Fat Girl,"Let's just get to the blowjobs.
"
13,1,Joe,"Blow what?
"
13,1,Kevin,"I don't know.  Look, we called you back here because we want to share our love of Christ with you
"
13,1,Nick,"And see if you'll wear purity rings from now on.
"
13,1,Tammy,"Purity rings?
"
13,1,Joe,"We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.
"
13,1,Kevin,"And it means we stay away from bad stuff and avoid people who swear and watch naughty TV shows.
"
13,1,Nick,"That's just how we roll.
"
13,1,Kevin,"Yeah.
"
13,1,Nick,"Yeah. 
"
13,1,Joe,"So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?
"
13,1,The Girls,"Okay.
"
13,1,Kevin,"And be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.
"
13,1,Stan,"So how did it go last night? 
"
13,1,Kyle,"What's that?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(A purity ring.)
"
13,1,Cartman,"Purity ring?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)
"
13,1,Kyle,"...Well, what does that mean?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
"
13,1,Stan,"Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-
"
13,1,Kenny,"(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
"
13,1,Kyle,"Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) 
"
13,1,Butters,"Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
"
13,1,Butters,"Uh, what's that?
"
13,1,Stan,"They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
"
13,1,Butters,"Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
Can't just do whatever I feel like, I've got to stay right, just and true.
I can't hang out with my buddies and get into trouble, 
'Cause now we're both wearing these rings for each other.
But who needs sex and drugs and partying 
When we can cook a meal, then sit around and watch Netflix...
Bay-bay!
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me that I must behave.
No need to chase after girls; it's a promise I can never break.
I made a commitment and it is forever, 
So we can spend every waking minute together.
And if we get bored it won't be a problem, 
'Cause we can just hang out with other couples who wear these rings...
Bay-bay!
"
13,1,Purity Boy 1,"Yeah, we found out that once you wear purity rings, it's best to hang out with other couples that do. Got more in common. Isn't that right, Sarah?
"
13,1,Purity Boy 2,"You know? What Carole and I enjoy is Grey's Anatomy. We love Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Carole?
"
13,1,Purity Boy 3,"We adore Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Nancy?
"
13,1,Nancy,"Adore it. Kenny and Tammy, do you watch Grey's Anatomy?
"
13,1,Purity Boy 1,"We look forward to it all week long. 
"
13,1,Purity Boy 3,"Sure is sweet.
"
13,1,Purity Boy 1,"It's the most fun I've had in weeks. 
"
13,1,Jonas Brothers,"I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
What I cannot do.
Bay... bay...
Baaay...
Baybay.
Baybay.
Baaaybaaaaay.
"
13,1,Director,"Aaand cut. Great video shoot, guys.
"
13,1,Joe,"This is bullpucky!
"
13,1,Kevin,"Yeah, we've had it, Goshdarnit!
"
13,1,Director,"Uh oh, looks like we've got a problem.
"
13,1,Joe,"Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!
"
13,1,Kevin,"Yeah, you tell 'em, Joe.
"
13,1,Disney Exec 1,"Boys, I know you're tired, but the purity rings are important to the company's image.
"
13,1,Joe,"We don't care about the company.
"
13,1,Director,"And you're gonna say that to the boss's face?
"
13,1,Kevin,"We aren', we aren't afraid of him.
"
13,1,Disney Exec 2,"Well, I hope you're right, because the boss is on his way here. Now.
"
13,1,Disney Exec 3,"Oh Jesus, he's here. The boss is here!
"
13,1,Kevin,"Let's be strong, guys.
"
13,1,Disney Exec 3,"Hello sir. How was your trip? 
"
13,1,Mickey,"What's all this I'm hearing about not wearing the purity rings, haha?
"
13,1,Director,"Uh we'll just leave you alone. 
"
13,1,Mickey,"So uh, I guess we have some issues, haha?
"
13,1,Kevin,"We... need to talk about something.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Oh boy! I just love flying all the way to Colorado to hear about your problems, haha.
"
13,1,Joe,"Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Oh Gosh, fellas, let me explain this to you one more time. You have to wear the purity rings because that's how we can sell sex to little girls, haha. See, if we make the posters with little girls reaching for your junk, then you have to wear purity rings or else Disney Company looks baaad, haha.
"
13,1,Joe,"Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.
"
13,1,Mickey,"The rings stay on!
"
13,1,Joe,"Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage. 
"
13,1,Mickey,"You don't... Fucking..Talk to me. Like that, haha. You little... piece of... shit, Haha!  Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up! Haha.  Now, do we have a problem?! Haha.
"
13,1,Nick,"No, sir.
"
13,1,Kevin,"No, Mr. Mouse.
"
13,1,Joe,"No, Mr. Mouse.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Oh, that's good, 'cause I thought we had a problem for a minute there, haha.  Alright now, get out there and make me some Goddamned money! Haha. 
"
13,1,Kyle,"Yup, he's in here. 
"
13,1,Stan,"Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
"
13,1,Kyle,"We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Look at this. More DVDs.) 
"
13,1,Cartman,"Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
"
13,1,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
"
13,1,Stan,"You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)
"
13,1,Stan,"You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
"
13,1,Kyle,"It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!
"
13,1,Stan,"What? 
"
13,1,Cartman,"""Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings."" These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! 
"
13,1,Kyle,"Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
"
13,1,Stan,"All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 
"
13,1,Kyle,"Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah...)
"
13,1,Announcer,"Live from Five News Studio in Colorado, it's Good Mornin' Denver.
"
13,1,Host,"We are joined this morning by the Disney supergroup the Jonas Brothers. Hello boys. 
"
13,1,Joe,"Hello.
"
13,1,Host,"Now, tell us what you're doin' here in Denver, guys.
"
13,1,Joe,"Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel.
"
13,1,Mickey,"In 3-D. Don't forget to mention in 3-D.
"
13,1,Kevin,"Oh, oh-and it's gonna be in 3-D. 
"
13,1,Host,"Now, guys, a lot has been made about your ""purity rings"". Can you tell us about those?
"
13,1,Joe,"Well. Um.  We, we wear these to symbolize how pure we are and how we ...um don't approve of things that are naughty or filthy.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Yeah, that's good. Get a close-up on their purity rings. Close-up on the purity rings, haha. 
"
13,1,Host,"That's wonderful, boys.  It's good that little girls can see a concert and not have it be about sex. We understand that at the concert tonight you'll be dousing girls in the audience with white foam. Is that correct?
"
13,1,Nick,"Uh huh.
"
13,1,Joe,"Yeah. Uh huh.
"
13,1,Kevin,"Yeah.
"
13,1,Nick,"Yeah.
"
13,1,Host,"Well can you give our audience a peek?  What do you say girls? Do you want the Jonas Brothers to douse you with their white foam? 
"
13,1,Mickey,"Oh boy! This is TV gold, haha. 
"
13,1,Stan,"Excuse us. Excuse us.
"
13,1,Girl 2,"Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
"
13,1,Host,"That's great stuff, boys. You like takin' the Jonas Brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?
"
13,1,Cartman,"Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
"
13,1,Stan,"Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
"
13,1,Joe,"Huh?
"
13,1,Kyle,"What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
"
13,1,Mickey,"Who the hell are these guys?  Are they from DreamWorks? Goddamn Eisner trying to hurt this company again, haha?
"
13,1,Cartman,"This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh 
"
13,1,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
13,1,Mickey,"You aren't ruining my plans this time, DreamWorks, haha! 
"
13,1,Stan,"Dude, who the hell did that?  Hwa? 
"
13,1,Kyle,"Dow... 
"
13,1,Voice 1,"Fifteen minutes, that's fifteen minutes, people!
"
13,1,Voice 2,"Get another mic on that dronk kid.
"
13,1,Mickey,"They almost ruined everything, haha. How did something like this happen, haha?  Wake up. Wake up, you little prick! Haha.  Who do you work for? DreamWorks?  Answer me, haha!
"
13,1,Stan,"We... don't work for any-body.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Oh boy, I sure believe that, haha.  You just tried to ruin Disney Company's big night for your own amusement, huh?! Haha.
"
13,1,Cartman,"The hell did you do to us?!
"
13,1,Mickey,"SHUT UP!  Haha.
"
13,1,Announcer,"And now, Disney Channel presents... the Jonas Brothers 3-D concert spectacular!  Live from Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado! 
"
13,1,Male Host,"Truly a night of magic as we're set for the biggest concert event of the year!
"
13,1,Female Host,"In about ten minutes, the Jonas Brothers are going to take the stage in what Disney is calling ""the most pure and innocent rock event of the millennia.""
"
13,1,Blonde Girl,"Do we put the 3-D glasses on now, da-da?
"
13,1,Father,"Not yet, Katie.
"
13,1,Male Host,"Everyone around the country is tuning in to see Disney's latest kid pop stars.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(And not getting a blowjob...)
"
13,1,Male Host,"We understand the Jonas Brothers are getting ready. What's going on backstage must be exciting.
"
13,1,Mickey,"You'd better start talkin', haha!  You'd better start talkin' right now, haha!
"
13,1,Stan,"We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
"
13,1,Kyle,"We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
"
13,1,Mickey,"You're lying! I'll cut you up, haha!
"
13,1,Joe,"You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.
"
13,1,Kevin,"We've all angered God.
"
13,1,Mickey,"You think God is in control here, haha?! I am in control! I've been in control since the '50s in case you haven't noticed, haha!  You three faggots are going onstage, and  YOU three faggots aren't going to stop me! NOBODY IS RUINING THIS EVENT!! Haha. I've worked too long and too hard to have anybody  fuck this up!  Where would you be without me, Jonas Brothers? Haha. Your music sucks and you know it! Haha. It's because you make little girls' 'ginies tickle! And when little girls' 'ginies tickle, I make money! Haha. And that's because little girls are fucking stupid! Haha. And the purity rings make it okay to do whatever I want! Haha. Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters! I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now, haha! And do you know why?!  Because Christians are retard-ed! Haha.  They believe in a talking dead guy! Haha.  Ohhh. Haha. Hello, folks.
"
13,1,Audience,"BOOO!!
"
13,1,Mickey,"Now now, take it easy, haha. Here's the Jonas Brothers.
"
13,1,Joe,"Come on guys. 
"
13,1,Mickey,"No! Stop! Bring them back here!
"
13,1,Roadie,"It's over, Mr. Mouse. Everyone's tuning out.
"
13,1,Mickey,"NO! NO GODDAMNIT! NO! SHUT UP! SHUT! UP! AAAAAAGH! 
"
13,1,Father,"That's it girls. No more Disney TV for a while.
"
13,1,Reporter,"Tom, the Disney Jonas Brothers 3D Television Special has failed, costing the Disney Company millions, and once again Mickey is pissed off and throwing a fit.
"
13,1,Mickey,"Vengeance is mine! You are all ants and I am your destroyer, haha.
"
13,1,Reporter,"The Disney purity ring venture will now most likely prove a marketing bust, as Mickey returns to Valhalla to slumber and feed. 
"
13,1,Tammy,"Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)
"
13,1,Tammy,"No! I don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy, Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)
"
13,1,Tammy,"Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah. Screw this crap!) 
"
13,1,Tammy,"Oh I feel better already!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Me too!)
"
13,1,Tammy,"What say you and me... go to T.G.I. Fridays?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Woo-hoo!!) 
"
13,1,Father Maxi,"And so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection. This young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee... For the world of oral sex is a world...
"
13,1,Cartman,"I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Well, now we know.
"
13,1,Cartman,"And knowing is half the battle.
"
13,2,Cartman,"The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. 
"
13,2,Josh,"Lisa I had a really great time tonight.
"
13,2,Lisa,"I did too, Josh.
"
13,2,Josh,"Would you... mind very much if kissed you?
"
13,2,Lisa,"Not at all. 
"
13,2,The Coon,"A woman being raped. This is what our city has been reduced to. When the money goes, the raping starts. Women are helpless... without the Coon.
"
13,2,Lisa,"O-hoh, yes Josh. Yehehessss!
"
13,2,The Coon,"Let her go!
"
13,2,Josh,"'Scuse me?
"
13,2,The Coon,"You aren't raping anyone tonight!
"
13,2,Josh,"Oh, it's a talking squirrel.  Oh!
"
13,2,Lisa,"Ah!
"
13,2,Josh,"Oh! Ow! Wugh! Oh!
"
13,2,The Coon,"Get out of here! Get to safety! 
"
13,2,Josh,"Ugh! L-lisa! Call me! Oh! Ow!
"
13,2,The Coon,"Another woman saved from rape. But how many more rapists are out there?
"
13,2,Josh,"Oh that really stings.
"
13,2,Officer 1,"Here's that file on the Rodriguez case, detective.
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"Alright, things are pretty quiet out there, boys. Let's try to get caught up on some paperwork. Murphy I want you to- 
"
13,2,The Coon,"Don't let the city's peacefulness fool you, commissioner! It's too quiet.
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"Oh, not this kid again.
"
13,2,Officer 1,"Hey, you get out of here. Out.
"
13,2,The Coon,"There was another rapist in the park tonight.  It's no coincidence. It must be a rapist plot and at stinks to the top.
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"What?
"
13,2,The Coon,"I think the Mayor might be involved. It's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash.
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"Jesus Christ,  can we get a lock on that window?  Look kid, you need to stop- 
"
13,2,Officer 1,"He's gone.
"
13,2,The Coon,"No, I'm just over here now.  What do we know about the Mayor's sexual preferences?
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents!
"
13,2,Officer 1,"Jail's full, sir.
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"Whatever. Then we'll just put you in- 
"
13,2,The Coon,"Now I'm back over here.
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"Just get out of here before we-! 
"
13,2,The Coon,"I'm right here now. 
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"All right, stop it!
"
13,2,The Coon,"Yes, I have to go now.  But in the meantime I have something that might interest you.  Make sure all your men get a look at these, detective!
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"What's in here? 
"
13,2,Cartman,"Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.
"
13,2,Stan,"Who's the Coon?
"
13,2,Cartman,"I know, right?  ""Who is the Coon?"" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.
"
13,2,Kyle,"...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
"
13,2,Cartman,"You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!
"
13,2,Kyle,"...Dude, what?!
"
13,2,Cartman,"He's not a fag!
"
13,2,Kyle,"Why do you care?
"
13,2,Cartman,"Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term ""fag,"" Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?
"
13,2,Cartman,"And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... ""Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?"" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Sometimes it seems the more criminals I try to stop, the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars. The city is a dying whore. She calls out to me to save her. And I don't know if I can. But she is still my city.  And I cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are-  Who the hell is that?  Who the hell are you?
"
13,2,M,"I'm an angel keeping watch over the city at night. As violence and darkness take over the streets, I work to rid this city of crime. I'm the symbol this town needs.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Aw nonononono, I am the symbol this town needs!  Dude, seriously, you can't do that! Go home! I was, I was doing this first!
"
13,2,M,"Nuh uh.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Yeah huh! You heard of the Coon and now you're being a copycat. Is that your name? Copycat?
"
13,2,M,"I am Mysterion.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Mysterion? That's fucking retarded! You just gave yourself away, Craig! Only you would think of a name that dumb!
"
13,2,Mysterion,"I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Yeah? Well you cannot know my true identity either.
"
13,2,Mysterion,"I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Well you're wrong! I'm not Eric Cartman and he's not fat! Care to guess again?!
"
13,2,Mysterion,"I really don't care who you are.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Oh all right Kyle! Yeah, took me real long to figure it out! Only you, Kyle, would be a buzzkill, and try to steal my thunder! You don't care about stopping crime, you're just doing this... 'cause you hate me, Kyle!
"
13,2,Mysterion,"Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?
"
13,2,The Coon,"No, I'm no- I  I'm sayin' that... Goddammit Stan is that you? It is you, isn't it? Clyde? Clyde, you're not a superhero, I am!
"
13,2,Mysterion,"I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. 
"
13,2,The Coon,"NO! Dude, I'm seriously! You're being a copycat! I'll sue you!  Motherfucker!
"
13,2,Cartman,"Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
"
13,2,The Coon,"How is it that nobody came to Coonicon 09? This is just, this is fucking ridiculous!
"
13,2,Maitre D,"Got everything you need here, sir? Okay on beverages, buffet items?
"
13,2,The Coon,"Yes, it's fine!
"
13,2,Maitre D,"Great. Hey, I just want to say that the Airport Hilton really appreciates your continued business.
"
13,2,The Coon,"What do you mean ""continued""? You don't know who I am!
"
13,2,Maitre D,"Aren't you that little boy who had his ginger pride rally and his AIDS benefit here, before?
"
13,2,The Coon,"No, I'm not that kid!
"
13,2,Maitre D,"Oh. Oh oh really? Oh my bad. I'm actually relieved. That kid was kind of a douchebag.
"
13,2,The Coon,"You're a fucking douchebag! Get outta here!
"
13,2,Cartman,"Hunh!
"
13,2,Liane,"Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?
"
13,2,Cartman,"I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
"
13,2,Liane,"Aww, what happened, hun?
"
13,2,Cartman,"I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
"
13,2,Anchor,"Tonight an incredible story of an unknown child in South Park who has taken to the streets in an effort to fight crime.
"
13,2,Cartman,"Wha, what?
"
13,2,Anchor,"But who exactly is... Mysterion? 
"
13,2,Cartman,"What?!
"
13,2,Anchor,"Curious crowds in the town of South Park, Colorado.  They've brought binoculars and camera phones trying to get a shot of a mysterious superhero.
"
13,2,Man 1,"Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak.
"
13,2,Woman 1,"He jumped down from the fire escape stairs, and then he just ran off. We barely got a look at him.
"
13,2,Man 2,"To me it looked like Mysterion to me. Everyone who's seen Mysterion, say yeah!
"
13,2,Crowd,"Yeah! 
"
13,2,Man 3,"Well I, I think he's kind of a symbol for the town, you know? A, a symbol.that everyone who's sick of crime can uh can rally behind.
"
13,2,Cartman,"Fuckin' butthole!
"
13,2,Man 4,"Well if you ask me, he's a menace. There's no room for vigilantism in today's world!
"
13,2,Reporter,"This artist rendition of Mysterion has already generated thousands of copies.
"
13,2,Cartman,"You gotta be kidding me!
"
13,2,Reporter,"As hundreds of people to try and get a glimpse of the superhero, one question remains: Who is Mysterion? 
"
13,2,Anchor,"If you have any idea about the true identity of Mysterion, please call the 9 News Hotline.
"
13,2,Cartman,"AAAAAHT!! 
"
13,2,Mysterion,"I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime.  I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe.  Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. 
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have?
"
13,2,Mysterion,"There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.
"
13,2,Officer 2,"We'll get right on it, Mysterion. Thank you. Thank you for all your help.  Godspeed, Mysterion!
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"You are a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak and dreary world! 
"
13,2,The Coon,"Dude, seriously? I'm gonna kick the shit out of you if you don't stop!
"
13,2,Mysterion,"This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-
"
13,2,"Mysterion, the Coon","Answer the call to save her.
"
13,2,The Coon,"That's what I'm supposed to say! I know it's you, Kyle. Just stop!
"
13,2,Mysterion,"I don't have time for this.  Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole!  Hey, he's got fireworks!
"
13,2,Cartman,"So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
"
13,2,Stan,"Not really.
"
13,2,Cartman,"Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! 
"
13,2,Stan,"Dude, what the hell?
"
13,2,Cartman,"Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!
"
13,2,Stan,"Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
"
13,2,Clyde,"Yeah, so do I.
"
13,2,Cartman,"What?! Why?
"
13,2,Clyde,"I don't know, it's just a cool costume.
"
13,2,Cartman,"It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
"
13,2,Wendy,"How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?
"
13,2,Cartman,"Fucking bitch...
"
13,2,The Coon,"I had no choice.  I was at the end of my rope.  Sometimes when a superhero needs answers, he has to turn to the wretched underbelly of society.
"
13,2,A Voice,"Hahahahahahahahaaa... Look what the cat dragged in.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Come out where I can see you!
"
13,2,A Voice,"What's the matter, Coon? Nervous?
"
13,2,The Coon,"I didn't want to resort to this, but he could have the answers I need.
"
13,2,A Voice,"How utterly delightful! The heroic and mighty Coon  come to put a stop to me again.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Chaos. I need to keep on my toes.  I'm not here to stop you this time, Chaos! I need information.
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Oh I'm sure you do. But you see I  whoop.  But you see I also know you like to beat me up.
"
13,2,The Coon,"I didn't call you to fight, Chaos! I came to see if you know Mysterion's identity. 
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Oh I'm close. And I'll put an end to him, and all of you goody-two-shoe heroes!
"
13,2,The Coon,"I'm not on his side!
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Do you think I'm a fool?! All those times you stopped me from my acts of evil! All those times you tricked me into meeting you, and then ga- and then gave me titty-twisters! Not this time, Coon! I finally learned my lesson! Now, General Disarray!  Yeah-ha! 
"
13,2,The Coon,"That's it! 
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"O- oh careful General Disarray.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Agh- Stop it! You, you... butthole! Knock it off!
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Hehyeah! We beat him, General Disarray! 
"
13,2,The Coon,"Listen to me! I want to... help you... get rid of Mysterion!
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Let him go, General Disarray!  Why would you help us?!
"
13,2,The Coon,"Because Mysterion is trying to  You fucker, that fuckin' hurt!  Because Mysterion is trying to say he's the hero this town needs! But that's my job!
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"But you both fight for justice and good.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Yeah, but he's a fuckin' dick! I want him gone just as much as you do!
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Very well. I will show you what we know about Mysterion's identity, but if this is some kind of setup-
"
13,2,The Coon,"N- I'm the good guy, Chaos. I don't betray people.
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Weh- oh yeah. 
"
13,2,The Coon,"I didn't like having to work with this scumbag. But I knew Mysterion was out there, plotting his next move.
"
13,2,Mysterion,"Hello Kyle.
"
13,2,Kyle,"Whoa, what the?
"
13,2,Mysterion,"Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.
"
13,2,Kyle,"Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.
"
13,2,Mysterion,"Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.
"
13,2,Kyle,"Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
"
13,2,Mysterion,"I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.
"
13,2,Kyle,"Who? Me? Why?
"
13,2,Mysterion,"Because I think you are the smartest kid in class. 
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"This way! We will now show you our secret headquarters of DOOM.
"
13,2,The Coon,"You guys have your own storage facility?
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Actually it belongs to General Disarray's grandma, um but she lets us use it.  This is where we come up with all our evil plans. Here's our computer relays.  And this is like a, a cube of chaos that can destroy the world in one second!  And here's some of our evil minions!  We have everything we need here. Can I offer you a Coke or a Sprite or something?
"
13,2,The Coon,"I'll take a Sprite.
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Uhget the Coon a Sprite, General Disarray.  As you can see we too have been working hard on Mysterion's identity.
"
13,2,The Coon,"You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...? Do you, do you still have that ""Who Is The Coon?"" T-shirt I gave you?
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Oh yeah, I think it's around here somewhere. Uh, using our photos we are tryin' to pinpoint Mysterion's identity.
"
13,2,The Coon,"Why is Cartman crossed out? He, he could be Mysterion.
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"No, he's too fat. Based on his body type it's gotta be someone like Stan or Kyle. 
"
13,2,The Coon,"Alright, al, alright, alright, look, Chaos. Just set up a video camera. I know how we can put an end to Mysterion once and for all.
"
13,2,Anchor,"The clock is ticking and the citizens of South Park are gripped in fear. Two days ago an evil unknown terrorist threatened major consequences if Mysterion  does not reveal his identity.
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Mark my words, South Park! Your precious hero is now, uh, your undoing! If Mysterion does not unmask himself publicly by Wednesday night, I am going to blow up... a hospital. Blow up a hospital?  I'm not gonna blow up any hospital. Are you nuts? What?  Uh, the choice is yours, Mysterion! Unmask yourself or hundreds will die! Hahaha.  Jesus Christ.
"
13,2,Anchor,"Since the threat was issued there has been no sign of Mysterion. Where is Mysterion?
"
13,2,Anchor 2,"Where is Mysterion?
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Hey Coon w-we aren't actually gonna blo- blow up anything, are we?
"
13,2,The Coon,"If you don't make good on your threats, Chaos, then what good are your threats?
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"But you really wanna blow up a hospital? I mean, a-aren't you a good guy?
"
13,2,The Coon,"Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos.
"
13,2,General Disarray,"You know, I've been thinking: if we're really evil villains, then we should betray him, and blow him up with the hospital.
"
13,2,The Coon,"You know, you're a little scrotum-licker dude! Why don't you shut the fuck up?!  Alright Chaos, I'm gonna get the triggers for these things at ACE Hardware. Keep an eye on this stuff! 
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Aww jeez General Disarray, this is a lot more than I ever really intended.  I mean, well I hate the world and all its beauty and happiness and all but, but blowin' up a hospital? It just seems mean.  Whoa. Oh hamburgers!
"
13,2,General Disarray,"AAAGH! 
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Aaah, a m m Mysterion, I b-, I beg you, I mean ah, judahadahada...
"
13,2,Mysterion,"Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Whowell I b- Well I b- ah I just would jes one nigh-, and then the Coon saw it up and I wa able to, and was able to 
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Waaugh!
"
13,2,Man 5,"What is that?
"
13,2,Man 6,"Look! Mysterion and Professor Chaos are fighting!
"
13,2,Man 7,"Give him hell, Mysterion! 
"
13,2,Woman 2,"Look out Mysterion! General Disarray is behind you! 
"
13,2,Officer 3,"Jesus Christ, we need backup out here! 
"
13,2,Officer 4,"I think I can get a shot at Chaos, sir.
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"You think your bullets can hurt him? 
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Yeah, we did it!
"
13,2,Man 8,"He's dead. Mysterion is dead.
"
13,2,Woman 3,"Nooo... 
"
13,2,Reporter,"The impossible has happened. Mysterion, beloved protector of the city, is dead. Who will save us now?
"
13,2,Man 9,"Wait! Look! 
"
13,2,Officer 4,"He's all right! 
"
13,2,Cartman,"Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
"
13,2,The Coon,"Fear not everyone! Coon is here to save the day.
"
13,2,Man 10,"Isn't that Bruce Vilanch?
"
13,2,Man 11,"Be careful Bruce Vilanch! There are superhumans fighting right over there!
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Okay sorry sorry! I'm sorry! I give up! Please, I give up!
"
13,2,The Coon,"Don't worry, Mysterion!  The Coon will now help you!
"
13,2,Professor Chaos,"Well, wait! I thought we were workin' together.  Waaa.  Oh jeez, I think I broke a tooth. 
"
13,2,The Coon,"That was great teamwork, Mysterion. South Park is safe. Until next time.
"
13,2,Mysterion,"What next time?
"
13,2,The Coon,"Well, people are obviously so desperate to learn your identity that they'll do anything. Won't be long before the next villain comes along and threatens violence unless you take off your mask. 
"
13,2,Mysterion,"Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself.
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante
"
13,2,The Coon,"Don't you think he knows that?! But superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good.
"
13,2,Man 12,"Don't show your face, Mysterion!
"
13,2,Man 13,"You have to be a symbol!
"
13,2,The Coon,"So that the next terrorist can threaten South Park if he doesn't unmask himself?!
"
13,2,Mysterion,"No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face. 
"
13,2,Crowd,"Ohhh.
"
13,2,Man 14,"Well I'll be.
"
13,2,The Coon,"I knew it was you! 'Member I even said it before!
"
13,2,Mr. Garrison,"Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion.
"
13,2,Sgt. Yates,"Well I'm sorry but you're under arrest. Take the kid to jail. 
"
13,2,The Coon,"My entire plan worked to perfection.  My work here is done.  With Mysterion out of the way the Coon can finally go back to keeping the city safe.  Once again, I alone am the symbol this town can stand behind.  Every town needs a hero.  Every town needs... a Coon. 
"
13,3,Stan,"Do I really have to do this, Dad?
"
13,3,Randy,"Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.
"
13,3,Stan,"But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
"
13,3,Teller,"Okay, next please.
"
13,3,Randy,"Go on, Stanley. 
"
13,3,Teller,"How can I help you, young man?
"
13,3,Stan,"I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
"
13,3,Teller,"Well that's fantastic, a really smart decision, young man. We can put that check in a Money Market Mutual Fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interest aaand it's gone. 
"
13,3,Stan,"Uh, what?
"
13,3,Teller,"It's gone. It's all gone.
"
13,3,Stan,"What's all gone?
"
13,3,Teller,"The money in your account - it didn't do too well, it's gone.
"
13,3,Stan,"What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.
"
13,3,Teller,"Not anymore you don't. POOF.
"
13,3,Stan,"Well, what can I do to get back my money-?
"
13,3,Teller,"I'm sorry sir, but this line is for bank members only.
"
13,3,Stan,"I just opened an account.
"
13,3,Teller,"Do you have any money invested in this bank?
"
13,3,Stan,"No, you just lost it all!
"
13,3,Teller,"Then please stand aside for people who actually have money with us. Next please. 
"
13,3,Stan,"Hey!
"
13,3,Teller,"Hello Mrs. Farnicle, how are you today? Making a deposit are we? Great, we can just put that into your retirement account and make it go to work for you aaaaand it's gone.
"
13,3,Elderly Woman,"What?
"
13,3,Teller,"Sorry, yeah, that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have money with the bank. Next please.
"
13,3,Stan,"Dad?!
"
13,3,Randy,"Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
"
13,3,Teller,"Oh, Mr. Marsh, don't worry. We can just transfer money from your account into a portfolio with your son aaand it's gone! This line is for people who have money with the bank only please step aside. 
"
13,3,Announcer,"This, is a 9 News Special Report. RECESSION: A NATION IN PERIL
"
13,3,Anchor,"An economic crisis has hit South Park and the nation like never before. Another South Park bank has closed down, leaving thousands of people in debt.
"
13,3,Mr. Garrison,"It's just crazy, you know? Ev-everyone's affected by it. It's like all the money just... vanished.
"
13,3,Stephen,"It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!
"
13,3,Butters,"Hi, Grandma!
"
13,3,Darryl Weathers,"First the money started goin', and now everyone's gettin' laid off work! They took arrr jawbs!
"
13,3,Worker 1,"They took our jobs!
"
13,3,Worker 2,"Trk rrr jrrbs!
"
13,3,Worker 3,"Tuck rjrrbs.
"
13,3,Worker 4,"Turk rjrrrbs.
"
13,3,Anchor,"Just how far will the economy fall? We asked economic reporter Dan Banks for his assessment.  We'll have the rest of Dan's interview tonight at 10.
"
13,3,Sharon,"All right everyone, eat up. 
"
13,3,Randy,"Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
"
13,3,Sharon,"You said we had to be very careful with our money. I've got nothing for our food budget.
"
13,3,Stan,"Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
"
13,3,Randy,"I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? 
"
13,3,Stan,"Yeah, I think I get it.
"
13,3,Orator 1,"And so why is our economy failing us? Because the government kept interest rates too low for too long! The government took our economy for granted and now we are all here paying the price! How long will we sit and watch our economy just-? As the people we must...
"
13,3,Orator 2,"...An angel came to me and so I say to you: Do not listen to the Wall Street brokers! For they are the ones that put us in this situation! Fat cats with corporate greed! They are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom! Our responsibility is...
"
13,3,Cartman,"And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
"
13,3,Randy,"There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!
"
13,3,Man 1,"He's right.
"
13,3,Man 2,"This is the first guy to actually make sense. 
"
13,3,Randy,"Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. 
"
13,3,Clerk,"Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?
"
13,3,Stan,"Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
"
13,3,Clerk,"Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh.  Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh.
"
13,3,Stan,"What?
"
13,3,Clerk,"I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?
"
13,3,Stan,"So?
"
13,3,Clerk,"Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.
"
13,3,Stan,"Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
"
13,3,Clerk,"Hm... that's improbahbluh,  but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. 
"
13,3,Randy,"We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!
"
13,3,Gerald,"What can we do, Randy?
"
13,3,Man 3,"Yes tell us.
"
13,3,Man 4,"Tell us.
"
13,3,Man 5,"Tell us what to do.
"
13,3,Man 6,"Tell us, Randy, what we should do!
"
13,3,Man 7,"What should we do, Randy?!
"
13,3,Randy,"We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. 
"
13,3,Al,"Mornin' Ted.
"
13,3,Ted,"Mornin' Al.
"
13,3,Kyle,"Well this sucks!
"
13,3,Clyde,"Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
"
13,3,Cartman,"Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!
"
13,3,Kyle,"You want something new every week, fatass.
"
13,3,Cartman,"Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!
"
13,3,Kyle,"My fault?
"
13,3,Cartman,"The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
"
13,3,Kyle,"Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!
"
13,3,Butters,"Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
"
13,3,Kyle,"Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
"
13,3,Butters,"Well Eric did. 
"
13,3,Cartman,"Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
"
13,3,Kyle,"Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family
"
13,3,Man 8,"We best speak with the Council, and tell them.. a young Jew is speaking heresy towards the Economy.
"
13,3,Receptionist,"Can I help you?
"
13,3,Stan,"I wanna return this Margaritaville.
"
13,3,Receptionist,"O-kay, let me send you into Josh. 
"
13,3,Josh,"Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?
"
13,3,Stan,"No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.
"
13,3,Josh,"Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah.
"
13,3,Stan,"What?
"
13,3,Josh,"Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm.
"
13,3,Stan,"Wall Street?
"
13,3,Josh,"Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah.
"
13,3,Stan,"So?
"
13,3,Josh,"Yeah, so the problem is your Margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big Margaritaville security, yeah, no. Yeah. No. Yeah... 
"
13,3,Stephen,"The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills.
"
13,3,Father Maxi,"You've really done an amazing thing, Mr. Marsh. People have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the Economy's mighty sword.
"
13,3,Randy,"I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.
"
13,3,Skeeter,"We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online.
"
13,3,Randy,"Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
"
13,3,Man 9,"Council, I bring news of discord! A young Jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the Economy!
"
13,3,Randy,"What?!
"
13,3,Man 9,"He was saying that... your ideas are false and the Economy is not vengeful. He was rallying people to spend more!
"
13,3,Father Maxi,"Spend more?! What mockery is this?!
"
13,3,Randy,"Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?
"
13,3,Cartman,"I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. 
"
13,3,Kyle,"What's that? 
"
13,3,Man 10,"'Scuse me, we need to borrow your squirrels.
"
13,3,Kyle,"What? 
"
13,3,Mr. Garrison,"Now please, please! 
"
13,3,Man 10,"You have sinned!
"
13,3,Mr. Garrison,"Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Please.
"
13,3,Kyle,"What's going on?
"
13,3,Man 10,"Garrison, you have brought your filth to this town for the last time!
"
13,3,Kyle,"What did he do?
"
13,3,Man 11,"Your teacher was caught buying a KitchenAid Stand Mixer at Bed Bath & Beyond!
"
13,3,Man 10,"Take that punishment, heathen! 
"
13,3,Kyle,"Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!
"
13,3,Man 10,"Move aside, kid! He must pay for his stand mixer.
"
13,3,Kyle,"Come on, this is ridiculous!
"
13,3,Man 10,"What's ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the Economy?!
"
13,3,Kyle,"Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. 
"
13,3,Mr. Garrison,"Oh. 
"
13,3,Stan,"'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?
"
13,3,Stockbroker,"Margaritaville?
"
13,3,Stan,"My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
"
13,3,Stockbroker,"Oh, that makes sense.
"
13,3,Stan,"It does?
"
13,3,Stockbroker,"You see, son, we lump thousands of these Margaritaville installment plans together into Margaritaville-based securities, then chop those securities up in a way that we could sell them to banks.
"
13,3,Stan,"So I can return it to a bank?
"
13,3,Stockbroker,"Nope, because a bunch of people like you are defaulting on their Margaritavilles so the government had to buy the Margaritavilles assets from the banks.
"
13,3,Stan,"What?!
"
13,3,Stockbroker,"Just talk to the Treasury Department in DC. They're the ones who really understand how all this works.  Oh, sell sell sell sell sell sell sell!
"
13,3,Stan,"Aargh! 
"
13,3,Kyle,"Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.
"
13,3,Man 11,"By all reports, the young Jew is not letting up! He is still going around convincing people to have faith in the Economy by shopping!
"
13,3,Randy,"We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?
"
13,3,Stephen,"Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us.
"
13,3,Father Maxi,"Are you retarded, Stotch?! The Economy is omnipotent! Which means it can do anything! So saying it would be limited to one Son is fucking stupid!
"
13,3,Randy,"That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!
"
13,3,Man 12,"Well then, there's only one option: we have to kill the Jew.
"
13,3,Father Maxi,"Yep, I think we gotta kill the Jew.
"
13,3,Skeeter,"I don't know... He's got a lot of support. It might be hard to even catch this Jew. 
"
13,3,Cartman,"Did somebody say ""catch a Jew""? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.
"
13,3,Treasurer 1,"Uhh, how can we help you, young man?
"
13,3,Stan,"I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
"
13,3,Treasurer 1,"Ohhh that makes sense.
"
13,3,Stan,"Nnnaaargh!
"
13,3,Treasurer 1,"No problem. We just need to consult the chart. We can determine your property's value and we'll be done.
"
13,3,Stan,"Really?  Thank you.
"
13,3,Treasurer 1,"Be right back. 
"
13,3,Treasurer 2,"Excellent news, sir. We've determined the investment value of your Margaritaville to be... ninety trillion dollars.
"
13,3,Stan,"What?!
"
13,3,Jimmy,"Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out.
"
13,3,Kyle,"I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
"
13,3,Butters,"Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
"
13,3,Kyle,"I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 
"
13,3,Cartman,"All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.
"
13,3,Kyle,"Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
"
13,3,Jimmy,"Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.
"
13,3,Kyle,"There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 
"
13,3,Stan,"Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
"
13,3,Treasurer 1,"What, you think it's worth more?
"
13,3,Stan,"No, dude, that doesn't make sense!
"
13,3,Treasurer 2,"Well, you don't get ninety trillion dollars, but the chart says that's what it's worth.
"
13,3,Treasurer 3,"Uh oh, problem! Problem again!
"
13,3,Treasurer 2,"What is it now?
"
13,3,Treasurer 3,"Another insurance company is about to go under; if they do, people could lose millions!
"
13,3,Treasurer 1,"Okay, no problem.  We'd better consult the chart. 
"
13,3,Treasurer 3,"Sirs, another insurance company is going under!
"
13,3,Sir 1,"Now determining most prudent move for insurance company. 
"
13,3,Treasurer 1,"Bailout!
"
13,3,Treasurer 3,"Most prudent move is a bailout!
"
13,3,Sir 1,"Bail out the insurance company! 
"
13,3,Man 13,"It's a miracle.
"
13,3,Man 14,"Why would someone do this? 
"
13,3,Randy,"What is this? What's going on?
"
13,3,Stephen,"There! Look!  It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.
"
13,3,Randy,"What's he doing?
"
13,3,Stephen,"He's... paying for everyone's debts. 
"
13,3,Darryl Weathers,"Hey thanks, kid, this is really nice of you.
"
13,3,Randy,"But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
"
13,3,Man 15,"So that people will have money to spend.
"
13,3,Sheila,"Kyle!  Kyle, you have to stop this! 
"
13,3,Kyle,"It's okay, Ma.
"
13,3,Sheila,"No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life!  Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! 
"
13,3,Randy,"Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
"
13,3,Kyle,"Heunh. 
"
13,3,Man 16,"He paid for our debts so we could spend once more. 
"
13,3,Man 17,"He's dead.
"
13,3,Dr. Doctor,"No, he's just passed out. We should get him to bed. 
"
13,3,Anchor,"For the first time in almost a year, the economy in South Park has taken a small, but noticeable upturn.  Stores and shopping malls are open again as newly debt-free people feel safe... to make purchases. 
"
13,3,Randy,"Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! ""Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom."" Oh, we need this! 
"
13,3,Anchor,"Are we out of the woods yet? Only time will tell. But we must not forget the sacrifice one person made to restore our faith and make us believe in the economy once again. The person we must thank every day for his amazing sacrifice.  Barack Obama. 
"
13,3,Kyle,"Aww, come on!
"
13,4,Cartman,"Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
"
13,4,Wendy,"Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?
"
13,4,Stan,"What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!
"
13,4,Wendy,"What day?
"
13,4,Butters,"The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
"
13,4,Clyde,"They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.
"
13,4,Red,"Oh God, that show is so dumb.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
"
13,4,Tweek,"Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!
"
13,4,Wendy,"Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!
"
13,4,Cartman,"No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. 
"
13,4,Little Girl,"Eww! 
"
13,4,Kyle,"Come on guys, we gotta go! 
"
13,4,Jimmy,"We're finally gonna learn the chocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Let's get to my house!! 
"
13,4,Wendy,"God they're so stupid!
"
13,4,Stan,"Oh boy!
"
13,4,Butters,"This is gonna be great!
"
13,4,Craig,"I've been waiting for this all week.
"
13,4,Butters,"Oh boy!
"
13,4,Cartman,"Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.
"
13,4,Craig,"Dude, I was here first.
"
13,4,Cartman,"It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! 
"
13,4,Butters,"Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!
"
13,4,Announcer,"You are watching the Canada Channel, the only channel in Canada.
"
13,4,Announcer 2,"Previously on Terrance & Phillip: Terrance farted on the American president, but Phillip took the heat. 
"
13,4,Phillip,"It wasn't me! 
"
13,4,Announcer 2,"And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Terrance & Phillip: Blood Rage 
"
13,4,Announcer,"...will not be seen tonight, so that we may bring you this Queef Sisters Special!
"
13,4,Cartman,"What?
"
13,4,Announcer 3,"The Canada Channel presents... The Queef Sisters. Katherine and Katie Queef.  Two Toronto girls who love shooting air out their vaginas.  It's The Queef Sisters special on Channel Canada.
"
13,4,Doctor,"Alright Queef Sisters, it's time for your yearly PAP smear and vag exam.
"
13,4,Katie,"Alright Doctor.
"
13,4,Katherine,"I'm ready, Doctor.
"
13,4,Doctor,"Now I'm just going to check for cysts.  Awww! 
"
13,4,Cartman,"What the fuck is this?!
"
13,4,Doctor,"Now listen heauh! If you queef in my face, then I refuse to be your gynecologist!
"
13,4,Katherine,"I'm sorry, doctor. I had air trapped in my vagina.
"
13,4,Katie,"Huhuhuhu!
"
13,4,Doctor,"Well just don't let it happen again! Now I'm going to check for cysts.  Arh!  Now stop it! That isn't funny! Babies come from there!  That's it! No PAP smear for you!
"
13,4,Katherine,"But doctor, what if I have cancer?
"
13,4,Doctor,"You should have thought of that before you queefed in my face three times! 
"
13,4,Butters,"They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
"
13,4,Katie,"Doctor, my sister is just being difficult. Maybe you can just examine my cervix instead.
"
13,4,Doctor,"Well alright, let me check for cysts.  Nooo!  That does it, Queef Sisters! I'm not your vaginal doctor anymore! 
"
13,4,Katherine,"Oh Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry.
"
13,4,Katie,"I guess so Katherine.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
"
13,4,Phillip,"What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
"
13,4,Terrance,"Queef Sisters?!
"
13,4,Network President,"That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out.
"
13,4,Terrance,"You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!
"
13,4,Phillip,"That's sick!
"
13,4,Network President,"You think farts are funny; why not queefs?
"
13,4,Terrance,"Because babies come from there!
"
13,4,Network President,"Eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! You know, women empowerment and the get-go. So we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale!
"
13,4,Cartman,"No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
"
13,4,Wendy,"What's going on?
"
13,4,Stan,"We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
"
13,4,Cartman,"You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
"
13,4,Clyde,"I threw up on my way home.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! 
"
13,4,Stan,"You tell 'em, Cartman!
"
13,4,Red,"What happened?
"
13,4,Butters,"They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
"
13,4,Kyle,"It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
"
13,4,Bebe,"Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
"
13,4,Cartman,"You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! 
"
13,4,Bebe,"I can't believe they're this upset.
"
13,4,Red,"God, they're annoying!
"
13,4,Annie,"I don't even know what a queef is.
"
13,4,Wendy,"It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.
"
13,4,Annie,"Oh.
"
13,4,Red,"You know that girl Samantha Dunskin, she can make herself queef whenever she wants.
"
13,4,Bebe,"Really?
"
13,4,Wendy,"Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
"
13,4,Cartman,"And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
"
13,4,Kyle,"Robbed us of our innocence.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Yes, that's good.
"
13,4,Butters,"Robbed us of our innocence... 
"
13,4,Wendy,"Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you.
"
13,4,Stan,"What? 
"
13,4,Butters,"Oh God, oh my God no! 
"
13,4,Stephen,"Butters?
"
13,4,Randy,"Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. 
"
13,4,Sharon,"Why? What happened?
"
13,4,Randy,"A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. 
"
13,4,Sharon,"...So?
"
13,4,Randy,"Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
"
13,4,Stan,"Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
"
13,4,Randy,"I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.
"
13,4,Stan,"It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
"
13,4,Randy,"Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.
"
13,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, parents, some of you have already heard, but most of you have not, m'kay? We've had a terrible incident occur at the school. Apparently a young girl uh, went up to a young boy here at the school, m'kay, and queefed in his face. 
"
13,4,Gerald,"How did this happen?
"
13,4,Stuart,"Where were the teachers?!
"
13,4,Mrs. Testaburger,"Whoa, whoa whoa, wait a minute. Are you saying we're all here just because a girl queefed on a boy?
"
13,4,Man,"Just?!
"
13,4,Thomas,"We're here to find out why?!
"
13,4,Randy,"The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! 
"
13,4,Principal Victoria,"Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. 
"
13,4,Randy,"What does that have to do with anything? 
"
13,4,Regis,"Our next guests have really taken America by storm. Their hit show is being tuned in by women all over the world. Please welcome the Queef Sisters! 
"
13,4,Katherine,"Oh hello Regis.
"
13,4,Katie,"Hello Kelly. 
"
13,4,Regis,"So, uh, gals, ...you seem to really like queefing.
"
13,4,Katherine,"Well Reeg, it's like this: we think that queefing is a perfectly normal female bodily function. Why not have fun with it? 
"
13,4,Regis,"But I mean really, isn't queefing a bit juvenile?
"
13,4,Katie,"Men enjoy farts, so why shouldn't women enjoy their queefs?
"
13,4,Katherine,"That's right. We've written all about it in our new feminist book, Eat, Pray, Queef.
"
13,4,Kelly,"Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you. 
"
13,4,Regis,"D'ohhh! 
"
13,4,Network President,"Terrance and Phillip, you've put on a terrific show for many many years. You've made Canada Channel what it is today. You're fired.
"
13,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Fired?!
"
13,4,Network President,"Sorry guys, but this queefing thing is really catching on.  Queef Sisters' ratings are through the roof, and to pay them what they're asking we've gotta get rid of you. Goodbye. Here's some cookies. 
"
13,4,Terrance,"Brian, don't do this!
"
13,4,Phillip,"You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!
"
13,4,Brian,"Yes, I know it's sick. To be honest, I gag every time one of them lets out a queef.  But it's money Goddammit and this channel needs it! I'm sorry, Terrance & Phillip, your show is done!
"
13,4,Martha,"I always love when Spring is on the way. Such a fun and inspiring time to decorate. Just like most women out there I've really gotten into queefing lately.  It's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays. What we're gonna do is just... cut out some paper... like... this...  and cut out little stars and little moon shapes,  and we're gonna just... jam those... up... and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores; they come in... little tube which make them very easy to just...  shoot... right up the ol'... there we are.. And of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive Easter grass. But the point is that when we're done we can... let one rip.  See how pretty that was? It's a good thing.
"
13,4,Randy,"What was that?
"
13,4,Sharon,"Oh, excuse me, I...  I, I had a little air trapped. 
"
13,4,Randy,"Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?
"
13,4,Sharon,"Pardon me. 
"
13,4,Stan,"Mom, gross! 
"
13,4,Randy,"Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
"
13,4,Sharon,"Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.
"
13,4,Randy,"Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!
"
13,4,Stan,"Stop it, Mom!
"
13,4,Randy,"Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?
"
13,4,Sharon,"Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
"
13,4,Randy,"Sharon! Marsh!
"
13,4,Sharon,"Ex-cuse me.
"
13,4,Shelly,"Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef. 
"
13,4,Randy,"That's it, I'm leaving! 
"
13,4,Stan,"I'm going too. 
"
13,4,Sharon,"Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!
"
13,4,Randy,"That's completely different!
"
13,4,Stan,"Yeah it's different, Mom!
"
13,4,Sharon,"Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.
"
13,4,Randy,"Heh, yeah?
"
13,4,Sharon,"But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.
"
13,4,Randy,"Yeah?
"
13,4,Sharon,"And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. 
"
13,4,Randy,"Come on Stanley, let's go. 
"
13,4,Sharon,"Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!
"
13,4,Randy,"It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! 
"
13,4,Katie,"Look Katherine, I made queef cookies!
"
13,4,Katherine,"But those are just ginger snaps, Katie.  Could you get that, Katie? 
"
13,4,Katie,"Oh my God! Look, Katherine! It's Canadian television stars Terrance & Phillip!
"
13,4,Katherine,"Oh my God, they're famous!  Well hello sirs! It is such an honor to meet you! Oh Katie, I'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy. 
"
13,4,Katie,"Wooo.
"
13,4,Phillip,"May we come in, please?
"
13,4,Katherine,"Oh certainly, though I feel we look a mess. 
"
13,4,Terrance,"Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.
"
13,4,Katie,"Oho yes, the show is going aboat as well as it could. 
"
13,4,Terrance,"All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!
"
13,4,Phillip,"That's right! We've come to kill you! 
"
13,4,Katie,"Why kill us? We love you.
"
13,4,Terrance,"Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!
"
13,4,Katherine,"Oh. Well I suppose if we're going to die, we should die by the hands of our idols.
"
13,4,Terrance,"Your idols?
"
13,4,Katherine,"We grew up watching you. You meant the world to us. We used to fantasize about pleasing you in all different ways. Know that it is an honor to die by your hand. 
"
13,4,Terrance,"I don't think I can do it, Phillip. 
"
13,4,Phillip,"Why not? 
"
13,4,Terrance,"Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.
"
13,4,Phillip,"What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. 
"
13,4,Butters,"Ohhhhh ohhhhh. 
"
13,4,Cartman,"Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
"
13,4,Butters,"Oh. Hey fellas.
"
13,4,Cartman,"We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
"
13,4,Butters,"Aw thanks.
"
13,4,Stan,"Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
"
13,4,Butters,"Ohhhhh ohhhhh!
"
13,4,Kyle,"Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
"
13,4,Butters,"My, my picture?
"
13,4,Cartman,"You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.
"
13,4,Terrance,"AAH! 
"
13,4,Phillip,"Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!
"
13,4,Terrance,"No, that was me, Phillip. I farted.
"
13,4,Phillip,"Oh. 
"
13,4,Katherine,"Oh, this is a dream come true. I've always wanted to meet you, Phillip. 
"
13,4,Terrance,"Phillip?! I'm Terrance!
"
13,4,Katie,"What? I thought you were Terrance.
"
13,4,Phillip,"No, I'm Phillip!
"
13,4,Katherine,"Oh dear. 
"
13,4,Stephen,"A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.
"
13,4,Stan,"On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
"
13,4,Randy,"I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker  And then there's The Foghorn  and the ""Don't be scared""  and of course there's the-
"
13,4,Woman,"Excuse me.  Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too.
"
13,4,Other Women,"That's right! We do.
"
13,4,Woman,"For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn.  and The Resuscitator 
"
13,4,Cartman,"Sick! Stop it, lady!
"
13,4,Randy,"Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! 
"
13,4,Woman 2,"That's all well and good, but we can do the Road Warrior. 
"
13,4,Road Warrior Queef,"Nooo! We go iiin! We kiiill! No more talk! We kiiill! Soon, my dog of war, but we have to do it my way.  Losers! Losers wait!
"
13,4,Males,"AWWW!
"
13,4,Randy,"Jesus Christ!
"
13,4,Phillip,"You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! 
"
13,4,Katherine,"I'm not your sex toy, you fucking pig! 
"
13,4,Phillip,"Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!
"
13,4,Katherine,"Fuck you, you don't fucking slap me! 
"
13,4,Terrance,"Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.
"
13,4,Phillip,"She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!
"
13,4,Terrance,"SICK!
"
13,4,Katie,"Well what's the big deal? I've been queefing in this bed the entire time.
"
13,4,Terrance,"What?! Gross! 
"
13,4,Katie,"How dare you?! 
"
13,4,Katherine,"Get out! Get out both of you!  We never want to see you again! 
"
13,4,Terrance,"After everything we've been through? 
"
13,4,Terrance,"What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes.
"
13,4,Phillip,"Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.
"
13,4,Terrance,"Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
"
13,4,Phillip,"Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.
"
13,4,Katie,"Oh Terrance. 
"
13,4,Katherine,"Phillip! 
"
13,4,Randy,"Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!
"
13,4,Stan,"No way! We did it?!  Yeah!!
"
13,4,Randy,"Alright son! Yeah!!
"
13,4,Sharon,"What's going on?
"
13,4,Randy,"HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!
"
13,4,Sharon,"Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.
"
13,4,Randy,"Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...
"
13,4,Sharon,"You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys.  For getting your way... again. 
"
13,4,Stan,"Mom, we didn't mean... 
"
13,4,Randy,"Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. 
"
13,4,Stan,"Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
"
13,4,Randy,"Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.
"
13,4,Randy,"There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
"
13,4,"Randy, Stan","And realize we've been keeping women down.
"
13,4,Mr. Mackey,"They have power and they have courage.
"
13,4,"Stephen, Butters","And we must all stand by the belief,
"
13,4,"Gerald, Kyle","That a woman is strong, and she has the right to queef.
"
13,4,The Males,"Fly free. Free to queef aloud; fly free. Let every queef show that you’re proud.
"
13,4,Randy,"You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
"
13,4,The Males,"You are woman now, and you are free to queef.
"
13,4,Cartman,"It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
"
13,4,Mr. Garrison,"They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.
"
13,4,The Males (Randy),"Queef free (Queef free). Every woman has the right; queef free (Queef free). Let your queefing stars shine bright.You are woman, hear you roar (queef free), queefing too loud to ignore. Queef a little each day and let your soul take flight!
Ah-aaaaaaah-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, queef free.
"
13,4,Bishop,"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.  Nooo! 
"
13,4,Phillip,"Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!
"
13,4,Bishop,"Therefore what God has joined together let no man- 
"
13,4,Phillip,"Aww. sick! 
"
13,4,Bishop,"That's it! I now pronounce you farts and queefs! 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy  ...rou-routine.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.
"
13,5,Cartman,"No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
"
13,5,Cartman,"No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"...So the Pope says, ""What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?""
"
13,5,Cartman,"Meh. 
"
13,5,Sarah,"Here's some fruit, boys.  Better for you than potato chips. Oh Jimmy, look out, there's a black widow! 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Yeah, I like fishsticks.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks.  Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before? 
"
13,5,Cartman,"What, dude, you got something?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"You like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.
"
13,5,Butters,"Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
"
13,5,Clyde,"Hey.
"
13,5,Stan,"What's going on?
"
13,5,Butters,"Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?
"
13,5,Clyde,"Yes. 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
"
13,5,Clyde,"Yes. 
"
13,5,Cartman,"What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?
"
13,5,Butters,"HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?
"
13,5,Token,"Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so. 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
"
13,5,Token,"Yes.
"
13,5,Cartman,"What are you?
"
13,5,"Butters, Cartman","A gay fish? 
"
13,5,Butters,"Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 
"
13,5,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, hey Mackey? Do you like fishsticks?
"
13,5,Mr. Mackey,"Fishsticks? Yeah, I l- I like fishsticks, m'kay?
"
13,5,Stephen,"Oh hey Peterson, buying fishsticks, I see.
"
13,5,Peterson,"Yeah, I like fishsticks.
"
13,5,Stephen,"What are you, Peterson? A gay fish? 
"
13,5,Announcer,"And now, here he is! Jimmy Kimmel! 
"
13,5,Jimmy Kimmel,"Alright, hey, how are we all feelin' tonight?  So uhhh, let me ask the guys in the audience a question. Do you like fishsticks?
"
13,5,The Guys,"Yes.
"
13,5,Jimmy Kimmel,"Huh. What are you, gay fish? 
"
13,5,David Letterman,"And so uhhh, hay Paul, do you like fishsticks, Paul?
"
13,5,Paul Shaffer,"Uhhh, sure?
"
13,5,David Letterman,"What are you, Paul, a gay fish? 
"
13,5,Jay Leno,"So apparently more and more Americans are eating fishsticks. Have you seen this? Have you read about this? Loving fishsticks, kinda makes me wonder, you know? What is everybody, a gay fish? 
"
13,5,Tom Snyder,"It is quite possibly the funniest joke over conceived, and its origin is unknown. The fishsticks joke crosses all border, all races, all ages and ethnic groups and is slowly uniting our country. In fact, the only person who appears to not get the joke is rapper Kanye West, who becomes furious when people use the joke on him.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Yo, that is messed up, yo! I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain't no fish! Alright?!
"
13,5,Tom Snyder,"You. Really. Don't. Get it.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Hey man, I'm a genius, alright?! I'm the most talented musician in the world! If I was a homosexual, or a fish, I would know!
"
13,5,Tom Snyder,"You're a rapper.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Yes.
"
13,5,Tom Snyder,"An entrepreneur.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Yes.
"
13,5,Tom Snyder,"And you like fishsdicks.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Yes.
"
13,5,Tom Snyder,"You're a gay fish.
"
13,5,Kanye,"No! I am not no gay fish!
"
13,5,Tom Snyder,"Just gay?
"
13,5,Kanye,"I'm not gay and I'm not a fish! Man!
"
13,5,Tom Snyder,"You are male?
"
13,5,Kanye,"Damn right I'm male.
"
13,5,Tom Snyder,"A male that like fish dicks.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Yeah, I like fishsticks
"
13,5,Tom Snyder,"You like to put fish dicks in your mouth.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Yeah.
"
13,5,Tom Snyder,"You're a gay fish.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Alright, that does it! I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass! 
"
13,5,Cartman,"And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
"
13,5,Kyle,"We know, Cartman!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"P-patent?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! 
"
13,5,Kyle,"Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh...
"
13,5,Kyle,"Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Actually it was potato chips.
"
13,5,Kyle,"I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room.
"
13,5,Craig,"Then just give him half.
"
13,5,Kyle,"What?
"
13,5,Craig,"I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.
"
13,5,Kyle,"Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
"
13,5,Craig,"Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.
"
13,5,Kyle,"No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say ""Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!""
"
13,5,Craig,"Just give him half.
"
13,5,Kanye,"There are a lot of people out there making up rumors about me that are malicious and untrue. But I'm going to prove once and for all: I'm not a fish. Because I am a genius, I've ascertained that fish have gills.  Doctor, do I have gills?
"
13,5,Doctor,"He does not have gills.
"
13,5,Kanye,"You hear that? No gills! So I can't be a fish. And I'm a genius voice of a generation so I'm not gay! So that is that! Alright?! It's over! Now are there any questions?
"
13,5,Reporter 1,"Do you like fishsticks?
"
13,5,Kanye,"Love 'em!
"
13,5,Reporter 2,"You're a gay fish. 
"
13,5,Kanye,"No I'm not- AAAARGH! 
"
13,5,Conan O'Brien,"Alright, recently... Recently we've all come to know the fishsticks joke as probably the funniest, most awesome joke ever, but who originally came up with it? Well here's your answer. Joining us tonight, the brains behind the incredible fishsticks joke, the one and only Carlos Mencia.
"
13,5,Carlos Mencia,"Yeheah, Vive la Mexico!
"
13,5,Conan O'Brien,"So Carlos, you've got a show on Comedy Central, a stand-up tour, where did you have time to come up with this classic joke?
"
13,5,Carlos Mencia,"Well you know I just kicking it with my homies and my brain, you know, my brain is always so full of ideas 'cause I'm so fonny and stuff, so I was just all like, """"Hey, Papito, you like fishsticks?"" And my homeboy says ""Yeah Carlos"" you know, ""you're so funny!"" And then it just occurred to me. I said, ""Oh man, you must be a gay fish, homes!""  And this is how I came up with it, my amigos! 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Motherfucker!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Really?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.
"
13,5,Cartman,"But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.
"
13,5,Cartman,"What?!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
"
13,5,Sarah,"Here's some fishsticks guys. I hope you like fishsticks.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Wow, thanks Eric.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Is that... Is that how it happened?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"I'm... I'm sorry?
"
13,5,Cartman,"It's cool man, it's cool. 
"
13,5,Announcer,"Here he is, y'all! Give it up for Kanye West!
"
13,5,Kanye,"Yo. Ungh. Yo.  Yo, whoa! Whoa, what the hell?! 
"
13,5,Audience,"Gay fish! Gay fish! Gay fish!
"
13,5,Kanye,"Yo, fuck this noise, yo! 
"
13,5,Kanye,"Just doesn't make any sense, yo. Why is everyone calling me a gay fish?
"
13,5,House,"Kanye, look, we all think it would be better if you would just drop it. Ya-you know, I mean, ih-if you don't get it, you don't get it.
"
13,5,Kanye,"What do you mean, I don't get it, House?! I'm a genius. I'll understand it, I just need to break it down is all. Now let's see...  Somethin' about fishsticks... interacting with me... makes me gay fish.
"
13,5,Aide 1,"Kanye, really...
"
13,5,Kanye,"Shut up!  Alright, now what do we know about fishsticks?  They're breaded, they're fried, they're frozen. Then under me we have rapper, genius. And gay fish are homosexual. They swim.  Is it because breaded has something to do with genius? Which swims?
"
13,5,House,"No, because you said you like fish dicks, Kanye! Don't, don't you get it? You see, fish dicks is a is a play on words.
"
13,5,Kanye,"I don't need anyone tellin' me ""play on words""! I'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
"
13,5,Kyle,"Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.
"
13,5,Cartman,"It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. 
"
13,5,Kyle,"You know what, Cartman? I believe you.
"
13,5,Cartman,"You do?
"
13,5,Kyle,"Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
"
13,5,Cartman,"But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.
"
13,5,Cartman,"That's cool. You wanna write some together? 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Hey, you're really onto something there.
"
13,5,Sarah,"Hello Eric. Have some chips, because you're totally not fat at all.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?""
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Right. And then I say, ""Yeah.""
"
13,5,Cartman,"So then I can say, ""What are you, a gay fish?""
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Oh wow, this is incredible! 
"
13,5,Sarah,"What is that?
"
13,5,Cartman,"It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! 
"
13,5,Butters,"Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.
"
13,5,Clyde,"He's the most awesome kid in school!
"
13,5,Wendy,"And he's not fat at all.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Thanks you guys!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable, and fishsticks are crunchy?
"
13,5,Aide 2,"Yo Kanye, KANYE! We found him money.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Found who?
"
13,5,Aide 2,"You told us to track down whoever started the whole fishstick thang. We found out who, dawg.
"
13,5,Carlos Mencia,"Come on, maaaan. What is this, maaaan? What the fuck is goin' on maaaan?  Oh fuck maaaan, Kanye Wehhst? Noo shiiit maaan, okay look it wasn't me. I didn't really start the fishstick thing, alriight?
"
13,5,Kanye,"You're just sayin' that now 'cause you're scared.
"
13,5,Mencia,"No man it's truuue. I stole it maaan. I took credit for it 'cause I'm not actually funneee. Come on, maaan, do you know what it's like? Being a comedian but not being funneee? Come on, Kanye, I just take jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent, maaan.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Think you can make fun of me? I'm a genius! I'm the voice of a generation! What are you?!
"
13,5,Mencia,"Nothing! Look at me maaan. I'm not funny, I steal jokes, my dick don't work maaan. I got to piss in a plastic bag, man, I got no dick.
"
13,5,Kanye,"I ain't gonna hurt you. I pay people to do that for me.
"
13,5,Mencia,"Awww shih oh no man, come on, I got no dick, man! 
"
13,5,Kanye,"Now, explain it to me. Why do people think I'm a gay fish?
"
13,5,Mencia,"'Cause... 'cause you like fish dicks, man. Come on, maaan. Don't you get it? Please, just get it, maaan.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Why- Look at me, look at me!  I love fishsticks. I love putting fishsticks in my mouth. 
"
13,5,Mencia,"You're a- ...you're a gay fish, maaan. 
"
13,5,Ellen DeGeneres,"Thank you, thank you very much. Well, about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke. And ever since then us comedians have been kicking ourselves for not thinking of it.  But today we have with us the true creators of the fishsticks joke. Please welcome the comedy team of Cartman and Valmer.  Hey guys!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.
"
13,5,Ellen,"So guys, I gotta ask: how did you come up with this incredible joke?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"It was just a-
"
13,5,Cartman,"Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
"
13,5,Ellen,"But guys, this joke is so... perfect. Can you explain how nobody thought of it before?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-
"
13,5,Cartman,"Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. 
"
13,5,Ellen,"That's so great. And, and are you crying, Jimmy?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Yes Ma'am. 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.
"
13,5,Ellen,"I see. And did you know that Carlos Mencia was found dead in his house this morning with fishsticks stuffed down his open neck hole? 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Uhhh excuse me? 
"
13,5,Kanye,"Get my jet ready. Looks like we got another inning to play. 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Yeah, that was kewl huh?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Eric, there's something I really need to know.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Whassat?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke.  But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!
"
13,5,Cartman,"So... here it is.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
"
13,5,Cartman,"That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!
"
13,5,Kanye,"Tie up these motherfuckers!  Now I'm gonna ask you motherfuckers one more time: why did you start these rumors about me?!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are.
"
13,5,Kanye,"Aw right. Everyone knows who I am! I wanna know how this got started!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-
"
13,5,Cartman,"Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-
"
13,5,Cartman,"Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Hello Jim.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!
"
13,5,Cartman,"What are you up to?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat. 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
"
13,5,Sarah,"Eric Cartman, you are handsome and not even remotely fat.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, ""Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?"" 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"What was that? 
"
13,5,Butters,"Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! 
"
13,5,Wendy,"You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There! 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"What?!
"
13,5,Cartman,"You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"What? I, I still don't get anything.
"
13,5,Cartman,"All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Rih, r-r-really?
"
13,5,Cartman,"I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding.
"
13,5,Kanye,"He's right. For so long I've considered myself God's gift to the world that I couldn't take it when people made fun of me. But they weren't makin' fun of me. They were tryin' to help me.  Boys I understand what you did now.  Untie them guys. I know what I have to do.
"
13,5,Aide 2,"Yo Kanye! You sure about this?
"
13,5,Kanye,"It's time for me to stop runnin'. I need to believe what people tell me.  Let all my fans know I love 'em, but a gay fish just can't live in the outside world forever. Don't be sad for me guys!  I'm goin' home! 
"
13,5,Kanye,"(Uh. Come on.)
I've been so lonely, girl, I've been so sad and down.
Couldn't understand why haters joked around
I wanted to be free with other creatures like me
And now I got my wish...
'Cuz I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (it's alright, girl)
Makin' love to other gay fish gay fish (Unh)
All those lonely nights at the grocery store
In the frozen fish aisle feeling like a whore
'Cuz I wasn't being true even though everyone said
That I had to make a switch (dead fish)...
Now I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a, I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (Yes, now where I belong, girl)
Making love to other gay fish.

13,6,Randy,"Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. 
"
13,6,Sharon,"Hey guys, it's almost 2 a.m.
"
13,6,Randy,"We know!
"
13,6,Sharon,"Well it's way past time for bed.
"
13,6,Randy,"Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!
"
13,6,Sharon,"Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.
"
13,6,Randy,"That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. 
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
"
13,6,Randy,"Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There.
"
13,6,Stan,"What is that?
"
13,6,Randy,"It's, uh it's nothing, really.
"
13,6,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the Hadron particle super-collider in Switzerland, where authorities are shocked and baffled over the theft of a superconducting bending magnet created for use in tests with particle acceleration.
"
13,6,Stan,"Oh no, he didn't.
"
13,6,Reporter,"The superconducting magnet was stolen sometime last week. Surveillance cameras were able to record the theft on tape and police are now looking for  Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. Caught here in these photos, the troubled rebel princess is seen taking the superconducting magnet and then appearing disoriented as she tries to find her way out.  If you have any information of Princess Leia's whereabouts, please call your local police department.
"
13,6,Judge,"Alright Scouts and Dads, the racing continues. And it looks like our next heat is ready to go, in 3, 2, 1, race!  Two point one seconds for Tommy Bretts. Looks like we have a new leader, folks.
"
13,6,Tommy and His Dad,"All right!
"
13,6,Randy,"Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about ""tells.""
"
13,6,Stan,"Tells?
"
13,6,Randy,"When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
"
13,6,Randy,"Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. 
"
13,6,Official,"Looks good. Thank you and good luck today.  Alright, next please.  Name?
"
13,6,Stan,"It's uh, Marsh. 
"
13,6,Official,"Alright, car weighs in at 15 ounces. Do you hearby swear that you used parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit and only parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit?
"
13,6,Randy,"Yes I do, yes I do.
"
13,6,Stan,"Yes I do.
"
13,6,Official,"Alright you man, good luck today. 
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh! Yes! 
"
13,6,Mr. Hollis,"Well well, look son, it's the Marshes.
"
13,6,Randy,"Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?
"
13,6,Mr. Hollis,"No, little Emmett hasn't gone yet. Think they're saving the best for last.  Clocked her in at home at 1.5 seconds. It's the fastest car we've ever built.
"
13,6,Randy,"One point five?
"
13,6,Judge,"The time to beat is 1.9 seconds. May we please have... Brewster, Marsh, Jarvis, and Hollis. 
"
13,6,Mr. Hollis,"Huh, only fitting our boys should be going head to head for their match, hey Marsh? Heh. 
"
13,6,Randy,"Come on, Stan, you can do this! 
"
13,6,Judge,"Alright, kids, are you ready? Here we go, last race for the state championship in 3, 2, 1, Go! 
"
13,6,Mr. Hollis,"You got it Emmett!

13,6,Anchorman,"A Colorado boy and his father have set a new record at the Pinewood Derby.  Stan and Randy Marsh not only broke a speed record, but actually appear to have bent time and space and discovered warp speed.  A parade was held for the winners earlier today , and already offers for commercials and endorsement deals for the father and son appear to be pouring in.

13,6,Emmett,"Dad, I just want you to know I still love you.  Waaaagh!  He's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK-
"
13,6,Agent Clark,"Stan Marsh?
"
13,6,Stan,"Yeah?
"
13,6,Agent Clark,"I'm Agent Clark  and this is Agent Marx  We'd like to talk to you about your Pinewood Derby car.
"
13,6,Stan,"Aw crap, Dad! 
"
13,6,Agent Clark,"Young man, what we are about to tell you is a matter of national security. Yesterday every country and embassy on Earth was contacted by... an alien life force.
"
13,6,Stan,"Alien?
"
13,6,Agent Marx,"Apparently the alien came across your Pinewood Derby car and is now headed to our planet.
"
13,6,Stan,"What does it want?
"
13,6,Agent Clark,"We believe that they intend to welcome us into the Galactic Federation of Planets. They will want to meet the people who discovered warp speed for our species.
"
13,6,Randy,"Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad they aren't here for that.
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.

13,6,Agent Clark,"Mr. Marsh, we were just telling your son that thanks to you, we have made first contact with alien life.
"
13,6,Randy,"What?  Hey, hey Sharon.
"
13,6,Agent Marx,"NASA's confirmed that an alien ship has entered our solar system and it is headed here,
"
13,6,Randy,"So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.
"
13,6,Sharon,"What? Oh my God.
"
13,6,Randy,"Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?
"
13,6,Reporter,"The world holds its breath as an alien ship prepares to land. Now that our planet has achieved warp speed, we're about to be welcomed into the universal society. All thanks to a father and son who broke the warp barrier using only the parts in this  Pinewood Derby car kit.
"
13,6,General,"Mr. Marsh, you are on with all the world leaders. 
"
13,6,Randy,"Hullo?
"
13,6,Britain,"Godspeed, Mr.Marsh.
"
13,6,France,"Ze nation of France iz with you.

13,6,Japan,"Good ruck witha 'harien, Mista Marsh.
"
13,6,China,"Prease say herro froma China.
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. 
"
13,6,Reporter,"Our first encounter with extraterrestrial life is about to happen. Will it be like in Star Trek: First Contact? Or will it be more like Contact, with Jody Foster? 
"
13,6,Alien,"I seek the life forms that made this. 
"
13,6,Randy,"That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.
"
13,6,Alien,"Oh yeah?  You're gonna build me another one, see?
"
13,6,Randy,"He's got a gun!
"
13,6,Alien,"Everyone down on the ground!  Get those hands up! Let me see those hands! Do it now! I mean it! Show me those hands! I'm Baby Fark McGee-zax, the greatest gangster this universe has ever seen, right?!
"
13,6,Townsman,"You can't threaten us!  Ow!
"
13,6,McGee-zax,"Who wants it next, huh?!  Anyone else on this planet wanna be a hero? 
"
13,6,Randy,"What do you want?
"
13,6,McGee-zax,"I'm on the lam. Got the entire Federation of Planets after me. But they ain't gonna catch me, ya got that?! They might have busted my warp drive, but you obviously know how to make 'em! 
"
13,6,New Yorker,"Screw this guy! He can't take out all of us!  Aargh!
"
13,6,McGee-zax,"I can kill any mug on this two-bit planet I want!  You build me a new warp drive or you're all gonna get it, see?!
"
13,6,Judge,"Fine. He can build you what you want. All he needs is the official Pinewood Derby kit. Right Marsh?
"
13,6,Randy,"Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy.
"
13,6,Randy,"Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.
"
13,6,McGee-zax,"What's takin' so long?! You're stallin'!
"
13,6,Stephen,"Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone.
"
13,6,Randy,"We're working on it! 
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
"
13,6,Randy,"Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.
"
13,6,Stan,"Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
"
13,6,Randy,"Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!
"
13,6,McGee-zax,"Alright, that does it! 
"
13,6,Randy,"Hello?
"
13,6,Italy,"They justa blew up our government building! Ya got to hurry!
"
13,6,Britain,"Mr. Marsh, why won't you finish the Pinewood Derby car?!
"
13,6,Randy,"Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
"
13,6,Stan,"Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.
"
13,6,Randy,"Awhuh. 
"
13,6,McGee-zax,"Aw zahts, it's the intergalactic police.
"
13,6,Randy,"What?! 
"
13,6,McGee-zax,"You'd better get rid of 'em or your whole planet is gonna get it, see?!  You tell 'em you ain't seen nothin', you got that?!  I ain't goin' to space jail! 
"
13,6,Officer 1,"'Scuse us, Earthlings, but uh, we've been in pursuit of a criminal from the Xenon galaxy. Fella by the name of Baby Fark McGee-zax?
"
13,6,Randy,"Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything.
"
13,6,Officer 1,"Well, ya think anyone else on your planet might have seen him?
"
13,6,Randy,"Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.
"
13,6,China,"Uh uh no, no, we haven't seen arien.
"
13,6,France,"Uh we've seen nothing here in France.
"
13,6,Randy,"Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?
"
13,6,Officer 1,"He stole over 600 parsohns of space cash from the universal bank. You're absolutely sure you didn't see an alien land here?
"
13,6,Randy,"No, we're sure.
"
13,6,Officer 1,"So then... we're the first aliens you've ever seen?
"
13,6,Randy,"That's right, yep, you're the first ones.
"
13,6,Officer 1,"You don't seem that excited about your first contact with alien life.
"
13,6,Randy,"...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!
"
13,6,Officer 1,"If you do see any sign of the other alien or the space cash you-
"
13,6,Randy,"We will give you a call!
"
13,6,Officer 1,"Mathematical semi-tonal is fine. 
"
13,6,Officer 1,"Huh.
"
13,6,Officer 2,"Something wrong, sir?
"
13,6,Officer 1,"I don't know, Davert. Just somethin' about that planet didn't feel right. 
"
13,6,Randy,"Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.
"
13,6,McGee-zax,"I don't need it painted, I just need it functional, all right?! 
"
13,6,Randy,"Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!
"
13,6,Scout Leader,"That's true.
"
13,6,McGee-zax,"I swear, if you don't have that thing workin' in three minutes this whole planet is done for!
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
"
13,6,Randy,"No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.
"
13,6,Stan,"Kill the alien?
"
13,6,Randy,"Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.
"
13,6,Stan,"No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.
"
13,6,McGee-zax,"What are you two whispering about, riiight?
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad? 
"
13,6,Randy,"Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!
"
13,6,General,"Alright men, check the ship. 
"
13,6,Randy,"You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
"
13,6,Stan,"I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
"
13,6,Randy,"But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.
"
13,6,General,"Hey Marsh, get in here! 
"
13,6,Stephen,"Can you believe it?
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh my God. Spaaace caaash. 
"
13,6,General,"Looks like those alien cops were right. Guess you should call them back now.
"
13,6,Randy,"Right.  But what if we didn't call the cops?
"
13,6,Stephen,"Huh?
"
13,6,Randy,"Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.
"
13,6,Stan,"No, Dad-
"
13,6,Mr. Garrison,"He's right. We don't have to call the police back.
"
13,6,General,"All right, let's get the cash put into boxes! 
"
13,6,Stan,"Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?
"
13,6,Randy,"Will you relax, Stan? 
"
13,6,Japan,"Don't think you can keep the all the space cash for yourself!
"
13,6,Germany,"That's right! This is all of our planet; the space cash belongs to all of us!
"
13,6,Australia,"Either America shares that space cash with the rest of the world or we will tell the space cops!
"
13,6,Randy,"Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.
"
13,6,Officer 1,"Looks like the alien criminal did land here after all.
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.
"
13,6,Officer 1,"And so, did you find the missing space cash?
"
13,6,Randy,"Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.
"
13,6,Officer 2,"Well maybe someone else on your planet knows where it is?
"
13,6,Randy,"Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?
"
13,6,Russia,"No space cash.
"
13,6,Japan,"No we haven't-
"
13,6,Britain,"No space cash.
"
13,6,Brazil,"No.
"
13,6,Randy,"Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.
"
13,6,Officer 1,"Uh huh. Guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet.
"
13,6,Randy,"Probably.
"
13,6,Officer 1,"Well you folks all take care now.  Just... one more thing, Earthlings, uh... We had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries - Mexico? - has built 32 new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days.
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.
"
13,6,Officer 1,"Uh huh. Have a good day. 
"
13,6,Randy,"Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
"
13,6,Randy,"No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!
"
13,6,Japan,"Well then why can Engrand build a nuclear power plant?!
"
13,6,Randy,"Nobody can build anything!!
"
13,6,Britain,"Yeah, well, it's not even gonna matter, because Finland is thinking about telling the space cops the truth!
"
13,6,Randy,"Wha?! Finland?! 
"
13,6,Finland,"We believe the aliens are going to find out sooner or later what we did. It's best we come clean now.
"
13,6,Randy,"Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.
"
13,6,Finland,"I'm sorry, but our nation is resolved. We cannot live with the guilt anymore.
"
13,6,Randy,"Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?
"
13,6,Finland,"Very well. 
"
13,6,Randy,"All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.
"
13,6,China,"Yep, we gotta take out Finrand, they gonna squeal.
"
13,6,Australia,"Yeah, I think we all agree. Guys? 
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh dammit!
"
13,6,Randy,"Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?
"
13,6,Officer 1,"Well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries? Uh, Finland?
"
13,6,Randy,"Whaa-wha-what about it
"
13,6,Officer 2,"It appears to have been... destroyed.
"
13,6,Randy,"Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland.
"
13,6,Crowd,"Oh no, not Finland.
"
13,6,Randy,"Hey guys, Finland's dead.
"
13,6,Russia,"Oh no. No! Nooo.
"
13,6,Japan,"Noo, not a Finrand!
"
13,6,Kenya,"All of Finland, gone.
"
13,6,Randy,"Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.
"
13,6,Officer 1,"None of you knew anything about Finland's destruction?
"
13,6,Randy,"No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.
"
13,6,Officer 2,"We didn't say anything about nukes.
"
13,6,Randy,"Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.
"
13,6,Stan,"'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! 
"
13,6,Judge,"What?
"
13,6,Randy,"Stan?
"
13,6,Stan,"The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. 
"
13,6,Japan,"Not in the approved kit?!
"
13,6,Britain,"He cheated on the Pinewood Derby?
"
13,6,Stan,"This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 
"
13,6,Randy,"Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.
"
13,6,Officer 1,"Your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words. You sure you Earthlings have nothing else to tell us?
"
13,6,Randy,"Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?
"
13,6,Britain,"Nope.
"
13,6,France,"Nope.
"
13,6,South Korea,"No changes.
"
13,6,Kenya,"Nope.
"
13,6,Russia,"No changes.
"
13,6,Brazil,"Nope.
"
13,6,China,"No. Tell them no.
"
13,6,Australia,"No changes.
"
13,6,Randy,"Yeah, no, we've told you everything.
"
13,6,Officer 1,"All right, that's it then. Come on out sir, it appears to be over. 
"
13,6,Randy,"Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!
"
13,6,McGee-zax,"My real name is Kevern Zaksor. I am the ambassador to new planet testing. 
"
13,6,Britain,"What the hell are they talking about?
"
13,6,Kevern Zaksor,"These are not space cops.  There is no space jail, and space cash is only worth what you as a planet decided it was worth. I mean, how stupid is your species? Space jail? Baby Fark McGee-zax?
"
13,6,Randy,"It was... a trick?
"
13,6,Officer 2,"Whenever a civilization discovers warp speed, we want to bring them into the Federation of Planets, but first we do the space cash test, to see if that species is worthy of joining.
"
13,6,Kevern Zaksor,"Needless to say, you all failed.  People of earth, since you did not return the space cash, your species and your planet is hereby forever blocked off and barred from the rest of the universe. Goodbye. 
"
13,6,Randy,"No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!
"
13,7,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
"
13,7,Butters,"We can?
"
13,7,Stan,"What are you talking about, dude?
"
13,7,Cartman,"Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.
"
13,7,Clyde,"Somalia? Where's that?
"
13,7,Cartman,"North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
"
13,7,Butters,"Whoa.
"
13,7,Cartman,"I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.
"
13,7,Kyle,"Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.
"
13,7,Kyle,"No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
"
13,7,Kyle,"Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Then why don't you wanna go?
"
13,7,Kyle,"Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
"
13,7,"Kyle, Cartman","Jews can't be pirates.
"
13,7,Cartman,"That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! 
"
13,7,Kyle,"Please. Please let him go.
"
13,7,Gordon Stoltski,"Good morning, students. These are the morning announcements. Teacher-parent conferences have been rescheduled to next Tuesday.  Please inform your parents. The gym is being repainted, and is closed until tomorrow afternoon. And now for a special announcement:

"
13,7,Cartman,"But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.
"
13,7,Gordon Stoltski,"Fine, I don't wanna be a pirate anyways! 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!
"
13,7,Butters,"Yeah!
"
13,7,Cartman,"We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
"
13,7,Clyde,"And your mom is okay with that?
"
13,7,Cartman,"Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?
"
13,7,Butters,"Neato!

13,7,Cartman,"Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits!

"
13,7,Clerk,"I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?
"
13,7,Cartman,"That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
"
13,7,Butters,"Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
"
13,7,Cartman,"What?!
"
13,7,Butters,"It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
"
13,7,Clyde,"Yeah maybe we should think about this.
"
13,7,Cartman,"You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
"
13,7,Butters,"Huh, who, you mean you?
"
13,7,Cartman,"Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
"
13,7,Butters,"No, I'm sick of it!
"
13,7,Cartman,"Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
"
13,7,Butters,"He's right, lads. To adventure!
"
13,7,Clyde,"This is Somalia?
"
13,7,Butters,"Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
"
13,7,Cartman,"The FUCK?!  'Scuse me, where are the pirates?  Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh!  Butters, get the phrase book out.  Ask these people where the pirates are.

13,7,Cartman,"Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Avast!  These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people.
"
13,7,Pirate 1,"""Is this some kind of joke?""
"
13,7,Pirate 2,"""I don't know what the fuck this is!""
"
13,7,Cartman,"I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with
"
13,7,Pirate 1,"""These white children will bring a high price in ransom money!""
"
13,7,Pirate 2,"""Take them out to the nearest European boat! Show them we have children hostages!"" 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.
"
13,7,Pirate 3,"""Move it! Go over that way!""
"
13,7,Pirate 4,"""We will get a nice ransom for you!"" 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. 
"
13,7,Pirate 3,"""Get on board!""

"
13,7,Cartman,"This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!

"
13,7,Cartman,"Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.
"
13,7,Kevin,"I gotta sit middle 'cause I get motion sickness. 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Kevin, Jesus Christ!  Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah!  Clyde, the fuck?!

13,7,Cartman,"Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!
"
13,7,Clyde,"No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
"
13,7,Cartman,"Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please?  Very nice, Ike.  All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder!

13,7,Kyle,"Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
"
13,7,Stan,"No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.
"
13,7,Kyle,"Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
"
13,7,Stan,"You really think he'll die in Somalia?
"
13,7,Kyle,"Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.

"
13,7,Kyle,"What? Are you sure?
"
13,7,Sheila,"He left a note saying he's never coming back.
"
13,7,Kyle,"""Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-"" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
"
13,7,Sheila,"Oh Gerald, what are we gonna do?
"
13,7,Gerald,"It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. 
"
13,7,Kyle,"Oh God. What have I done?
"
13,7,Pirate 4,"""We are growing impatient! Give us what we want or they die!""
"
13,7,Cartman,"The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
"
13,7,French Captain,"""Alright! Alright! We are going to give you what you want! But you must hand over the children UNHARMED!""
"
13,7,Pirate 5,"""The money first!""  ""Go! Get on the boat! Move!""

13,7,Paolo Captain,"We found then adrift in a lifeboat, sir. They say that pirates took their ship by force.
"
13,7,U.N. Leader,"Damn pirates! What's causing them to suddenly be so much more active? Is the crew okay?
"
13,7,Paolo Captain,"Yes sir. They're French, so they surrendered immediately.  Once the pirates boarded your ship how did they force you off?
"
13,7,French Captain,"Il a vert lightsabeur.
"
13,7,Cruise Attendant,"Oui. Un lightsabeur
"
13,7,Deck Hand,"Le lightsabeur terrible. 
"
13,7,Paolo Captain,"Sir, the pirates appear to have forced the French crew off their boat with a lightsaber.
"
13,7,U.N. Leader,"My God, pirates are getting better-equipped every day! Gentlemen, I want the President of the United States on the phone. We can no longer fight the pirates on the seas. We have to take them out where they live.
"
13,7,Cartman,"What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh?  What's going on?
"
13,7,Pirate 6,"""We have a hostage!""
"
13,7,Pirate 7,"""Another American arrived on the bus!""
"
13,7,Cartman,"Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom.  Well well well well well!
"
13,7,Announcer,"The is CNN... N.
"
13,7,Anchorman,"Breaking news of yet another pirate crisis in Somalia. Members of NATO received word today that pirates have captured an American child and are demanding ten million Euros for his safe release. U.S Navy ships have been deployed and the pirate standoff is about to get ugly.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
"
13,7,Kyle,"No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
"
13,7,Cartman,"""It isn't safe."" That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was ""awesome.""
"
13,7,Kyle,"I know! I was lying then!
"
13,7,Cartman,"Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
"
13,7,Kyle,"This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
"
13,7,Cartman,"Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.
"
13,7,Butters,"One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
"
13,7,Pirate 4,"Ey excuse me. Can I ask you a question?
"
13,7,Butters,"Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.
"
13,7,Galeed,"Why did you Americans come here?
"
13,7,Butters,"Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
"
13,7,Ike,"Yeah, homework.
"
13,7,Butters,"And our parents hollered at us!
"
13,7,Ike,"Yeah.
"
13,7,Butters,"So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
"
13,7,Ike,"Piewets!
"
13,7,Galeed,"But that's not what I do not understand. Why would anyone ""want"" to be a pirate?
"
13,7,Butters,"Huh?
"
13,7,Galeed,"Every day I dream that I can go to school. Learn about the world. But my mother, she is dyin' of AIDS, and there is no money for medicine. My father was killed trying to find food for us. Do you know how I feel every time we try to capture a boat? Scared. And not just scared because I might get killed, but scared because if I don't get something out of it, my family and friends are going to die. I don't want to be a pirate. I don't see how anybody would. 
"
13,7,Ike,"Oh my God. 
"
13,7,Butters,"Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
"
13,7,Ike,"I feel, like an asshole.
"
13,7,Butters,"Yeah, me too.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!
"
13,7,Kyle,"Cartman, knock it off!
"
13,7,Cartman,"That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle!
"
13,7,Pirate 6,"""Do you think all American kids are as crazy as these are?""
"
13,7,Pirate 8,"""It's starting to look that way.""
"
13,7,Butters,"Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
"
13,7,Cartman,"What?!
"
13,7,Butters,"Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Clyde!
"
13,7,Clyde,"I hate it here and I wanna go home!! 
"
13,7,Cartman,"You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!
"
13,7,Kyle,"They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
"
13,7,Cartman,"Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!
"
13,7,Pirate 5,"""Hey, what's that?"" 
"
13,7,Commander,"Alright men, remember, do not hit the white ones!
"
13,7,Cartman,"Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! 
"
13,7,Sniper,"Clear.
"
13,7,Cartman,"The FUCK?!
"
13,8,Gerald,"You have been very very naughty!  You're a naughty girl! 
"
13,8,Sheila,"Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty!  Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! 
"
13,8,Gerald,"What the?! ...Ike!  Ike, get back to bed right now!
"
13,8,Ike,"I'm scared. There's a ghost.
"
13,8,Gerald,"Uh not this again.  Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!
"
13,8,Ike,"But Daddy I saw the-
"
13,8,Gerald,"No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! 
"
13,8,Sheila,"Gerald, what has gotten into him?
"
13,8,Gerald,"Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he he's just freaked himself out.
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for Megascrub Cleanser.
"
13,8,Ike,"AAAAAAAAA!
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Are you tired of your kitchen counters getting those nasty stains? Don't just rub 'em, Megascrub 'em!
"
13,8,Ike,"Billy Mays, NO! 
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Mold, mildew, even those impossible wine stains are gone in a flash when you snipe them away.
"
13,8,Ike,"MMOOMMMYYY!  AAAAAA! Farrah Fawcett! Farrah Fawcett!  AAAAAA! David Carradine! 
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for Mighty Mend It, the fast and easy way to mend, hem, and wear it again. 
"
13,8,Ike,"NOOOOO!
"
13,8,Kyle,"Ike! Ike, what?!
"
13,8,Ike,"Make Billy Mays go away! Make Billy Mays go away!  Make him stop!  Make him stop, Kyle!
"
13,8,Dr. Land,"Now Ike, your family is very worried about you. Ike, you can talk to me. I'm a therapist. Whatever has been troubling you, it's okay.
"
13,8,Ike,"No, it's... it's a secret.
"
13,8,Dr. Land,"Ike, tell me your secret. I promise not to tell anyone else.
"
13,8,Ike,"I see dead... ce-le-bri-ties.
"
13,8,Dr. Land,"You mean, you see dead celebrities on TV? In the news?
"
13,8,Ike,"I see them walking around. They talk to me.
"
13,8,Dr. Land,"Are you seeing any dead celebrities right now?
"
13,8,Ike,"Just Ed McMahon. 
"
13,8,Dr. Land,"How often do you see dead celebrities?
"
13,8,Ike,"All the time. 
"
13,8,Cartman,"'Sup, Jew?
"
13,8,Kyle,"Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
"
13,8,Cartman,"HA! What a dumbass! 
"
13,8,Kyle,"I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name ""Billy Mays"" over and over again.
"
13,8,Cartman,"Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!
"
13,8,Kyle,"What?
"
13,8,Cartman,"Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
"
13,8,Stan,"Dude, I don't even know who that is.
"
13,8,Cartman,"The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here!  Here here! This, this is him!
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product. If you're like other Americans, you love to eat Chipotle , but you hate all those terrible bloodstains in your underwear .
"
13,8,Man 1,"I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare. 
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Well now there's a product that can clean even bloodstains caused by Chipotle right off your underwear. Chipotl-away.  Just one Chipotle burrito  can leave up to a quarter cup of underwear blood , but Chipotl-away  makes your underwear clean  and ready for more.  Stop buying new underwear every time you eat Chipotle. That can cost you thousands. Chipotl-away gets rid of bloodstains and leaves underwear good as new.  Imagine having underwear so clean you can practically eat off of it.
"
13,8,Man 2,"Mmm, Chipotle. 
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Now you can eat all the Chipotle you want , and still have underwear that sparkles and shines . Order right now!
"
13,8,Cartman,"That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
"
13,8,Kyle,"What?! Are you serious?!
"
13,8,Cartman,"Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
"
13,8,Cartman,"Because he was a great person, Kyle.
"
13,8,Kyle,"NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
"
13,8,Cartman,"...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...
"
13,8,Announcer,"On this episode of Ghost Hunters : a little boy in Colorado appears to be haunted by celebrities.  Now the Ghost Hunter team will roll out and get to the bottom of it. It's the gayest show in the fucking world; Ghost Hunters!
"
13,8,Jason,"Alright, tell us what we got this week, Kris.
"
13,8,Kris,"We're going to Colorado to investigate celebrity paranorm-
"
13,8,Jason,"Wait, what? What was that? What was that?
"
13,8,Grant,"I heard it too. It was like a, like a ...*pop*
"
13,8,Jason,"Is there a ghost here?
"
13,8,Jason,"Alright, so you say a little boy is seeing the ghosts?
"
13,8,Kris,"Yeah, apparently only he is seeing them.
"
13,8,Jason,"Doyuh ssh ssh. What, what is that? Do you hear that?! There, there look. What is that? What is that?
"
13,8,Grant,"I think that's just a cigarette lighter.
"
13,8,Jason,"Oh, right, okay. May be.
"
13,8,Jason,"We are now inside the house where the celebrity ghosts have been spotted. Whoa whoa what? What was that?
"
13,8,Kyle,"What was what?
"
13,8,Jason,"Did you hear that? It was like a... it was like a... dee.. Is there a spooky ghost here?? Uh LOOK. What is that? What is that?? 
"
13,8,Grant,"I'm pretty sure that's their television.
"
13,8,Jason,"Oh man I am really scared.  Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What is this? What is this? There's a, there's a, a wetness coming from my pants! 
"
13,8,Grant,"I see it!
"
13,8,Jason,"W... what is it?!
"
13,8,Grant,"Oh God I'm so scared!  I'm so scared.
"
13,8,Jason,"Look! Look, it's got you too!  Are you getting this? Make sure the camera is getting this. Definitely some paranormal activity!
"
13,8,Grant,"It's warm, and moist. A warm moist sensation that's moving down my left thigh. 
"
13,8,Jason,"Look, it's starting to form a, a a pool around the floor now. Are you getting this??
"
13,8,Stan,"Are you guys fucking serious?
"
13,8,Jason,"Oh God, the paranormal activity is now leaving a, a trail of some kind behind both of us! 
"
13,8,Grant,"Hoh! Something... hot, and and, warm is coming out the back of my pants now. 
"
13,8,Jason,"Oh it smells!
"
13,8,TAPS,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
13,8,Kyle,"Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for the Big City Slider Station.
"
13,8,Kyle,"It's all just in your head, Ike.
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"The fast and easy way to press and cook delicious sliders
"
13,8,Ike,"AAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAA!! 
"
13,8,Kyle,"I just... don't understand it.
"
13,8,Stan,"It's gonna be alright, Kyle.
"
13,8,Kyle,"But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
"
13,8,Cartman,"Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
"
13,8,Kyle,"But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?
"
13,8,Stan,"Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
"
13,8,Cartman,"Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.
"
13,8,Dr. Carroll,"Well boys, little Ike is stable, but the celebrity ghosts appear to have sent him into some kind of coma.
"
13,8,Stan,"Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?
"
13,8,Dr. Carroll,"Well of course there really are ghosts. Haven't you seen that show Ghost Hunters? But I'm a pediatric doctor, so I'm going to hand this off to Dr. Phillips, who specializes in spooky things. 
"
13,8,Dr. Phillips,"The ghosts of these celebrities are at deep unrest. I've never sensed anything like it.  I believe these celebrity ghosts are still roamin' the world, reachin' out through the child because they are lost in purgatory.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Purgatory? What's that?
"
13,8,Dr. Phillips,"Sometimes when people die, they can't quite accept what has happened to them. And so before they reach the afterlife, they go to a place called ""purgatory."" It is a temporary plane of existence. It's neither heaven, nor hell. Purgatory is like... being on an airplane that's waiting to take off, but you're still sitting at the gate. And even though the plane isn't taking off, they won't let you back off the plane. And you can't get up to go to the bathroom, because you're on an active runway. All these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on, but for whatever reason, they are stuck without any information, even from the pilot, how much longer it's going to be, and it's taking forever. And they aren't serving any drinks yet. It's like, a terrifying limbo.
"
13,8,Cartman,"Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...
"
13,8,Dr. Phillips,"I am speakin to the celebrities that are hauntin' this child. If any spirit can hear my voice, make your presence known. 
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product.
"
13,8,Cartman,"Billy Mays!  It's him!
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down?
"
13,8,Cartman,"Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!
"
13,8,Walter Cronkite,"No! Be quiet, Billy Mays! Somebody is trying to contact us!
"
13,8,Dr. Phillips,"To which celebrity am I addressin' now?
"
13,8,Walter Cronkite,"This, is Walter Cronkite.
"
13,8,Dr. Phillips,"All you celebrities need to know that you have passed on.
"
13,8,Farrah Fawcett,"We know that!
"
13,8,DJ AM,"Yeah! Of course we know that!
"
13,8,Patrick Swayze,"There's only one person here who's not cooperating!
"
13,8,Walter Cronkite,"That's right! Now just admit you're dead and sit down!
"
13,8,Michael Jackson,"...No, that's ignorant! I'm not dead.
"
13,8,Stan,"Uh oh.
"
13,8,Walter Cronkite,"You are dead!
"
13,8,Michael Jackson,"No, I just have a skin condition.
"
13,8,Dr. Phillips,"Boys, quickly! Convince Michael Jackson that he's dead.
"
13,8,Kyle,"What?
"
13,8,Dr. Phillips,"He's in denial. He's been in denial all his life. Now tell him or you're gonna lose your little brother.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
"
13,8,Michael Jackson,"Nooo, you're being ignorant. I'm alive. And I'm a child. And I'm white.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for the Super Sweeper.
"
13,8,The Boys (except Cartman) and Dr. Phillips,"Shut up, Billy Mays!
"
13,8,Stan,"You're dead, Mr. Jackson!
"
13,8,Michael Jackson,"No, that's, that's just ignorant.
"
13,8,Stan,"Accept it! 
"
13,8,Michael Jackson,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
13,8,Dr. Phillips,"He's in too much denial!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
"
13,8,Ike,"Nooo. No, that's ignorant.  Oh look everyone, I told you I was alive.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
"
13,8,Ike,"Wee, I'm a child!  I knew I was a child. See? Come on, let's play! Let's go climb a tree! 
"
13,8,Kenny,"(Holy shit, dude!)
"
13,8,Kyle,"Comoe back here! 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Hey! Heeey!
"
13,8,Ike,"Come on, let's climb the tree! Hee hee!
"
13,8,Stan,"Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
"
13,8,Ike,"Noo, I'm a little white child. Let's play!  Hee! Hee hee!  Hee hee hee! 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
"
13,8,Cartman,"Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
"
13,8,Ike,"No, that's ignorant. People are just ignorant and they lie and spread rumors about me. Like, that I'm dead. But if I was dead, how could I do this?  Hoo! Dawdaby daw! Shamon! 
"
13,8,Kyle,"What the hell are we going to do??
"
13,8,Ike,"Jou know! Jou know it! Hee hee!
"
13,8,Ed McMahon,"Come on, this is ridiculous! How much longer do we have to sit in purgatory?!
"
13,8,Passengers,"Come on! Come on! This is ridiculous! Come on!
"
13,8,Flight Attendant,"Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your patience. I've been informed that we are going to be delayed at least another 96 hours
"
13,8,Passengers,"AWWWWWWWW!
"
13,8,DJ AM,"Yo, you can't just keep people stuck like this, man!
"
13,8,Flight Attendant,"We know that you are all excited to cross over to the next plane, but for now you have to stay on this one.
"
13,8,Walter Cronkite,"That's it! I have to go to the bathroom!
"
13,8,Flight Attendant,"Sir, you have to stay in your seat with your seatbelt fastened!
"
13,8,Walter Cronkite,"You've been saying that for three months now! 
"
13,8,Stan,"Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...
"
13,8,Kyle,"Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
"
13,8,Cartman,"Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.
"
13,8,Kyle,"So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
"
13,8,Cartman,"Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
"
13,8,Cartman,"Yes!
"
13,8,Kyle,"And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
"
13,8,Cartman,"Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! 
"
13,8,Stan,"Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
"
13,8,Kyle,"What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
"
13,8,Cartman,"A child... and a female. And white.
"
13,8,Ike,"Oh lookie, it's a planet. Hee hee hee.
"
13,8,Stan,"So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 
"
13,8,MC,"Hello. First up we have the beautiful Miss Jessica. 
"
13,8,Jessica's Mom,"Alright Jessica! Woohoo! 
"
13,8,MC,"Jessica enjoys ridin' her horse Marley and doin' her nails with her sisters. Next, contestant number 26, Miss Brandy 
"
13,8,Brandy's Mom,"Yeah Brandy! Work it girl!
"
13,8,MC,"Brandy likes ice cream and playing with her cat Sunshine.
"
13,8,Brandy's Mom,"Don't forget to blow a kiss to the judges, Brandy. 
"
13,8,MC,"And now welcome contestant number 27, little Miss Michael Jackson. 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Go on by, Michael. 
"
13,8,Cartman,"Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
"
13,8,Stan,"Yeahhhh!
"
13,8,MC,"Michael says she just enjoys being a child. She loves to play and climb trees, and thinks people who don't are ignorant.
"
13,8,Ike,"Ignorant.
"
13,8,Cartman,"God I hope this works.
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for the little Country Handy Pillow. Are you tired of sitting in limbo? Lost somewhere between planes of existence? Well now there's a product that can help you-
"
13,8,Walter Cronkite,"Will somebody shut his fucking mouth?! I can't take it anymore!
"
13,8,Patrick Swayze,"This is bad enough without having to constantly listen to you try and sell your stupid crap, Mays!
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"With just two easy steps, I can climb over these seats and kick you right in the fucking balls!
"
13,8,David Carradine,"That does it. We are not gonna just sit here anymore! We want some Goddamned answers!
"
13,8,Walter Cronkite,"Why isn't anybody telling us anything?!
"
13,8,Pilot,"Well ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking.
"
13,8,Walter Cronkite,"Well it's about fucking time!
"
13,8,Pilot,"Certainly want to uhhh thank you for all your patience. We know that you're eager to uhhhh get going and we will certainly pass on any information uhhhhh as it becomes uhhhhhh more available.
"
13,8,DJ AM,"But yo! Yo Michael Jackson isn't even here anymore! He's gone! We should be able to move on now!
"
13,8,Flight Attendant,"Yes, but as we all know, Mr. Jackson had a LOT of baggage, and he checked some of that baggage in, so a crew has to go through all the baggage and get his off of purgatory before we can push back from the gate.
"
13,8,Passengers,"AWWWWWWWW!
"
13,8,Ike,"Did I do good in the swimsuit category? I'm worried that little doodoohead brunette girl was prettier than me.
"
13,8,Stan,"Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.
"
13,8,Kylie's Mom,"It's more important for my little Kylie. Just look at this face.
"
13,8,Kylie,"Mommy, that hurts my cheek implants. 
"
13,8,MC,"All right, thank you Miss Cassie. And now for her talent portion, Miss Michael Jackson is gonna sing for us. 
"
13,8,Ike,"I'm just a little girl. Hee hee. A dainty little thing.And I know you all want to be a little white girl like me. Shamohn! Hee hee hee.  Hohhh
"
13,8,Stan,"Dude, the two male judges love her.
"
13,8,Kenny,"(Yeah.) 
"
13,8,An Officer,"All right, that's about enough! 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Aww crap!
"
13,8,Cartman,"Hey, what the F?!
"
13,8,MC,"All right everyone, the judge will now tally her final scores.
"
13,8,Kyle,"We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!
"
13,8,Stan,"Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
"
13,8,Heidi's Mom,"You'll win for sure, Heidi. You know how much that judge adores you.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Aw dide, this is hopeless!
"
13,8,Kenny,"(Son of a stinking bitch!)
"
13,8,Cartman,"Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.
"
13,8,Kyle,"So what?!
"
13,8,Cartman,"So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.
"
13,8,Lady Judge,"Oh yes, it's my favorite fast food. I would eat it every day, except I-... 
"
13,8,Cartman,"Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
"
13,8,Lady Judge,"How did you know-... Look, it doesn't matter.  I'm just gonna have to give it up.
"
13,8,Cartman,"What if you didn't have to give it up?
"
13,8,Lady Judge,"Excuse me?
"
13,8,Cartman,"I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.
"
13,8,MC,"And now, it is time to announce our Grand Little Miss. Little Miss Michael Jackson. 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
13,8,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
13,8,Stan,"Woohoo!
"
13,8,Cartman,"Good job Ike! 
"
13,8,Heidi,"I'm sorry I didn't win, Mommy. 
"
13,8,Ike,"Thank you so much for this award. Of all the awards I've ever won, this one means the most. I feel like... I'm finally at rest. I'm finally at rest! I'm free!  Holy shit! What the heck am I wwwearing?
"
13,8,Kyle,"Ike!  Ike, you're back!
"
13,8,Ike,"Kyle, what the heck is going on?
"
13,8,Kyle,"It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
"
13,8,Cartman,"Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.
"
13,8,Michael Jackson,"Wee, I'm free! I'm free! 
"
13,8,Farrah Fawcett,"Hey he's here! He's here!
"
13,8,Bea Arthur,"Oh, finally.
"
13,8,Others,"He's here! He's back!
"
13,8,Flight Attendant,"All right everyone, it looks like we are all ready to move on. 
"
13,8,Michael Jackson,"Did you all see my crown? 
"
13,8,Billy Mays,"Finally! Finally we can all move on!
"
13,8,Flight Attendant,"All right, everyone, I'd like to be the first to welcome you to the gates of Hell. Unfortunately, Hell is a tow-in gate.
"
13,8,Passengers,"AWWWWWWWW!
"
13,9,Cartman,"Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" Come on, dude, ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" 
"
13,9,Butters,"I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
"
13,9,Cartman,"Alright, your turn Craig.
"
13,9,Butters,"Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
"
13,9,Cartman,"Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
"
13,9,Butters,"Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.
"
13,9,Stan,"Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
"
13,9,Cartman,"Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl 
"
13,9,Butters,"Uugh!
"
13,9,Kyle,"So what?
"
13,9,Butters,"So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
"
13,9,Craig,"That's right. 
"
13,9,Clyde,"You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.
"
13,9,Butters,"Sellin' kisses?
"
13,9,Clyde,"She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.
"
13,9,Butters,"You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
"
13,9,Clyde,"So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh boy, I sure am nervous.
"
13,9,Cartman,"Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
"
13,9,Kyle,"Butters, I think you should reconsider this.
"
13,9,Butters,"Uh, how come?
"
13,9,Kyle,"Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
"
13,9,Cartman,"Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
"
13,9,Butters,"I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
"
13,9,Francis,"Pretty worth it. 
"
13,9,Jimmy,"Go ahead, Bu-Butters. Go- go get some.
"
13,9,Butters,"I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.
"
13,9,Sally,"Hey. 
"
13,9,Butters,"So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
"
13,9,Sally,"Okay, cool.
"
13,9,Butters,"Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. 
"
13,9,Sally,"So you got money?
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 
"
13,9,Sally,"All right, you ready? 
"
13,9,Butters,"Thank you! 
"
13,9,Cartman,"Atta boy Butters!
"
13,9,Tweek,"You did it!
"
13,9,Jimmy,"You're a man now! All right Butters good job!
"
13,9,Token,"Good job, Butters!
"
13,9,Butters,"Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.
"
13,9,Butters,"Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
"
13,9,Scott,"She'll kiss anybody?
"
13,9,Butters,"Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!
"
13,9,Scott,"Wow.  It's almost like having someone care about you. 
"
13,9,Sally,"Jeez Butters, thanks for bringing me yet another customer. Here's your two dollar cut again.
"
13,9,Butters,"Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
"
13,9,Sally,"Oh, that'd be great, but I can't do kisses before school. I have swimming class.
"
13,9,Butters,"Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
"
13,9,Sally,"What?
"
13,9,Butters,"Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
"
13,9,Sally,"Wow, you're right Butters. I should start expanding.
"
13,9,Butters,"We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
"
13,9,Butters,"The next key to a successful business is ""innovation."" I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
"
13,9,Sally,"Wow, that's a great idea, Butters.
"
13,9,Butters,"Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
"
13,9,Megan,"Got it.
"
13,9,Butters,"I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
"
13,9,Sally,"This is gonna be great!
"
13,9,Murphy,"Sir! Sir, take a look at this. We've got rumors coming in of a possible ""prostitution company"" starting up in South Park.
"
13,9,Yates,"What?!  Hohoo, not in my county!
"
13,9,Murphy,"We've got no information on the prostitutes, don't know who they are or where they came from.
"
13,9,Yates,"So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!
"
13,9,Murphy,"Sting operation, sir?
"
13,9,Yates,"We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!
"
13,9,Yates,"Hey baby, you looking for a party?
"
13,9,Driver,"Ha... how much are you charging?
"
13,9,Yates,"Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra.
"
13,9,Driver,"Aww- get in. 
"
13,9,Yates,"Right here's good, sexy.  Now if you wouldn't mind handing over the twenty dollars for oral sex.
"
13,9,Driver,"Ok-okay. 
"
13,9,Yates,"All right, buddy!... Go ahead and unbutton your pants.  All right! Here we go. 
"
13,9,Driver,"Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick.
"
13,9,Yates,"Oh that's all right.  Nothing wrong with a-FREEZE!  You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
"
13,9,Driver,"Awhuh! What?!
"
13,9,Yates,"This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you're going to jail for soliciting prostitution.  Got our first one, boys. I'm bringing him in for booking.
"
13,9,Kyle,"Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
"
13,9,Stan,"Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
"
13,9,Kenny,"(Stacey Anderson?) 
"
13,9,Butters,"Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
"
13,9,Stan,"Butters, you're the one doing all this?
"
13,9,Butters,"Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 
"
13,9,Cartman,"Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
"
13,9,Butters,"I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
"
13,9,Kyle,"You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 
"
13,9,Butters,"...A pimp. Huh...
"
13,9,Butters,"Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. ""The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'"" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 
"
13,9,Sally,"Oh. 
"
13,9,Butters,"Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
"
13,9,Butters,"Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
"
13,9,Bishop,"You? You be pimpin?
"
13,9,Butters,"Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
"
13,9,Bishop,"Now see, you think you're a pimp, but you can't be pimpin', know what I'm sayin'? You wanna be a pimp, then you gotta learn the game. See it's all about knowin' the game.
"
13,9,Butters,"What's the game?
"
13,9,Bishop,"The game is how you treat the bitches, know what I'm sayin'? Bitch gotta know when she out there, she makin' yo' muthafuckin' money, know what I'm sayin'? You got yo' main bitch, know what I'm sayin'? That be your ""bottom bitch."" That bitch rank higha than all the other bitches but she still a bitch, know what I'm sayin'?
"
13,9,Butters,"Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
"
13,9,Pimp 2,"See it's all about mind control. You gotta act a punk. Any man can control a bitch's heart, but a pimp gotta control a bitch's mind, know what I'm sayin'?
"
13,9,Butters,"I know what you're saying.
"
13,9,Pimp 2,"Pimp gotta be out there every motherfuckin' day keepin' his bitches in line. Can't let 'em go shoppin', spendin' their money on stupid shit. Bitches gotta think that's your motherfuckin money, know what I'm sayin'?
"
13,9,Butters,"Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
"
13,9,Stephen,"There you are, Butters!
"
13,9,Butters,"Hey Dad!
"
13,9,Stephen,"Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend?  Sally Darson?
"
13,9,Butters,"Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 
"
13,9,Driver 2,"I've got to tell you I... I don't do this kind of thing very often. You're sure you're not a cop, right?
"
13,9,Yates,"No way! Let's just get to this, baby.
"
13,9,Driver 2,"Alright.
"
13,9,Yates,"So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?
"
13,9,Driver 2,"Sure, I have the money right here.
"
13,9,Murphy,"Remember, he's going to give us the code word to move in. Wait for the code word, ""stretch.""
"
13,9,Officer,"Code word is ""stretch,"" copy?
"
13,9,Yates,"Oh yeah, yeah, get those pants down.
"
13,9,Driver 2,"Oh, you feel good.
"
13,9,Yates,"Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are.
"
13,9,Driver 2,"Oh yes. That's great. 
"
13,9,Yates,"Yeah, you like it?
"
13,9,Driver 2,"Oh, I love it!
"
13,9,Yates,"Yeah, you're a dirty fuck!
"
13,9,Yates,"Yeah, come on! Harder! Deeper!
"
13,9,Driver 2,"Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!
"
13,9,Yates,"Yeah, teach me a lesson, daddy!
"
13,9,Yates,"Teach this little whore a lesson!
"
13,9,Driver 2,"Yeah! Yeah!
"
13,9,Yates,"Yeah, that's right!
"
13,9,Driver 2,"Awww, awwwww, awwwwoh!  Awh.  Oh, oh man!  Thank you! That was great.
"
13,9,Yates,"Yeah, you really worked it, Daddy. You really gave my little hole quite a...  STRETCH.
"
13,9,Murphy,"Uhhh, that, that's it. Move in! 
"
13,9,Driver 2,"Oh God! It's the police!
"
13,9,Yates,"Freeze!  You are under arrest for soliciting prostitution! Book him, boys! 
"
13,9,Driver 2,"Please! Please don't do this! I have a wife and kids!
"
13,9,Yates,"A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street.
"
13,9,Groundskeeper,"That's it recess is over back to class.
"
13,9,Kids,"Aaaaaaah.
"
13,9,Butters,"Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
"
13,9,Ashley,"So wait, you're keeping all the money now?
"
13,9,Butters,"I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?
"
13,9,Mr. Garrison,"Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.
"
13,9,Butters,"Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.
"
13,9,Bebe,"What?
"
13,9,Butters,"Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?
"
13,9,Bebe,"What?!
"
13,9,Butters,"Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
"
13,9,Bebe,"Shut up!
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
"
13,9,Wendy,"Leave me alone.
"
13,9,Butters,"Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
"
13,9,Stan,"Butters. Dude!
"
13,9,Butters,"What?
"
13,9,Stan,"You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
"
13,9,Wendy,"Stan!
"
13,9,Stan,"Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
"
13,9,Butters,"Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
"
13,9,Clyde,"Wow wee. 
"
13,9,Cartman,"Dude, we've created a monster.
"
13,9,Butters,"Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
"
13,9,Mr. Garrison,"Butters! Butters, do you have a problem?!
"
13,9,Butters,"All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
"
13,9,Butters,"Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 
"
13,9,Kyle,"Butters, I really think we should talk.
"
13,9,Butters,"Sure, Kyle.
"
13,9,Kyle,"Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
"
13,9,Butters,"Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
"
13,9,Kyle,"Butters, what's happened to you?
"
13,9,Butters,"What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 
"
13,9,Frat Boy 1,"Alpha Tau Omega, woo!
"
13,9,Frat Boy 2,"ATOs!
"
13,9,Frat Boy 3,"Alright, ATOs, our little Kevin is twenty one today!  And so, Kevin, we would like to welcome you to manhood. Our gift to you. 
"
13,9,Frat Boys,"Eewwww!
"
13,9,Singer,"Suckin' on my titties like you wanted me,
Calling me all the time like Blondie.
Check out my Chrissie behind,
It's fine all of the time.
Like sex on the beaches,
What else is in the teaches of peaches?
Huh, what?
"
13,9,Yates,"Give it to me! Come on, you sissies, I can fit more of ya!  Yeah, you like your little stripper whore?! You like her?! FREEZE!  Take them all to the station, for oral and anal sex with a prostitute! Half of them didn't even use a condom!  Don't you stupid kids know the diseases you can catch?! Hand me that evidence bag. 
"
13,9,Murphy,"Sir, sssome of us are wwwondering if maybe y-you're not... taking this role a bit far?
"
13,9,Yates,"What?! No way! Nothing is more important than keeping prostitution out of our community!  Oh, hold on, that's my daddy.  Hey Daddy.
"
13,9,Bishop,"Where you at, bitch? I need my bottom bitch right now.
"
13,9,Yates,"Ye-yes, Daddy, I'm on my way.
"
13,9,Bishop,"I made you my bottom bitch, now you gotta take care of yo' pimp, know what I'm sayin'?
"
13,9,Yates,"Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now. 
"
13,9,Black Bitch,"Damn bitch! Yo' pimp beat yo' ass again?
"
13,9,White Bitch,"He's an asshole.
"
13,9,Black Bitch,"You know, I heard a rumor about some new pimp up in Park County. They say he's real respectful; lots of girls switching over to him.
"
13,9,White Bitch,"A pimp that respects his hos? Sign my ass up. 
"
13,9,Butters,"And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 
"
13,9,Charise,"Did I do good, Daddy?
"
13,9,Butters,"REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.
"
13,9,Charise,"Thank you, Daddy. 
"
13,9,Butters,"Mmmwhoa boy!
"
13,9,Butters,"And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
"
13,9,Receptionist,"And exactly what kind of business are you running?
"
13,9,Butters,"It's a kissing company.
"
13,9,Receptionist,"And you're making a profit?
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
"
13,9,Receptionist,"Do you keep any record of the men getting these ""kisses""?
"
13,9,Butters,"'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
"
13,9,Receptionist,"Senator Morris?
"
13,9,Butters,"Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
"
13,9,Receptionist,"Where?
"
13,9,Butters,"In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
"
13,9,Receptionist,"Alright, get out of here! 
"
13,9,Butters,"Huh? Why?
"
13,9,Receptionist,"I'm not falling for it!
"
13,9,Butters,"But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
"
13,9,Receptionist,"We aren't giving you anything; get out! 
"
13,9,Boss,"Mrs. Davis, is there some kind of problem?
"
13,9,Receptionist,"Eh no sir.
"
13,9,Butters,"Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 
"
13,9,Butters,"Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
"
13,9,Sally,"Okay.
"
13,9,Charise,"Ubup. Daddy, how come this ho get to be bottom bitch?
"
13,9,Sally,"What?
"
13,9,Charise,"I make the most money for you Daddy, that means if anyone should be bottom bitch, it's me.
"
13,9,Sally,"Hey, screw off, ho.
"
13,9,Charise,"Fair is fair, ho.
"
13,9,Butters,"Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!
"
13,9,Yates,"Excuse me!  Well well well, this must be the organization I've been hearing so much about. Took me a long time to find you. You won't believe the hardships I've been through trying to track you down. My name is Yolanda. I'd like to know all about your operation here. You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
"
13,9,Yates,"Well, I think that's about all I need to hear.
"
13,9,Bishop,"Yolanda!  Yolanda!
"
13,9,Butters,"What's that?
"
13,9,Bishop,"Yolanda please! You gotta come back to me! I got nothin' without you!
"
13,9,Yates,"You've got a lot of nerve coming here, Keshawn! After the way you treated me? I need a pimp that doesn't beat me every time he gets drunk!
"
13,9,Bishop,"Yolanda, I looove you. I need you. Not as my bottom bitch. I want...  I want to marry you. 
"
13,9,Yates,"It's too late for that, Keshawn! I just told this pimp I was his bitch now.
"
13,9,Butters,"Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
"
13,9,Bishop,"Thanks, pimp. You done changed the game, that's what you did.  Marry me Yolanda? We'll move to a little château in Switzerland and get away from all this.
"
13,9,Yates,"Oh Keshawn! 
"
13,9,Butters,"Wha? Awww.
"
13,9,Bishop,"I love you so much.
"
13,9,Yates,"Babe, I love you too.
"
13,9,Bishop,"So much, baby.
"
13,9,Yates,"Let's, uh, let's just be happy okay?
"
13,9,Bishop,"Promise, babe. Promise.
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh, oh.  Oh jeez. 
"
13,9,Butters,"Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
"
13,9,Bishop,"Happy anniversary baby.  Do you like 'em?
"
13,9,Yates,"I love 'em, darling.
"
13,9,Bishop,"I wanted to get you something extra-special.
"
13,9,Yates,"Well hold on. I've got something for you too, my love. I just put it right over here by the...  FREEZE!! Ha! You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
"
13,10,John Cena,"Say that again, Edge! You think you're better than me?!
"
13,10,Edge,"Cena, your mouth has gotten you in trouble for the last time! I'm gonna shut it up for you!
"
13,10,Spectators,"Oooooooooooooooooooooo!
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"Bust him up, Edge!
"
13,10,Obese Woman,"Kick his ass! WOO!
"
13,10,John Cena,"Oh yeah?! I've got somethin' else to tell you, Edge! I slept with Vanessa last night. 
"
13,10,Redneck 1,"Cena slept with Edge's girlfriend?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!
"
13,10,Stan,"I'm having the best time!
"
13,10,Edge,"You cheated, and took my belt from me, and now I can't hardly get work wrestling! You took muh girl AND you took my job! 
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"He took his job!
"
13,10,Redneck 2,"He took his jrrr?
"
13,10,Redneck 3,"Took hid drrr! 
"
13,10,Cartman,"Oh, sweet! 
"
13,10,Edge,"Whoa... 
"
13,10,Butters,"Yes! Yehhehehes!
"
13,10,Cartman,"This is awesome!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Dude! That was so badass!
"
13,10,Kyle,"Wrestling is awesome!
"
13,10,Stan,"This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 
"
13,10,Cartman,"The fuck is this?!
"
13,10,Stan,"Why did they have us put on long underwear.
"
13,10,Kyle,"Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
"
13,10,Butters,"Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.
"
13,10,Kyle,"Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
"
13,10,Cartman,"I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
"
13,10,Coach,"Alright boys! I'm really glad to see we have some new recruits interested in the fine sport of wrassling.
"
13,10,Kyle,"Cool!
"
13,10,Stan,"Yeah!
"
13,10,Butters,"Let's do this!
"
13,10,Cartman,"All right!
"
13,10,Coach,"Now, the first thing we're gonna learn today are the fundamental wrassling holds. Let's get some volunteers. Uh why don't come over here young man? What's your name?
"
13,10,Cartman,"The Rad Russian.
"
13,10,Coach,"What?
"
13,10,Cartman,"You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
"
13,10,Coach,"Okay uh, just go ahead and get on your hands and knees.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Huh?
"
13,10,Coach,"Just, down on, down on the floor.  Hands and knees. 
"
13,10,Cartman,"Okay...
"
13,10,Coach,"Alright and now how about you. Your name is?
"
13,10,Butters,"Triceratops!
"
13,10,Coach,"Uh, all right, uh cu, come on over here. I'm gonna position you in the official wrassling starting position.  Here- we- go.
"
13,10,Cartman,"The fuck is this?!
"
13,10,Coach,"Now just reach around him here. Good.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!
"
13,10,Coach,"Get back on the floor! I'm teaching the starting position of wrassling!
"
13,10,Cartman,"That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
"
13,10,Stan,"Yeah, what are you? A child molester?
"
13,10,Kyle,"Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
"
13,10,Coach,"Oh, not this again! Let me guess: you just went to that stupid WWE show in Denver last night!
"
13,10,The Boys,"Yeah! 
"
13,10,Coach,"Ugh.  The WWE is not wrassling! That's a bunch of fake bullcrap! How stupid are you! Real wrassling, boys, is this! 
"
13,10,Cartman,"Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. 
"
13,10,Stan,"Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
"
13,10,Butters,"I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 
"
13,10,Coach,"Rrrgh!
"
13,10,Cartman,"The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say ""You slept with my girlfriend,"" and I'll charge you into a head slap.
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Sounds good.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like ""No no, the fight hasn't started yet,"" and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
"
13,10,Butters,"Okey doke.
"
13,10,Jimmy,"So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Noo, let's save the ""girlfriend is a whore"" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
"
13,10,Butters,"Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
"
13,10,Stan,"Yup.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Alright, let's start wrestlin'. 
"
13,10,Jimmy,"I am gonna k-kick your ass!
"
13,10,Cartman,"You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! 
"
13,10,Butters,"Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Your girlfriend is a whore!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Wait for it, wait for the whore line.
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Oh, I'm sorry.
"
13,10,Token,"You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw!
"
13,10,Stan,"We'll see about that!
"
13,10,Butters,"Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
"
13,10,Redneck 4,"What's goin' on?
"
13,10,Redneck 5,"Apparently that crippled kid slept with that Russian kid's girlfriend.
"
13,10,Redneck 4,"Jeez they're so young.
"
13,10,Kyle,"I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
"
13,10,Butters,"That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!
"
13,10,Stan,"You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
"
13,10,Cartman,"And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
"
13,10,Stan,"I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
"
13,10,Redneck 6,"That kid was in 'Nam? Man, that's incredible!
"
13,10,Redneck 7,"Good for you for serving your country!
"
13,10,Redneck 8,"Guys, check this out! There's this little kid from the Congo, who was raised by panthers!
"
13,10,Redneck 9,"Are you serious?
"
13,10,Kyle,"Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
"
13,10,Token,"I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!
"
13,10,Redneck 10,"That kid in the hat is havin' sex with two different girls?
"
13,10,Redneck 11,"Naw, that little kid from the Congo lied about one of them to try and get the kid in the hat in trouble with his wife.
"
13,10,Redneck 12,"They're married?
"
13,10,Jimmy,"You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back
"
13,10,Cartman,"I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
"
13,10,Redneck 9,"That Russian kid's got hepatitis?
"
13,10,Announcer,"And here he comes now, the cold-blooded wrestler from Mexico, El Pollo Loco! 
"
13,10,Jimmy,"What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?
"
13,10,Kenny,"(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)
"
13,10,Kyle,"Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
"
13,10,Stan,"You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
"
13,10,Kyle,"If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
"
13,10,Announcer,"Uh oh, here she comes now! It's Bad Irene! 
"
13,10,Cartman,"Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
"
13,10,Stan,"What?!
"
13,10,Redneck 13,"No! No! What are you doing?! Stan the Man loves you!
"
13,10,Redneck 14,"Don't break his heart!
"
13,10,Stan,"If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
"
13,10,Cartman,"It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. 
"
13,10,Kyle,"Irene, no! Why?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
"
13,10,Redneck 15,"Whoa, did you hear that?
"
13,10,Redneck 16,"Shh!
"
13,10,Stan,"Irene, you said you loved me!
"
13,10,Cartman,"I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! 
"
13,10,Spectators,"Ohhhh!  Ahhhh!
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"I'm telling you guys, you've got to see this. These kids ain't more than eight or nine years old an' they got more problems than you can imagine.
"
13,10,Redneck 13,"There's this one kid, he saw his father get murdered. And yesterday he finds the killer, and it's this other kid whose an ex-cop. Needless to say, he whupped his ass good.
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"Yup, and there's this little girl, she's actually addicted to gettin' abortions. Got pregnant by nearly every boy there.
"
13,10,Redneck 17,"You're shittin' me!
"
13,10,Redneck 13,"No! We're telling you these kids are fucking crazy! You gotta check it out! 
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"You can watch 'em almost every afternoon. It's some of the greatest wrestlin' we ever seen.
"
13,10,Coach,"It isn't real! Don't you people understand that stuff isn't real?! None of it! How stupid are you?! 
"
13,10,Redneck 13,"What do you mean, it ain't real?
"
13,10,Coach,"It's all made up! Fiction! Real wrassling is a serious and respectable sport! Why can't you people understand that that kind of wrestling isn't real?!
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"Mister, there's a little girl out there who's had fourteen abortions, an' she ain't even ten yet. But I guess that's just  ""not real"" to you!  Son of a bitch.
"
13,10,Coach,"Look look look!  THIS is wrestling. THIS. 
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"Mister, you'd better take your gay porn an' walk right out of this bar.
"
13,10,Stan,"Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
"
13,10,Kyle,"Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
"
13,10,Butters,"Yeah!
"
13,10,Kyle,"Let's do this! One! Two!
"
13,10,Boys,"Backyard wrestling!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.
"
13,10,Stan,"Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
"
13,10,Redneck 13,"Gee, I didn't know his parents did that.
"
13,10,Redneck 18,"Shhh.
"
13,10,Principal Victoria,"I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.
"
13,10,Coach,"You're firing me? Why?!
"
13,10,Principal Victoria,"The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. 
"
13,10,Coach,"No, this isn't wrassling! THIS ISN'T WRASSLING! Principal Victoria, just let me stay on and I can teach kids what real wrassling is!
"
13,10,Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.
"
13,10,Coach,"You can't fire me for what these kids do!
"
13,10,Principal Victoria,"That isn't the only reason you're being let go.
"
13,10,Coach,"What do you mean?
"
13,10,Principal Victoria,"We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors.
"
13,10,Kyle,"So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
"
13,10,Token,"Oh! Sure, that works.
"
13,10,Cartman,"You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!
"
13,10,Kyle,"What dude? 
"
13,10,Cartman,"We just received a letter from the WWE.
"
13,10,Stan,"From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
"
13,10,Butters,"No way!
"
13,10,Cartman,"""Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth.""
"
13,10,Stan,"Vince McMahon is coming to see us?
"
13,10,Kyle,"This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 
"
13,10,Stan,"Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
"
13,10,Kyle,"Oh my God... Oh my God...
"
13,10,Token,"I can't believe it's him.
"
13,10,Butters,"I'm freaking out...
"
13,10,Kyle,"Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
"
13,10,Stan,"Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"Yeah, no I I think Congo is a great wrestler; I just think Rad Russian has his number.
"
13,10,Redneck 19,"Yeah, but Rad Russian has a lot of abandonment issues. 
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"Uh oh, it looks like the intermission is over, better head back.
"
13,10,Kyle,"I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 
"
13,10,Stan,"Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 
"
13,10,Butters,"Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
"
13,10,Kyle,"I'll fight anytime, anywhere!
"
13,10,Redneck 20,"He don't run from fights, just from responsibilities. 
"
13,10,Crowd,"Oohhhhh!  Boooooooo!
"
13,10,Stan,"What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. 
"
13,10,Announcer,"It's El Pollo Loco! 
"
13,10,Cartman,"Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
"
13,10,Kyle,"Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
"
13,10,Kenny,"(Yeah, we've been talking.)
"
13,10,Cartman,"And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
"
13,10,Stan,"Yeah?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.
"
13,10,Kenny,"(Yep.)
"
13,10,Kyle,"What are you talking about?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!
"
13,10,Stan,"He's right.
"
13,10,Kyle,"What?
"
13,10,Stan,"Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Right?
"
13,10,Stan,"And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
"
13,10,Kyle,"Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
"
13,10,Cartman,"No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.
"
13,10,Kenny,"(They're gonna hurt our chances.)
"
13,10,Cartman,"Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
"
13,10,Kyle,"So what do we do?
"
13,10,Kenny,"(We've gotta bring somebody else on.)
"
13,10,Cartman,"Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
"
13,10,Stan,"Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
"
13,10,Kyle,"How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
"
13,10,Cartman,"It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!
"
13,10,Number 17,"You dirty Muslim bastard! I don't trust you, and I never will! Do you know how it feels to lose your parents?! No you wouldn't, you smelly brown Middle Eastern piece of sh-
"
13,10,Cartman,"Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!
"
13,10,Number 24,"Your father! Your own father!  I don't care if you were on drugs, you sick! Whore!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Thank you. 
"
13,10,Kyle,"That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
"
13,10,Kenny,"(Mhm.)
"
13,10,Stan,"Yeah yeah, not bad.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?
"
13,10,Number 37,"Not a whole lot to tell, really. Was born in Fort Collins, started watching wrestling when I was four years old. My father... he liked it too. Until he died.  Sometimes I think it's 'cause of him I followed this dream. 
All my life, all I ever wanted was to
Beeeee a wrestler
Fiiiiighting in the ring
Winning that belt.
And so I dreamed every night that I was the
Uuuuundertaaker
Smaaaaashing skulls in
Breaking arms.
But I'm so worked up. This is something I can do.
Do I have what it takes inside?
"
13,10,Stan,"Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Yeah, this guy crushes.
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"It isn't fair. All my hard work.  I'm not going to take it anymore.  That wrestling show is in for a big surprise.  I'm putting an end to this once and for all!  Hyaaaaa!
"
13,10,Kyle,"He's here! Vince McMahon is here! 
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Oowow, it's really him.
"
13,10,Stan,"He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
"
13,10,Cartman,"Alright, places everyone.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. 
"
13,10,Stan,"Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?
"
13,10,Kyle,"You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
"
13,10,Stan,"Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
"
13,10,Kyle,"Wait a minute. Who is that?
"
13,10,Stan,"It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. 
"
13,10,Kyle,"You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!
"
13,10,Cartman,"My man can do whatever he wants.
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"Stay calm, you know what you have to do.
"
13,10,Cartman,"You're just gonna have to deal with that.
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"For the good of real wrassling. 
"
13,10,Butters,"No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
"
13,10,Cartman,"My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
"
13,10,Stan,"No, you can't possibly mean that-!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
"
13,10,Crowd,"Awwwww!
"
13,10,Butters,"There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
"
13,10,Number 37,"Mother! Why did you abort me? Why?
"
13,10,Redneck 21,"He's alive!
"
13,10,Cartman,"You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
"
13,10,Assistant,"What do you thnk?
"
13,10,Stan,"Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.
"
13,10,Vince,"They are decent wrestlers. We'll see how they develop their through lines in the second act. 
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!
"
13,10,Butters,"Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
"
13,10,Guard,"Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm afraid this area is off limits
"
13,10,Butters,"Are you sure?
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"Oh don't mind me.  I was just about to- 
"
13,10,Guard,"Heh whoa-ho! Heh hey! Whoawhoawhoa. Whoahoho. Eheheh. The fuck is this?
"
13,10,Cartman,"O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
"
13,10,Stan,"When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
"
13,10,Butters,"He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Lies! These are all a bunch of lies!  Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!
"
13,10,Kenny,"(I can keep the baby...)
"
13,10,Cartman,"Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"Only one shot.  Maximum damage.  This is all your fault, you WWE president asshole! Your fault we all die here. Right. Now. FOR WRASSLING!  NO! 
"
13,10,Fan 1,"O dios mio, mataron al Pollo Loco!
"
13,10,Fan 2,"Bastardos! 
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"No! No, shut up!  You idiots want wrassling?! This is wrassling! 
"
13,10,Redneck 22,"We want some real wrestlers!
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"This is just a bunch of garbage! And you are all ruining the good name of wrassling!  Wrassling is from ancient Greece! It's in the Olympics!
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"What the hell do you care?! Get off the wrestlin' mat! Boo!
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"Why do I care? These kids made it so real wrassling is gone from schools! It's practically gone from the culture. Damn it they took my job!
"
13,10,Crowd,"Huh? What?
"
13,10,Redneck 5,"They took his job.
"
13,10,Redneck 23,"I know. Sshh. 
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"You want to know pain? Pain is dedicating your entire life to a sport, to a career, and then having it all ripped away from you like a babe from its mother.
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"Oh man, they took his job?
"
13,10,Redneck 13,"They took hid-drr.
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"Lost everything! Couldn't even afford to pay for my... little retriever Rex anymore! Animal Control came and got him!
"
13,10,Redneck 24,"They took his dog!
"
13,10,Redneck 25,"They tok hid-drr!
"
13,10,Redneck 5,"Took hid-drrr!
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"I ended up on the streets, stealing! Got busted by the police and had to spent the night in jail! The other inmates, they all beat me and fractured my jaw to where I couldn't eat!
"
13,10,Redneck 26,"They broke his jaw!
"
13,10,Redneck 22,"Theeyy broke his jaw!
"
13,10,Redneck 27,"Brk hij-jrr! 
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"So you see I have nothing left. Nothing! Not even the will to live. 
"
13,10,Vince,"Sir, that was one of the finest wrestling performances I have ever seen.
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"What?
"
13,10,Vince,"Will you not join our wrestling organization? I promise to make you our leading act.
"
13,10,Coach Connors,"You, you mean it?
"
13,10,Vince,"Come! I want to get you in rehearsals right away! 
"
13,10,Kyle,"What?
"
13,10,Stan,"Dude.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Hey, what about us? Our show? 
"
13,10,Vince,"Sorry boys. You are decent wrestlers, but lack the raw wrestling talent this man has.
"
13,10,The Boys,"Aaaaah.
"
13,10,Cartman,"This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
"
13,10,Kyle,"Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!
"
13,10,Stan,"What?? 
"
13,10,Jimmy,"You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!
"
13,10,Stan,"Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... 
"
13,10,Redneck 28,"What the hell's this?
"
13,10,Redneck 29,"This is Goddamned fake!
"
13,10,Darryl Weathers,"Screw this, this is just stupid. 
"
13,10,Cartman,"Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!
"
13,10,Redneck 30,"FAKE!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Kenny! I'm-
"
13,11,Trainer 1,"All right, everyone, welcome to the Dolphin Encounter here at the Denver Aquarium.  My name is Chet and I'll be your guide and trainer as you meet these intelligent and truly magical creatures.  And here they come: this is Trigger and Dolly, uh there's Bubbles
"
13,11,Stan,"Wow cool.
"
13,11,Randy,"Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?
"
13,11,Stan,"Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
"
13,11,Chet,"If they come near you you can touch their back just no grabbing please. What whimsical creatures aren't they? All the dolphins you will be encountering today are Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Now who would like to get a kiss from one?
"
13,11,Girl,"I would like to-
"
13,11,Randy,"MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!
"
13,11,Trainer 1,"Uh all right, let's just uh, get you to put your hands, palms down, on the water.  The- 
"
13,11,Stan,"What the hell is that? 
"
13,11,Trainer 2,"Oh no it's the Japanese! 
"
13,11,Japanese Man 1,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck youuu dofiiin!
"
13,11,Japanese Man 2,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you dofiiin! 
"
13,11,Guide,"These are our favorite animals here at the Atlanta Zoo. It's Dolly and Seymour. They are beluga whales. These whales live mostly in the Arctic region- 
"
13,11,Japanese Man 3,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, whaaales!
"
13,11,Trainer 3,"All right Jessica, now put your arms down like this.  Great job, Jessica!
"
13,11,Japanese Man 4,"Fuck you, whaaale! 
"
13,11,Trainer 3,"AAAAAAAA!
"
13,11,Randy,"Hey pal.  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.
"
13,11,Stan,"Dad, why did they do that?
"
13,11,Randy,"Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   And you always have your neat picture. 
"
13,11,Commentator 1,"Dan Dierdorf here, welcoming you to this great football matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins. We're all set for kickoff and- 
"
13,11,Commentator 2,"Oh Dan it looks like Japanese people are now rushing onto the field.  This is not the kind of thing you want happening during kickoff. 
"
13,11,Japanese Man 5,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, dofiiin!
"
13,11,News Anchor,"Several whales and dolphins were again slaughtered by the Japanese today, this time at the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom near San Francisco.  Aquariums had been experimenting with methods to keep the Japanese out, but so far nothing seems to stop them. When asked if all of Japan supported the slaughtering of whales and dolphins, the current Prime Minister of Japan, Yukio Hatoyama, had this to say
"
13,11,Hatoyama,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you weiru , anda fuck you dohfiiin! 
"
13,11,Cartman,"Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh.
"
13,11,Stan,"Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.
"
13,11,Cartman,"What do you mean? This song is sweet.
"
13,11,Stan,"No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
"
13,11,Kyle,"Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
"
13,11,Stan,"So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?
"
13,11,Kyle,"What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
"
13,11,Stan,"It seems like everyone has an attitude of ""that's just the way they are"" or ""that's just the way it is""! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
"
13,11,Cartman,"I'm not too busy, Stan.
"
13,11,Stan,"You're not?
"
13,11,Cartman,"No, I just don't care. At all.
"
13,11,Kenny,"(Yeah, me neither.)
"
13,11,Stan,"Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
"
13,11,Cartman,"Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!
"
13,11,Stan,"You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 
"
13,11,Cartman,"I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.
"
13,11,Butters,"Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
"
13,11,Stan,"Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?
"
13,11,Butters,"Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
"
13,11,Stan,"Really?  People who are doing something?
"
13,11,Butters,"I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
"
13,11,Stan,"Then that's where I belong.
"
13,11,Singer,"The world is a vampire, sent to drain.
"
13,11,Captain Paul Watson,"Yeah, we're badass.
"
13,11,Singer,"Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
"
13,11,Male Crew 1,"Any means necessary! We're not protesters, we're pirates! 
"
13,11,Captain,"That's definitely a Japanese boat.  Looks like they're whaling now. 
"
13,11,Japanese Sailor,"Fuck youuu, weiruu!
"
13,11,First Mate,"Oh my God, they're gonna kill those humpbacks!
"
13,11,Woman,"We've gotta do something!
"
13,11,Captain,"Pull up next to them. The fight is on!
"
13,11,Stan,"Sweet! 
"
13,11,Captain,"Are we ready to do this?
"
13,11,Crew,"Yeah!
"
13,11,Stan,"Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!
"
13,11,Captain,"Are we badasses?
"
13,11,"Crew, Stan","Yeah!
"
13,11,Captain,"Are we badasses?
"
13,11,"Crew, Stan","Yeah!
"
13,11,Captain,"All right, so... what do we do?  Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media they did it?
"
13,11,Crewman,"Great idea, Captain!
"
13,11,Aussie Crewman,"I'll start right now. 
"
13,11,Woman,"""Oy my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales.""
"
13,11,Captain,"Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis?
"
13,11,Stan,"Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
"
13,11,Captain,"Why not?
"
13,11,Stan,"Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
"
13,11,Captain,"You know what? He's right. It's time to bring out the big guns! You guys ready?  Ready? And... throw the stinky butter at them! 
"
13,11,Luke,"Haha, you stink now! Haha!
"
13,11,Stan,"Wait, that's it?
"
13,11,Captain,"Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one.
"
13,11,Stan,"Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
"
13,11,Captain,"Well no, that'd be illegal.
"
13,11,Crewman 2,"Yeah.
"
13,11,Stan,"I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
"
13,11,Woman,"I'm a pirate in a war.
"
13,11,Stan,"Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
"
13,11,Captain,"We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!
"
13,11,Luke,"The Japanese are scared of how hardcore we are. 
"
13,11,Woman,"Paul! 
"
13,11,Crewman,"Paul?
"
13,11,Crewman 2,"What do we do?
"
13,11,Woman,"We don't have a captain!
"
13,11,Crewman,"Oh my God, oh my God!
"
13,11,Woman 2,"Maybe he's okay.
"
13,11,Crewman 2,"Oh my God.
"
13,11,Luke,"What did you do?
"
13,11,Stan,"What you assholes acted like you were doing? 
"
13,11,Stan,"Wait for it... wait for it... NOW! 
"
13,11,The Japanese,"Ohhhh Gojira! Gojira! 
"
13,11,Hatoyama,"Nippon no gaijin!  Kuso, taberu na! 
"
13,11,Announcer,"And now, Larry King, live.
"
13,11,Larry King,"My guest tonight is the little boy who took over the Whale Wars reality show and turned it into a big hit. Please welcome Stan Marsh and his crew.
"
13,11,Luke,"'Ey Jordan! I'm on Larry King, mate!
"
13,11,Larry King,"So Stan, what motivated you, what... inspired you to get out there and make a hit TV show?
"
13,11,Stan,"No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.
"
13,11,Larry King,"Once you became captain the methods used to stop the Japanese definitely became more aggressive. Was that the key to help boost your ratings?
"
13,11,Stan,"...No, I don't care about the show.
"
13,11,Woman 2,"We're pirates.
"
13,11,Stan,"I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
"
13,11,Woman 2,"I've got balls! 
"
13,11,Larry King,"Well there are many people who see what you're doing as a positive thing, and of course, many that see problems with it. Joining us now is one of those people and...  You say Stan's methods are unethical.
"
13,11,Sid,"Larry, you can't just go out and take matters into your own hands like this. If you want a hit TV show you have to go through producers, directors, people that are in unions.
"
13,11,Larry King,"But Sid, you saw the show before Stan took it over; you have to admit that it was nothing but incompetent vegan pussies doing absolutely nothing and trying to turn it into drama.
"
13,11,Sid,"Yes, but it doesn't justify changing the entire show structure that their old captain had pitched to the network.
"
13,11,Stan,"Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
"
13,11,Larry King,"But their old captain, Paul Watson , was an unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was okay as long as it served his cause.
"
13,11,Sid,"He yes, of course, everyone knows that Paul Watson was a smug, narcoleptic liar with no credibility, but we must-
"
13,11,Stan,"Screw this, I gotta get back to work!
"
13,11,Announcer,"On this episode of Real Actual Whale Wars, Captain Marsh searches for the Japanese fleet, knowing they could be absolutely anywhere. 
"
13,11,Stan,"Would you mind stepping back a little?
"
13,11,Luke,"Captain! Captain, some new volunteers showed up to help us in our crusade! 
"
13,11,Stan,"No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
"
13,11,Luke,"But they say you know them. 
"
13,11,Cartman,"Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! .
"
13,11,Stan,"Oh no, no, NO.
"
13,11,Cartman,"What dude?
"
13,11,Stan,"Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
"
13,11,Cartman,"We always have.
"
13,11,Kenny,"(Yeah, totally!)
"
13,11,Stan,"I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
"
13,11,Cartman,"That's not what we said.
"
13,11,Stan,"You said ""Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!""
"
13,11,Cartman,"We were talking about Wales the country.
"
13,11,Stan,"Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!
"
13,11,Kenny,"(I just want to be on TV.)
"
13,11,Cartman,"Kenny!  I deserve to be on TV.
"
13,11,Crewman 2,"Captain! Captain, the Japanese have been spotted near buoy 24!
"
13,11,Stan,"Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
"
13,11,Cartman,"All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! 
"
13,11,Announcer,"Captain Marsh races his boat to the last known location of the Japanese whalers. If he doesn't get there in time, hundreds of dolphins or whales could die.
"
13,11,Stan,"As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! 
"
13,11,Crewman 2,"What the hell was that?!
"
13,11,Crewman 3,"We just got rammed.
"
13,11,Stan,"Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
"
13,11,Crewman 4,"It's not the Japanese.
"
13,11,Stan,"What? 
"
13,11,Announcer,"On deck the crew is surprised at what they see. The other boat is from Deadliest Catch, a crab-fishing reality show.
"
13,11,DC Captain,"You think you're so cool, don'tcha?! You think you're big boat reality show on the block?!  You're taking away men's livelihoods!
"
13,11,Stan,"What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
"
13,11,DC Captain,"You're taking viewers away from our show, you stupid ass!
"
13,11,Cartman,"Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!
"
13,11,DC Crewman,"Your show is fuckin' gay!
"
13,11,Stan,"Screw this! Turn hard to port! 
"
13,11,Announcer,"But everywhere his reality show's boat turns, the crab fishing reality boat block its path. 
"
13,11,Stan,"Dude, fuck you!
"
13,11,DC Captain,"Fuck you!
"
13,11,Announcer,"It's been three hours and the crab fishing reality show isn't budging.  Captain Marsh's boat is dead in the water. He can't go after the Japanese, he can't help the whales or dolphins. Once again on Whale Wars, nothing is happening.
"
13,11,Crewman 3,"It's pretty difficult times because uh, we know that every minute we're sitting here stopped, a, another whale is dying.
"
13,11,Cartman,"Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.
"
13,11,Kenny,"(And they're all shot.) 
"
13,11,Cartman,"Shhh, Kenny...  Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he-  Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though.  Yeah, keep it there.  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.
"
13,11,Kenny,"(I would do anything!) 
"
13,11,Announcer,"The crab-fishing reality show was doing just fine. 
"
13,11,DC Crew,"Yeah! Woohoo! Alright! 
"
13,11,Announcer,"But for the Whale Wars crew, it appears the show is over. Until... a sound is heard. 
"
13,11,Stan,"What was that? 
"
13,11,Benjamin,"Captain, look!
"
13,11,The Crew,"Wow. Whoa. 
"
13,11,Woman 2,"The whales are taking out the crab fisherman reality show!
"
13,11,Stan,"It's like... they know. 
"
13,11,DC Crewmen,"Hey. Heeey. Noo! Stop! 
"
13,11,Stan,"They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
"
13,11,Cartman,"Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. 
"
13,11,Japanese Pilot,"Bonzaaaaaaaai! 
"
13,11,Stan,"Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
"
13,11,Woman 2,"Look out! 
"
13,11,Stan,"I, I can't, I can't believe it.
"
13,11,Cartman,"Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.
"
13,11,Cartman,"Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round.
"
13,11,Stan,"Will you stop that?
"
13,11,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
"
13,11,Stan,"Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
"
13,11,Cartman,"You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! 
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.
"
13,11,Guard,"Itte kure 'Akihito-sama irashaimasu!' 
"
13,11,Emperor Akihito,"So, you are the ones who have been-a sinking our boats!
"
13,11,Stan,"You speak English.
"
13,11,Emperor Akihito,"You have caused us many problems, set us back many months!
"
13,11,Cartman,"Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
"
13,11,Kenny,"(Yeah, can we go?)
"
13,11,Emperor Akihito,"Why have you done this? Why do you insist on-a making trouble for the Japanese?!
"
13,11,Stan,"Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
"
13,11,Emperor Akihito,"You think you have the right to tell us what is okay?! I have-a something to show you!
"
13,11,Emperor Akihito,"This is Hiroshima. Over fifty years ago this entire city was-a destroyed by nuclear bomb. We built this museum so that we never forget what-a happened. 
"
13,11,Cartman,"What dude?
"
13,11,Emperor Akihito,"At-a 8:15 a.m. the people of Hiroshima were just minding their own business when out of nowhere a frash devastated them all.  Women and children who died in the frash simply evaporated.  Those reft arrive suffered the worst pain of all. Burns, radiation poisoning. For generations the radiation affected the victims. Japanese babies born without rimbs. Without eyes! 
"
13,11,Cartman,"Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me.
"
13,11,Emperor Akihito,"One hundred and forty thousand Japanese were killed by atom bomb. We have never recovered from the memory of that day. It is impossible for a nation to ever forgive an act so horrible. This-a picture shows the prane that dropped the bomb.  It was called the Enora Gay. And it was frown by the monsters who dropped the bomb that day. Dohfin, and Weiru! 
"
13,11,Stan,"Ummm, where did you get that picture?
"
13,11,Emperor Akihito,"The Americans were nice enough to give it to us the day after the bombing. We were so-a thankful for the picture that the next day we ended our war with America. We will never forgive, never rest until they are all wiped out! Fuck you. Fuck you dohfin and-a weiru!
"
13,11,Cartman,"So that's what this has all been about?
"
13,11,Stan,"Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-
"
13,11,Cartman,"Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
"
13,11,Stan,"Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
"
13,11,Kyle,"Hello? Stan?
"
13,11,Stan,"Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
"
13,11,Stan,"Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.
"
13,11,Emperor Akihito,"Chicken and-a cow? Chicken and-a cow?!
"
13,11,Hatoyama,"Chicken and cow use poor dohfin and weiru as-a scapegoat?! This is outrage! 
"
13,11,The Japanese,"Fuck you cows!
"
13,11,The Japanese,"Teikara chickens!
"
13,11,Randy,"Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.
"
13,12,Cartman,"Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
"
13,12,Stan,"Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
"
13,12,Kyle,"This... is exactly what I needed.
"
13,12,Kenny,"(Meee toooo.) 
"
13,12,Stan,"Aww! Not those guys again! 
"
13,12,Cartman,"God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?! 
"
13,12,Stan,"God! Shut up!
"
13,12,Cartman,"Piss off, you stupid assholes! 
"
13,12,Randy,"Isn't this great food?
"
13,12,Gerald,"You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.
"
13,12,Randy,"You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-
"
13,12,Father Maxi,"On this gorgeous day we bring these two together for the most important ta- 
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Everybody's checking us out.
"
13,12,Biker 2,"Yeah, they think we're pretty cool.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Hooo! We were definitely turnin' some heads out there.
"
13,12,Biker 3,"Yeah!
"
13,12,Biker 2,"I was pullin' back on that throttle, and everybody was like, ""What is that?""
"
13,12,Biker 4,"Fer sure!
"
13,12,Biker 3,"Yeah.
"
13,12,Biker 5,"Hey- hey, nobody here is really paying attention to us.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"That's weird.  Oh yeah, that's better.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"All right let's head out. 
"
13,12,Cartman,"Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"...What did you say?
"
13,12,Cartman,"You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
"
13,12,Biker 6,"...Hey man, we roll how we roll, and if people are annoyed or intimidated by it, that's too bad for them!
"
13,12,Biker 2,"Yeah! 
"
13,12,Cartman,"No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. 
"
13,12,Biker 7,"Thah- that little boy just called us fags.
"
13,12,Biker 2,"Like he didn't think we were cool.
"
13,12,Biker 6,"But he's wrong. People don't think we're fags, do they?
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"'Course he's wrong! And anyway, nobody except that little freak would ever say something like it to our faces!
"
13,12,Other Bikers,"Yeah! Let's ride!  Let's go! Rev 'em up! 
"
13,12,Ike,"Fags! 
"
13,12,Biker 2,"Did that kid just call us-?
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Ju-just ignore him!  God damn it, this is fucked up!
"
13,12,Biker 8,"What's wrong with kids today? 
"
13,12,Biker 4,"It doesn't make any sense. They all called us fags.
"
13,12,Biker 6,"How can they call us fags? I mean, listen to this? 
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"I know, I know! Look, guys, I think I know what the problem is here.
"
13,12,Biker 3,"Really? You do?
"
13,12,Biker 9,"Whatwhat?
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Yeah, think about it, guys. You see all the things kids have today? I mean, with their Xboxes and surround-sound entertainment systems, kids today are surrounded by big loud stuff all the time!
"
13,12,Biker 10,"Hey, that's right.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"That's all it is, guys. We just need to get a little louder, that's all. 
"
13,12,Kyle,"Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
"
13,12,Cartman,"But Cartman isn't letting up on him. 
"
13,12,Kyle,"Oh, what the hell?! 
"
13,12,Biker 6,"Chicken spears! Chicken spears! Chicken spears! ...Chicken spears! Chicken spears!
"
13,12,Stan,"God damn it God damn it!
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Oh yeah, now we're turnin' some heads! 
"
13,12,Biker 2,"Let's see 'em call us fags now!
"
13,12,Stan,"All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
"
13,12,Kyle,"Yes.
"
13,12,Cartman,"Agreed.
"
13,12,Jimmy,"I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots.
"
13,12,Stan,"Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
"
13,12,Kyle,"Sounds good.
"
13,12,Token,"Okay good, yeah.
"
13,12,Cartman,"Ni-nice, okay.
"
13,12,Butters,"What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
"
13,12,Cartman,"What?
"
13,12,Butters,"I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! ""Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!"" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
"
13,12,Stan,"...That makes perfect sense, Butters.
"
13,12,Butters,"It does?
"
13,12,Stan,"Yes, now get out of here.
"
13,12,Butters,"Okay. 
"
13,12,Stan,"Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
"
13,12,Cartman,"I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
"
13,12,Stan,"Oh that's good.
"
13,12,Cartman,"Yeah, I think that'll be nice.
"
13,12,Stan,"But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
"
13,12,Cartman,"I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
"
13,12,Stan,"Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
"
13,12,All,"Yeah!
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Now that was a good breakfast.
"
13,12,Biker 6,"I'm full. 
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"You guys smell that? Smells like that new famous bowl at KFC
"
13,12,Biker 6,"Ohh, OHHH! Somebody took a shit on mah fuckin' Harley!
"
13,12,Biker 3,"What?
"
13,12,Biker 2,"Awwww, me too! I got shit all over my pants now! 
"
13,12,Biker 7,"There's a little flag stuck in the shit!
"
13,12,Biker 11,"""You're fags."" You've gotta be kidding me!
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Come on, we'll find the bastards who did this! 
"
13,12,Biker 12,"This can't be happening. 
"
13,12,Stan,"Really nice work, guys.
"
13,12,Kyle,"Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
"
13,12,Big Gay Al,"And so I said to the guy, ""you really think I'm paying that much?""
"
13,12,Mr. Slave,"Heheh, oh Jesus Christ. 
"
13,12,Big Gay Al,"Oh my God. I thought we were past this.
"
13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, ""Fags get out."" Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-
"
13,12,Cartman,"That was us!
"
13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"...'Scuse me?
"
13,12,Stan,"Yeah, we did that!
"
13,12,"Kyle, Kenny","Yeah!
"
13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!
"
13,12,Kyle,"W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.
"
13,12,Cartman,"Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?
"
13,12,Other Kids,"Yeah, uh huh, I do, yep. 
"
13,12,Mr. Mackey,"Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!
"
13,12,Stan,"Gay people?
"
13,12,Kyle,"We aren't talking about gay people.
"
13,12,Mr. Mackey,"You just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town!
"
13,12,Stan,"Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
"
13,12,Cartman,"Oh, they think we meant gay fags.
"
13,12,Kyle,"Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
"
13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!
"
13,12,Stan,"Aw crap!
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Faggot, often shortened to fag, has been used in the English language since the late sixteenth century. Its original meaning was ""an old or unpleasant woman"".
"
13,12,Biker 2,"That certainly don't apply to us.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Faggot later was defined as a bundle of sticks. And in the nineteenth century, a faggot gatherer was someone who made a meager living gathering firewood.
"
13,12,Biker 6,"Well they certainly ain't calling us fags 'cause we gather sticks; there's got to be more! 
"
13,12,Biker 2,"What's that part say there?
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Later, the term ""fag"" was defined as any awkward bundle to be carried, and was often used as an insult to the elderly, as in calling them ""baggage"".
"
13,12,Biker 2,"Fag was used as an insult to women, then poor people, then old people?
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"In the early 1900s the word became a pe-jo-ra-tive term against homosexuals and transgender people in the United States.
"
13,12,Biker 10,"Well that word just keeps changing its meaning. What's it got to do with us? 
"
13,12,Judge 1,"We are really trying to understand this. How is it that you boys think referring to gay people as fags in today's world is acceptable?
"
13,12,Kyle,"Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
"
13,12,Stan,"Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.
"
13,12,Judge 2,"I happen to be gay, boys. Do you think I'm a fag?
"
13,12,Stan,"Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
"
13,12,Judge 2,"No.
"
13,12,Stan,"Then you're not a fag.
"
13,12,Judge 1,"So what if a guy is gay and rides a Harley?
"
13,12,Cartman,"Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
"
13,12,Stan,"I don't know.
"
13,12,Kenny,"(This is fucking ridiculous.)
"
13,12,Stan,"All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
"
13,12,Judge 3,"""Fag.""
"
13,12,Stan,"Right. But you're not thinkin' ""Oh, he's a homosexual,"" you're thinkin' ""Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider.""
"
13,12,Judge 1,"This, this is, making insanely good sense to me.
"
13,12,Judge 4,"Alright, how about this: What would you call a straight man who doesn't own a Harley, but likes them and might buy one someday?
"
13,12,Cartman,"You call them ""bike-curious"".
"
13,12,Judge 1,"""Bike-cu-""
"
13,12,Stan,"""Bike-curious""! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
"
13,12,Kenny,"(Jesus fucking Christ!)
"
13,12,Big Gay Al,"Fellow homosexuals, I believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind. We must acknowledge that the words ""fag"" and ""faggot"" are never going to disappear. They're simply too much fun for everyone to say. But we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet, and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot Harley riders!
"
13,12,Mr. Slave,"Hear hear!
"
13,12,Big Gay Al,"We should all be tolerant, but not with these fucking people! They really are faggots!
"
13,12,Mr. Slave,"Yeth Jethuth yeth!
"
13,12,Announcer,"This is Channel 4 Evening News.
"
13,12,News Anchor,"A new movement in South Park is bringing to question the word ""fag"". Gay groups are pointing out that the word no longer means to kids today what it meant just a few years ago.
"
13,12,Field Reporter,"And what is your name, little boy?
"
13,12,Martin,"Martin.
"
13,12,Field Reporter,"Alright Martin, can you do me a favor? Could you point to the ""fag"" for me?  Point to which one is the fag.  All right now could you just point to the fag for me, little girl? Which one is a faggot? 
"
13,12,News Anchor,"Sparked by this realization and persuaded by a gay advocate group, the Mayor signed a new city ordinance today making the word ""fag"" officially refer to annoying inconsiderate Harley riders. 
"
13,12,Field Reporter,"How do you fags feel about the new city ordinance?
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"What did you say?
"
13,12,Field Reporter,"Just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance, fag.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Hey you know what? If you call me fag in my face one more time, you'd better-
"
13,12,Field Reporter,"I already did it twice.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Well I think that- I think that you uh, you probably won't say it again.
"
13,12,Field Reporter,"I bet I do.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Well okay, I-
"
13,12,Field Reporter,"Fag. 
"
13,12,News Anchor,"As more people in South Park adapt to the new meaning... 
"
13,12,Randy,"Fags! 
"
13,12,News Anchor,"...more and more Harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere.
"
13,12,Cartman,"Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. 
"
13,12,Stan,"Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
"
13,12,Kyle,"I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
"
13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"You four turd balls in my office NOW!
"
13,12,Stan,"Aw crap! 
"
13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"You have got me in a lot of trouble! 
"
13,12,Another Mayor,"The fact of the matter is that ""fag"" is still defined in the dictionary as a pejorative term against homosexuals, and so you are still causing harm to gay people everywhere whether you mean it differently or not! The town of South Park and its mayor have once again shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the progressive world!
"
13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!
"
13,12,Kyle,"We're sorry, Mayor.
"
13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!
"
13,12,Stan,"We can fix this!
"
13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"HOW?!
"
13,12,Stan,"That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
"
13,12,Cartman,"Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Now I don't know about you, but I think this town is starting a trend. And if we let them officially change the meaning of ""fag"" from gay people to us, then soon every town might.  If we don't do anythng, we can end up trying to fight e-  If we don't do anything, we c-... Hey Bartlett. Bartlett!  I'm trying to talk, you fag!  Aw, see? Now they got us doin' it to ourselves! We gotta put a stop to this now!  We're going to ride into that town and kick some fuckin' ass! 
"
13,12,Field Reporter,"Excitement is in the air as the citizens of South Park amass to see if the word ""fag"" will officially be changed in the English dictionary. Four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor, and if they succeed, ""fag"" will officially refer to Harley riders nationwide.
"
13,12,Big Gay Al,"You can do it, boys! We believe in you!
"
13,12,Field Reporter,"And Tom, it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived.  Entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course, the dictionary's head editor, Mr. Emmanuel Lewis. 
"
13,12,Cartman,"Emmanuel Lewis, huh?
"
13,12,Stan,"Ohh, it all makes sense now. 
"
13,12,Emmanuel Lewis,"To change...  the definition of a word... is no trifling thing. I expect this proposal for changing the definition of the word ""fag"" to be both discerning and undisputable.
"
13,12,Big Gay Al,"Come on boys, you can do it! 
"
13,12,Randy,"Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! 
"
13,12,Stan,"There's fags everywhere!
"
13,12,Kyle,"We gotta run! 
"
13,12,Emmanuel Lewis,"WAAAH! What nefariousness is this?! Ogh! You obdurate beast! 
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"Well well. Now, do you think we're fags?
"
13,12,Stan,"Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. 
"
13,12,Kyle,"Yeah. You definitely made your point.
"
13,12,Biker 13,"No! We rolled in, kicked ass, and took shit over! Is that what a fag does?!
"
13,12,Stan,"Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"No, you're supposed to think we're not fags now!
"
13,12,Stan,"But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
"
13,12,Kyle,"I don't either.
"
13,12,Butters,"That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
"
13,12,Biker 14,"Who is this little fag?
"
13,12,Butters,"I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
"
13,12,Biker 15,"That's it, let's kill them all!
"
13,12,Cartman,"No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
"
13,12,Big Gay Al,"No one is killing anyone!  We've had enough! You faggots get the hell out of our town!
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"All right everyone, all right. We are fags. Yeah, we're fags. We're total fags. And yo know what? We like it.
"
13,12,Biker 2,"Yeah, we like being fags.
"
13,12,Lead Biker,"So go ahead, America. Whenever you pass by Harley riders like us, roll down your window, and yell ""Faggots!"" All you kids out there, when you see us, walk up to us, and say ""Hello, fags."" No, really, we want you to. At least we're cool enough to embrace who we are. Right guys?
"
13,12,Bikers,"That's right. You got it. Yeah. 
"
13,12,Biker 6,"Come on, fags, let's roll out! 
"
13,12,Stan,"...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
"
13,12,Emmanuel Lewis,"Let there be no perplexity: those individuals are the legitimate faggots. The definition shall be replaced. 
"
13,12,Stan,"We did it! Yeah!
"
13,12,Kyle,"Yeah! We did it, you guys! 
"
13,12,Cartman,"Oh it's over, it's finally over! 
"
13,12,Stan,"Today, we've made history.
"
13,13,Student,"Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements, Parent-teacher conferences begin next Thursday. If you have not yet done so, please turn in your parents' requested time sheets by the end of fifth period today.  Lunch today will be a choice of chicken tostadas or spaghetti with a marninara sauce and side salad.  Attention fourth graders: the fall registration for glee club starts tomorrow. Any interested students should fill out a-  Whoa, what's going on?
"
13,13,Intruder,"I'll killl you!  I swear to God I'll kill you!
"
13,13,Student,"Who are you?!
"
13,13,Intruder,"I'm the man who's gonna put a bullet between your eyes!
"
13,13,Student,"Hey! He's got a gun!
"
13,13,Intruder,"You little bastard! You fucked my wife! You think I wouldn't find out?!
"
13,13,Student,"Sir, please, I don't know you.
"
13,13,Intruder,"Yeah, right!
"
13,13,Man,"All right, what the hell is going on around here? You sir need to leave this area- 
"
13,13,Student,"Oh God, he shot him!
"
13,13,Intruder,"Ya had to push me, didn't ya?! NOW YOU!
"
13,13,Student,"HAAAAAAAAAA! Sir, I clearly don't know-  th-AAAAA! AAAA!
"
13,13,Intruder,"There! How's it feel, huh?!
"
13,13,Student,"Please, I don't know you! Uughuh!
"
13,13,Intruder,"You're Gordon Stoltski, right?! Truck driver from Chicago?!
"
13,13,Gordon,"No, I'm Gordon Stoltski, third grader who reads the morning announcements!
"
13,13,Intruder,"Yeah, right! We'll see if that's true. Go on, read the morning announcements!
"
13,13,Gordon,"SOMEBODY HELP ME!
"
13,13,Intruder,"I said do it! 
"
13,13,Gordon,"AAAAA! AAAAA! AAAAAAAAAA! AAA! Any, any interested students should fill out an applicant survey  WAA! WAAAAAAAAAA!
"
13,13,Intruder,"I knew you were lyin'! That was terrible! Now put your mouth over the barrel of this gun!
"
13,13,Gordon,"No please! I'm so scared!   I'm so scared!
"
13,13,Intruder,"DO IT!
"
13,13,Gordon,"Please! I'll duh, I'll do whatever you say! Here! Here I see! Here!  I got my mouth on the ba- 
"
13,13,Intruder,"Look at you now. We're all dead. 
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"We will always remember the way that Gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the Pledge of Allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. And even now that we know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, I know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. But now we must decide who will pick up up where little Gordon left off. Who will take his place reading the morning announcements? It's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? And although Gordon Stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Oh. My. Goodddd.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
"
13,13,Boy,"Yeah, I think it would be really fu-fu-fu-fun, and ru-ru-ru-rurrraise my self es-es-esesesteem.
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. 
"
13,13,Cartman,"He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?
"
13,13,Casey,"My name is Casey Miller, and I'm in the third grade.  Ever since I can remember people have told me I should read their morning announcements. My friends always said to me, ""Dear Casey, your voice is like butter to our ears. Could you please find a way to get that audible chocolate on the airwaves?"" Well, here I am, and hopefully I'll be the kid with the job. 
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, really nice, Mike, uh, maybe next time you can get past the first word. Oh, Casey Miller, good, you're trying out too?
"
13,13,Casey,"I'm tryin' out and dryin' out in the sultry summer sun that is my voice.
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. Eric, you wanna go next? 
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay Eric, I'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"What? What on earth are you askin' me that for?!
"
13,13,Cartman,"Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Get lost, you little dirtball!
"
13,13,Casey,"Excuse me?
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"I said take a hike!
"
13,13,Casey,"I don't understand... what I did wrong.
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Beat it, you're not gettin' the job! 
"
13,13,Cartman,"Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.
"
13,13,Butters,"Oh jeez!
"
13,13,Cartman,"But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
"
13,13,Kyle,"Will somebody shut him up?
"
13,13,Cartman,"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
"
13,13,Principal Victoria,"The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
"
13,13,Principal Victoria,"No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Well, because he was being murdered.
"
13,13,Cartman,"You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
"
13,13,Principal Victoria,"All we ask is you keep it shorter.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
"
13,13,Cartman,"Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' ""Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that.""  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.
"
13,13,Third Graders,"I pledge allegiance to the flag -
"
13,13,Cartman,"- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
"
13,13,Kindergartners,"- a socialist dunghole...
"
13,13,Cartman,"Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.
"
13,13,Kyle,"Oh God, no! 
"
13,13,Cartman,"Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.
"
13,13,Ike,"NOOO!
"
13,13,Cartman,"I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.
"
13,13,Butters,"Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?
"
13,13,Wendy,"Is what true?
"
13,13,Butters,"That you hate Smurfs?
"
13,13,Wendy,"I don't have time for this.
"
13,13,Butters,"Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
"
13,13,Melvins,"Yeah, that's right. We can ask. 
"
13,13,Wendy,"Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
"
13,13,Butters,"It is true!
"
13,13,Melvin 1,"Oh my God!
"
13,13,Melvin 2,"Yeah, bemememe
"
13,13,Melvin 3,"Oh my God!
"
13,13,Wendy,"Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! 
"
13,13,Butters,"What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
"
13,13,Casey,"Hyeah.
"
13,13,Melvin 1,"That was cool.
"
13,13,Melvin 4,"Awesome
"
13,13,Melvin 2,"Yeah, that was cool.
"
13,13,Melvin 3,"Yeah, great job.
"
13,13,Cartman,"""Thank you"" and this is to..?
"
13,13,Douglas,"Douglas.
"
13,13,Cartman,"""To Douglas."" There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.
"
13,13,Butters,"Hey Eric!
"
13,13,Cartman,"Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?
"
13,13,Butters,"Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
"
13,13,Cartman,"Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
"
13,13,Butters,"Cool, thanks.
"
13,13,Cartman,"That'll be five dollars.
"
13,13,Butters,"Oh, okay. 
"
13,13,Stan,"What the hell do you think you're doing?!
"
13,13,Cartman,"A book signing.
"
13,13,Stan,"I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
"
13,13,Cartman,"I do not directly say she's a slut!
"
13,13,Stan,"""Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end""!
"
13,13,Cartman,"You didn't read the rest, dude.
"
13,13,Stan,"""Or does she?""
"
13,13,Cartman,"""Or does she?"" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
"
13,13,Butters,"Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!
"
13,13,Boy 1,"""Shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings?"" 
"
13,13,Stan,"Hey hey, stop reading that!
"
13,13,Boy 1,"Wull what do you mean?
"
13,13,Stan,"Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
"
13,13,Boy 2,"Yes it does!
"
13,13,Casey,"Eric Cartman is simply making it so that all kids take responsibility to question their school leaders. We should all ask if our president is a penis-hungry hooker with a huge vagina. I'm Casey Miller. 
"
13,13,Stan,"Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
"
13,13,Wendy,"I really don't care, Stan.
"
13,13,Stan,"Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
"
13,13,Wendy,"I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! 
"
13,13,Cartman,"You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
"
13,13,Principal Victoria,"Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?
"
13,13,Cartman,"And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-
"
13,13,Cartman,"Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
"
13,13,Principal Victoria,"Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!
"
13,13,Cartman,"Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! 
"
13,13,Announcer,"Live, from the principal's office, these are the morning announcements. Here, is Eric Cartman.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 
"
13,13,Butters,"Whoa... 
"
13,13,Cartman,"The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.
"
13,13,Kyle,"""These, are the morning announcements."" 
"
13,13,Cartman,"Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.
"
13,13,Cartman Smurf,"No! No, you must leave the noble Smurfs alone! Who's behind all this?!  I should have known. Wendy!
"
13,13,Human Wendy,"Out of my way! 
"
13,13,Cartman Smurf,"Wendy, what are you doing here?!
"
13,13,Human Wendy,"Smurfberries are worth a lot of money. With all those Smurfberries I can power the school for the entire year.
"
13,13,Cartman Smurf,"Wendy, I know you're president of our school, but you can't just dig up the Smurfs' land!
"
13,13,Human Wendy,"Fuck the Smurfs! They can suck my fat tits! 
"
13,13,Cartman Smurf,"How many Smurfberries is enough, Wendy?!
"
13,13,Human Wendy,"You can suck my fat tits too! 
"
13,13,Cartman Smurf,"Smurfette noooo!
"
13,13,Human Wendy,"Suck mah fat tits!
"
13,13,Cartman,"And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?
"
13,13,Butters,"That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
"
13,13,A Melvin,"I can no longer stand idly by.
"
13,13,Butters,"We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
"
13,13,Casey,"It is time for that slutty Smurf-killing bitch to get what's comin' to 'er.
"
13,13,Melvins,"Yeah!
"
13,13,Butters,"I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 
"
13,13,Butters,"Let us not forget what happens this day!
"
13,13,A Melvin,"Woo on!
"
13,13,Butters,"We are here, Wendy Testaburger! 
"
13,13,Melvin 2,"Take that, school president!
"
13,13,Melvin 3,"Get her good!
"
13,13,Butters,"I am.
"
13,13,Wendy,"Hey, what are you doing?
"
13,13,Butters,"The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
"
13,13,Mr. Testaburger,"What the hell? 
"
13,13,Butters,"Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
"
13,13,Mr. Testaburger,"Wendy, did a boy just pee on our door because the Smurfs were murdered? 
"
13,13,Wendy,"It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
"
13,13,Wendy,"Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house.
"
13,13,Cartman,"People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
"
13,13,Wendy,"If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?
"
13,13,Cartman,"Of course. That's why we're here.
"
13,13,A Boy,"Five seconds. 
"
13,13,Cartman,"Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.
"
13,13,Wendy,"Sure.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
"
13,13,Wendy,"Okay.
"
13,13,Cartman,"How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? 
"
13,13,Wendy,"I don't, I, I have no idea what-
"
13,13,Cartman,"You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
"
13,13,Butters,"Ohhh, he's got her now!
"
13,13,Cartman,"Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
"
13,13,Wendy,"I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-
"
13,13,Cartman,"If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? 
"
13,13,Butters,"She's speechless!
"
13,13,Cartman,"You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
"
13,13,Wendy,"Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?
"
13,13,Wendy,"What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?
"
13,13,Cartman,"What? What do you mean I know that?
"
13,13,Wendy,"I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?
"
13,13,Cartman,"No! You wiped them all out!
"
13,13,Wendy,"Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!
"
13,13,Cartman,"Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
"
13,13,Wendy,"No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.
"
13,13,Stan,"What?!
"
13,13,Wendy,"And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.
"
13,13,Butters,"All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
"
13,13,A Melvin,"I'm confused.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
"
13,13,Wendy,"No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs.
"
13,13,Cartman,"No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
"
13,13,Wendy,"Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.
"
13,13,Cartman,"You sold the movie rights to who?!
"
13,13,Wendy,"James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
"
13,13,Cartman,"Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! 
"
13,13,Cartman,"Huh!
"
13,13,Stan,"Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
"
13,13,Cartman,"No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
"
13,13,Kyle,"Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
"
13,13,Cartman,"I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! 
"
13,13,Casey,"The sun is up and the birds are chirping. I'm Casey Miller and these, are the morning announcements. I have a letter from second-grade student Brian Falner. Brian writes, ""Dear Casey, why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead? My desk is broken, and so far Eric Cartman has done nothing about it. Will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy?"" Well Brian, I couldn't agree more. Our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake.
"
13,13,Cartman,"I'm doin' the best I can! 
"
13,14,Cartman,"We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park.
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like.
"
13,14,Stan,"Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. 
"
13,14,Cartman,"This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
"
13,14,Butters,"What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
"
13,14,Cartman,"No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
"
13,14,Jimmy,"Wha-what are you talking about, Eric?
"
13,14,Cartman,"You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
"
13,14,Stan,"We're here! It's the water park! 
"
13,14,Randy,"I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?
"
13,14,Cartman,"Come on, let's go!
"
13,14,Stan,"We got it, Dad.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Six adorable children please.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?! 
"
13,14,Kyle,"All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
"
13,14,Stan,"Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
"
13,14,Cartman,"Forget it! Just forget it! 
"
13,14,Stan,"Dude, this is awesome.
"
13,14,Kyle,"You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
"
13,14,Butters,"Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
"
13,14,Kyle,"Okay, go ahead. 
"
13,14,Butters,"Okay, thanks. 
"
13,14,Kyle,"I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
"
13,14,Stan,"Okay.
"
13,14,Kyle,"All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
"
13,14,Butters,"You said ""go ahead"".
"
13,14,Stan,"Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.
"
13,14,Kyle,"No dude, Butters' pee is in there.
"
13,14,Stan,"Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
"
13,14,Butters,"Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
"
13,14,Kyle,"No they don't!
"
13,14,Stan,"Yeah, they do, Kyle.
"
13,14,Jimmy,"To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tututwenty five seconds ago.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Dude!
"
13,14,Stan,"Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
"
13,14,Kyle,"NO!
"
13,14,Cartman,"What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.
There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!
"
13,14,Ride operator,"Guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-
"
13,14,Cartman,"Just do it in English!
"
13,14,Cartman,"There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).
"
13,14,Stan,"After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
"
13,14,Butters,"You bet!
"
13,14,Kyle,"I'm not getting back in the water.
"
13,14,Stan,"Aw come on, Kyle.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
"
13,14,Stan,"Not everybody pees in pools.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Do you pee in the pool?
"
13,14,Stan,"Not today... yet.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Aw, come on!
"
13,14,Stan,"Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
"
13,14,Kyle,"Most likely.
"
13,14,Cartman,"You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!
"
13,14,Stan,"Dude, where have you been?
"
13,14,Cartman,"I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!
"
13,14,Kyle,"So what?
"
13,14,Cartman,"So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Well then they're not minorities, are they?
"
13,14,Cartman,"...What do you mean?
"
13,14,Kyle,"Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
"
13,14,Cartman,"The black and brown people.
"
13,14,Kyle,"No, you're the minority!
"
13,14,Cartman,"Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!
"
13,14,Stan,"This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
"
13,14,Butters,"The who?
"
13,14,Cartman,"The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
"
13,14,Stan,"I'm gonna go on the slides.
"
13,14,Butters,"Whoopie! 
"
13,14,Cartman,"You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?
"
13,14,Kyle,"Blow it out your ass, Cartman! 
"
13,14,Elderly Woman,"Eugene, that is disgusting! Did you just pee in the pool?
"
13,14,Elderly Man,"Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Eewww! 
"
13,14,Water Tester,"Oh my God.
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi Pi. How can I heelp you.
"
13,14,Assistant,"Pi Pi, we have some dire news concerning your water park.
"
13,14,Water Tester,"I've just finished some tests. The water in your park is now ninety eight percent pee.
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?
"
13,14,Assistant,"Pi Pi, you know that acceptable pee levels in any water park is eighty three percent.  You have to shut down.
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggesteh weekend. Everyone is having uhtheh fun.
"
13,14,Water Tester,"You're endangering people's lives!  If those pee levels hit a hundred percent, there's no telling what'll happen!
"
13,14,Lawyer,"And what proof... do you have that the pee levels will go up?
"
13,14,Water Tester,"One in three people admit they pee in pools. Add another for people who do but don't admit it; that's two in three. You've got just over five hundred people out there; that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water!
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Gehntlemen, pleaseh. I come-a from ada Venice.  Venice is almost all pee. And we doin' just fine. We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee. You can't barge in here and tell me thuh, that I have to close down just because my wahter park has-a too much pee.
"
13,14,Water Tester,"You have to evacuate people now!
"
13,14,Lawyer,"He said he's not doing it! And as his lawyer I advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you!
"
13,14,Water Tester,"If one more person urinates in your pool, it could set off a chain reaction. Then the pee will be on your hands. 
"
13,14,Butters,"Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
"
13,14,Stan,"This is sweet, huh Kenny? 
"
13,14,Jimmy,"What what's that? 
"
13,14,Man 1,"It's pee! 
"
13,14,Man 2,"Look out for the pee! 
"
13,14,Kyle,"Aaaaah! Gross! 
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Aaaaa, it's-a the peeee! 
"
13,14,Floating Man,"Aaaah!
"
13,14,Stan,"Aaaah!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Aw, sick! 
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers. 
"
13,14,Randy,"What's going on?
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"I told you people to keep civilians back!
"
13,14,Randy,"Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"We don't know yet, all right?! There's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead. Now I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to-
"
13,14,Officer 1,"Captain, these two men claim to know the situation. 
"
13,14,Water Tester,"We warned the owner of the park, but he refused to shut down. This was inevitable.
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"So this is all pee-related.
"
13,14,Water Tester,"Yes, I... tested the pH levels this morning.
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"And?
"
13,14,Water Tester,"It was almost all pee, no H.
"
13,14,Randy,"Oh my God. I've gotta help him! 
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"Stay back!
"
13,14,Randy,"You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
"
13,14,Officer 2,"Sir, it's possible with the crane we could help any survivors out.
"
13,14,Water Tester,"I think that would be a very bad idea.
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"And why is that?
"
13,14,Water Tester,"Anyone inside there is contaminated. We have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee, they... change.
"
13,14,Fireman 1,"Change how?
"
13,14,Water Tester,"All right uh brubring in, bring in the monkey.  We've only tested the theory on monkeys so far. This monkey is healthy and normal in every way, but now, watch. 
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"My God, he's become full of rage!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Aahhh...
"
13,14,Stan,"Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
"
13,14,Kyle,"No way!
"
13,14,Jimmy,"You've gotta swim over here, Kyle.
"
13,14,Butters,"Come on, Kyle!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Dude, that's all pee!
"
13,14,Stan,"Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
"
13,14,Kyle,"I'll die if I do swim in it!
"
13,14,Stan,"Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
"
13,14,Stan,"...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
"
13,14,Kyle,"...What?!
"
13,14,Stan,"Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.
"
13,14,Kyle,"You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
"
13,14,Stan,"Not... all the time.
"
13,14,Kyle,"That is gross!!
"
13,14,Stan,"Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
"
13,14,Butters,"Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 
"
13,14,Stan,"Kyle, come on!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 
"
13,14,Butters,"Do you need to wash your hands?
"
13,14,Cartman,"Help! Help!
"
13,14,Man 1,"Here! Hey kid, grab this stick! 
"
13,14,Cartman,"Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh. 
"
13,14,Man 2,"Are you okay?
"
13,14,Cartman,"Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
"
13,14,Man 2,"Well what are we gonna do now?
"
13,14,Woman 1,"We've gotta just wait it out.
"
13,14,Woman 2,"Yeah, but for how long?
"
13,14,Man 3,"We need to find somethin' to paddle with.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. 
"
13,14,Sharon,"Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.
"
13,14,Randy,"It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!
"
13,14,Sharon,"What is all pee?
"
13,14,Randy,"Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.
"
13,14,Sharon,"What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!
"
13,14,Randy,"I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.
"
13,14,Sharon,"Randy, you've got to do something!
"
13,14,Randy,"Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"I said keep the media out! If the public hears about this we'll have a full-scale panic on our hands!  Damn it where is that antidote?!
"
13,14,Researcher 1,"Here! Here! We think we have it, sir!  It's the best we could come up with in such a short time! We aren't sure of the ramifications, but it does appear to neutralize some particles of the urine.
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"All right, let's test it. Bring in the monkeys! 
"
13,14,Water Tester,"Let's hope to Christ this works.  No, damn it, no!
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"They're still angry.
"
13,14,Researcher 1,"This one's really angry.
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"It's out of control!  Find an antidote that works! 
"
13,14,Kyle,"Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?
"
13,14,Stan,"I don't know. 
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Why? Why didn't Pi Pi leesten? They tried to warn-a the Pi Pi, but-a the Pi Pi not-a belieeve them. 
"
13,14,Stan,"Who are you?
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a ninety percent-a pee.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi Pi. In-a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open the door then the pee can be lowered.
"
13,14,Jimmy,"Okay, w-where's the maintenance room?
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"That is-a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest? 
"
13,14,Kyle,"No.
"
13,14,Butters,"You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Not in pee!
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Please-a you have to hurry!  I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Oh who pees in the shower?
"
13,14,Stan,"...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
"
13,14,Butters,"Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
"
13,14,Kyle,"You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Jesus Christ!

13,14,Cartman,"It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is ""Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?"" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... 
"
13,14,Teacher,"All right, Eric Cartman, let's hear your book report.
"
13,14,Cartman,"I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.
"
13,14,Teacher,"Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!
"
13,14,Cartman,"...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
"
13,14,Teacher,"Good.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder.
"
13,14,Señor Lopez,"You don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?
"
13,14,Cartman,"Well, I do just as much work.
"
13,14,Señor Lopez,"You're trash around here. You'll never make as much as a minority.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
"
13,14,Coucilman,"All those in favor of putting white people in camps?
"
13,14,Audience,"Aye!
"
13,14,Coucilman,"All those opposed?
"
13,14,Cartman,"Noooo...
"
13,14,Coucilman,"The minorities win! 
"
13,14,Cartman,"NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! 
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Let's just get this over with!
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"You've got-a the map and-a Pi Pi's instructions?
"
13,14,Kyle,"Yes.
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Good-a. Now just one last thing.  You need to drink-a some pee.
"
13,14,Kyle,"What?!
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Why?!
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"You swim-a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate.
"
13,14,Stan,"That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
"
13,14,Kyle,"I am not, not, d-rinking pee!
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"But only you can hold-a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!
"
13,14,Stan,"Just drink the pee, Kyle.
"
13,14,Butters,"Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!
"
13,14,Kyle,"That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly.
"
13,14,Kyle,"No!
"
13,14,Water Tester,"Make way! Make way! I need to speak to the fire marshal! Sir! Sir, I just got off the phone with my colleagues at the university! They've also been testing antidotes on monkeys! They're claiming that they've had success using simple Musa acuminata.
"
13,14,Researcher 2,"Wait, you mean a banana.
"
13,14,Water Tester,"Yes.
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"Is it possible... the antidote is something as simple as a banana? Get another monkey!  All right, Connors. 
"
13,14,Fireman 2,"Holy God, it works!
"
13,14,Police Captain,"All right, let's start moving in, everyone! Check the-
"
13,14,Water Tester,"Hold on, ih it is a promising lead, but this antidote hasn't yet been tested on a human.
"
13,14,Randy,"I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me. 
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"You sure you want to do this?
"
13,14,Randy,"Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.
"
13,14,Researcher 3,"He looks agitated...
"
13,14,Randy,"Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"He's losin' it! Stevens, your gun! 
"
13,14,Randy,"No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.
"
13,14,Water Tester,"He's all right!
"
13,14,Fireman 3,"The banana worked!
"
13,14,Stan,"Come on, dude!
"
13,14,Kyle,"I'm thinking about it!
"
13,14,Jimmy,"Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle.
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"There's no more time-a. You have to drink-a the pee NOW! 
"
13,14,Kyle,"Gah, ah.  Gaagh.
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee.
"
13,14,Butters,"You can do it, Kyle!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH! 
"
13,14,Pi Pi,"All right, now you can open the release-a valve. Okay, so let's-a 
"
13,14,Butters,"Hey look! 
"
13,14,Randy,"Stan! 
"
13,14,Stan,"All right, they finally came for us. 
"
13,14,Kyle,"Are you fucking kidding me?! 
"
13,14,Randy,"Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 
"
13,14,Cartman,"Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!
"
13,14,Butters,"Hawww, you lived?
"
13,14,Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
"
13,14,Kyle,"That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
"
13,14,Cartman,"It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
"
13,14,Stan,"Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
"
13,14,Water Tester,"All right everyone, quick! Here you go!
"
13,14,Butters,"What's this?
"
13,14,Fire Marshal,"You all need to eat your banana immediately!
"
13,14,Kyle,"What the hell for?!
"
13,14,Stevens,"Eat the banana or we have to put you down!
"
13,14,Kyle,"AAAAAAAA!
