15,1,Cartman,"Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads!  Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome! 
"
15,1,Craig,"Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.
"
15,1,Cartman,"What?
"
15,1,Craig,"Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. 
"
15,1,Cartman,"Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! 
"
15,1,Stan,"Let me see your iPad, Cartman.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! 
"
15,1,Kyle,"Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.
"
15,1,Cartman,"No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
"
15,1,Kyle,"So, plug it in.
"
15,1,Cartman,"I left my charger at home!  Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! 
"
15,1,Cartman,"Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
"
15,1,Liane,"What happened, Eric?
"
15,1,Cartman,"YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!
"
15,1,Kyle,"You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.
"
15,1,Man,"Oh. Yeah, Apple's stuff is pretty neat alright. I just don't want any big company tracking where I am at all times. 
"
15,1,Kyle,"Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- 
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"There he is!  Hello Kyle, we're from Apple. We're all ready for you now. 
"
15,1,Kyle,"What? Ready for what?
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"To fulfill the agreement. Can we get a weight please? 
"
15,1,Apple Man 2,"83 pounds, sir.
"
15,1,Kyle,"What ""agreement""?!
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"83 pounds, good. Let's get the bloodwork.
"
15,1,Kyle,"Hey! You can't do that! 
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"You agreed we could take all the blood we needed.
"
15,1,Kyle,"What are you talking about?!
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"When you downloaded the last iTunes update a window on your screen popped up and asked you if you agreed to our terms and conditions. You clicked ""Agree."" Alright, let's get him to the water tank.
"
15,1,Kyle,"The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"You've agreed to all of this!  Hey!
"
15,1,Kyle,"You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
"
15,1,Stan,"What?
"
15,1,Kyle,"It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!
"
15,1,Stan,"Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
"
15,1,Kyle,"I don't know, I didn't read them!
"
15,1,Butters,"You didn't read them?
"
15,1,Kyle,"Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
"
15,1,Stan,"I do.
"
15,1,Clyde,"Me too.
"
15,1,Kyle,"You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?
"
15,1,Jimmy,"Of course.
"
15,1,Butters,"Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
"
15,1,Kyle,"Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"There he is. Hey you!
"
15,1,Kyle,"Gahhh! 
"
15,1,Kyle,"Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!
"
15,1,Gerald,"Kyle? What are you doing here?
"
15,1,Kyle,"Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!
"
15,1,Gerald,"Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.
"
15,1,Kyle,"But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
"
15,1,Gerald,"Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. 
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"Here he is!
"
15,1,Kyle,"AAHH!
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"Come on you!
"
15,1,Gerald,"Hey, what the heck is going on?
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"Your son has made a binding and legal agreement with Apple, sir.
"
15,1,Gerald,"An agreement to do what?!
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"Apple's inner workings are top secret to all users. You know how it is.
"
15,1,Gerald,"No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"You what?
"
15,1,Apple Man 4,"Come on, let's go!
"
15,1,Gerald,"Hey now, let him go! 
"
15,1,Kyle,"Dad! You tasered my dad!
"
15,1,Apple Man 1,"You said we could.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
"
15,1,Liane,"Oh, sweetie, $900?
"
15,1,Cartman,"I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
"
15,1,Liane,"Eric, we can't afford that one.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
"
15,1,Liane,"I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
"
15,1,Liane,"Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Toshiba Handibook??
"
15,1,Liane,"This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
"
15,1,Liane,"Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!
"
15,1,Cartman,"Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!
"
15,1,Liane,"Eric!
"
15,1,Cartman,"You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!
"
15,1,Liane,"Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!
"
15,1,Cartman,"But I told you I was sorry.
"
15,1,Liane,"You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!
"
15,1,Cartman,"I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
"
15,1,Liane,"Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say ""Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!""?
"
15,1,Cartman,"Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Momma.
"
15,1,Liane,"If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!
"
15,1,Cartman,"Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
"
15,1,Liane,"No!
"
15,1,Cartman,"Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! 
"
15,1,Woman,"What are you going to do to us??
"
15,1,Kyle,"What is this? What's going on?
"
15,1,Woman,"You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??
"
15,1,Kyle,"...What?
"
15,1,Woman,"I just clicked ""Agree."" I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!
"
15,1,Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) I can't even read Engrish!
"
15,1,Guard,"Hey, shut up in there! You all agreed to stay quiet!
"
15,1,Kyle,"Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
"
15,1,Guard,"You can't agree by accident. There's a fail-safe built in. Even if you click on ""Agree"" another little window pops up that says ""Are you sure you agree?"" and you have to click on ""Agree"" again.
"
15,1,Woman,"Uh, what are you going to do to us??
"
15,1,Guard,"Everything that you agreed to in the iTunes conditions.
"
15,1,Kyle,"We didn't read them!
"
15,1,Guard,"Heh! Riiight. Who just agrees to something they don't read? 
"
15,1,Announcer,"And now, the president of Apple, Steve Jobs! 
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"Hello everyone, I'm here to announce a new product that will once again revolutionize the way we use our phones and tablet devices. Let's hear it for our volunteers!  These three people have agreed to be brought here, handcuffed to these beds, and become the prototype of our first truly-interfaced device.
"
15,1,Kyle,"The first what?
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"They have actually agreed to be surgically altered.  Their lips will be removed and they will be sewn together mouth to anus.
"
15,1,Woman,"What??
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"You agreed to this!  Mouth to anus so that the feces so that the gastral tract from one will enter the mouth of the little boy -  and he agreed this was okay - enter the mouth of the little boy, leading through his anus to the mouth of the female - who completely agreed; they all agreed - which will then go to a tablet device, making a product that is part human, and part centipede, and part Web browser, and part emailing device! I give you... the HUMANCENTiPad!
"
15,1,Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Oho... I should habu never appudeitedo iTunes!
"
15,1,Butters,"""You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store.""
"
15,1,Gerald,"Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!
"
15,1,Stan,"We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
"
15,1,Gerald,"There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
"
15,1,Butters,"Hold up. Here it is right here: ""by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user""
"
15,1,Stan,"Oh boy.
"
15,1,Butters,"""Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract."" Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... ""Decline.""
"
15,1,Gerald,"Well that does it! I'm going to the police!
"
15,1,Stan,"For what?
"
15,1,Gerald,"To find out where Apple is keeping my son!
"
15,1,Stan,"Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
"
15,1,Butters,"The Geniuses...
"
15,1,Kenny,"(The Geniuses...)
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"Alright. Good. Looks good, guys. Great work. 
"
15,1,Junichi,"Nanda... Nanda kore?! 
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"Really nice, guys.  I remember when the first version of the iPad came out. People couldn't believe how easy it was to take their videos, music, and photos, and all their shit,  and share it, with other people, who could do the same with all their shit. The only thing the iPad couldn't do was walk or read. Until now.
"
15,1,Kyle,"(I need some help! I can't take it!)
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"What, what what's that? What's that you're saying?
"
15,1,Kyle,"(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"Yeah you want out? Are you saying you want out?
"
15,1,Kyle,"(Yes! Please! Let me go!)
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"Fine. You don't want to be part of this? Then just sign right here.  Nooo! You didn't read it! This says we don't ever have to let you out and that we can do whatever we want!  Dammit, why won't it read?!
"
15,1,Apple Tech,"It's probably low on power. We should feed it.
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"Alright. Here you go, come on.
"
15,1,Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Nooo!  I will not eat if they are forced to iito my poo!
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"Perhaps I didn't mention...  it's a bean and cheese burrito from Paco's.
"
15,1,Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Sori, Kairu. I tried to resist but burrito isu too dericious! 
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"We have to unveil this thing tomorrow. It better be reading by then!
"
15,1,Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Oh, oh no... feel sick...
"
15,1,Kyle,"(You're fine!)
"
15,1,Junichi,"Oooho, oooh! 
"
15,1,Kyle,"(Yaaaaah!) 
"
15,1,Woman,"(Aaaaaah!)
"
15,1,Announcer,"Today, on Dr. Phil. The tragic story of a little boy whose mother constantly tries to fuck him.
"
15,1,Dr. Phil,"I want you all to meet Eric Cartman, who's a very special boy with a very hard life. Eric, you say that your mom fucks you?
"
15,1,Cartman,"Yes! She fucks me so hard!
"
15,1,Dr. Phil,"Does this happen often? Does she- does she fuck you a lot?
"
15,1,Cartman,"Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
"
15,1,Audience,"Ohhh...
"
15,1,Dr. Phil,"Now, I know this is very difficult for you to talk about, but... where was the last time your mother fucked you?
"
15,1,Cartman,"At Best Buy.
"
15,1,Audience,"Ahhh...
"
15,1,Dr. Phil,"Your mother fucked you at Best Buy?
"
15,1,Cartman,"Uh huh.
"
15,1,Dr. Phil,"And people saw her doing this?
"
15,1,Cartman,"Yes!
"
15,1,Dr. Phil,"And they didn't do anything?
"
15,1,Cartman,"No!
"
15,1,Liane,"Eric, stop it!
"
15,1,Cartman,"Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 
"
15,1,Audience,"Booooooo!
"
15,1,Cartman,"Booooooo!
"
15,1,Liane,"Eric, you come home, right now!
"
15,1,Audience,"Booooooo!
"
15,1,Dr. Phil,"Ma'am, why do you think it's okay to fuck your son?
"
15,1,Liane,"I DON'T!
"
15,1,Cartman,"She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
"
15,1,Audience,"Awwwwww!
"
15,1,Cartman,"You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
"
15,1,Man 1,"You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!
"
15,1,Man 2,"If I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first! 
"
15,1,Dr. Phil,"Well Eric, we have a very special gift we wanna give you.
"
15,1,Cartman,"An iPad??? 
"
15,1,Announcer,"Gerald Broflovski.
"
15,1,Stan,"Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. 
"
15,1,Leslie,"Hi, my name is Leslie. I'll be your Genius.
"
15,1,Stan,"Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
"
15,1,Leslie,"What problems are you experiencing?
"
15,1,Gerald,"My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!
"
15,1,Leslie,"Oh-kay, well I'm sorry you're having trouble with that today. Could I have his Apple ID?
"
15,1,Stan,"69ingchipmunks@me.com 
"
15,1,Leslie,"Okay. 
"
15,1,Gerald,"Well what the heck does this w-! 
"
15,1,Leslie,"Oh okay. I see. Hmm. Hmm, I might need to bring another Genius in on this.  Frothgar?
"
15,1,Frothgar,"Uh huh?
"
15,1,Leslie,"This guy's son was abducted by us?  Should I run a stop-check or just give him store credit?
"
15,1,Gerald,"No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!
"
15,1,Frothgar,"'Kay, this says he agreed to be taken and made part of any experiments Apple wants to perform.
"
15,1,Stan,"Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
"
15,1,Frothgar,"He didn't read it?
"
15,1,Butters,"We know. It's preposterous.
"
15,1,Frothgar,"Hrrrrgh. 
"
15,1,Leslie,"Sooo, just give them store credit?
"
15,1,Junichi,"Aarrrgh. Dame kore!  (In Japanese Accent) So sori Kairu, but I am starving! Which would you rather I eat? Should I iito cuttlefish and asparagus, or the vanilla peisuto?
"
15,1,Kyle,"(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!)
"
15,1,Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Cuttlefish and asparagus?
"
15,1,Kyle,"(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
"
15,1,Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Very well I will iito the cuttlefish. 
"
15,1,Kyle,"(NOOOO!) 
"
15,1,Rescuer 1,"Go, go! Come on guys, come on! Go!  Don't worry. We're here to help you. 
"
15,1,Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Oh! Oh, thank you! Thank you! 
"
15,1,Rescuer 1,"Come on, hurry! We have an ambulance waiting outside.
"
15,1,Rescuer 1,"Just try to stay calm. We're gonna have to try and get you separated right away!
"
15,1,Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Yes, please hurry! That cuttlefish and asparagus is noto sitting well.
"
15,1,Rescuer 1,"We got it! We got it! Doctor, can you take this thing apart?!
"
15,1,Doctor,"If I'm going to perform surgery, I need permission.  Sign this release so we can operate.
"
15,1,Kyle,"(Yes. Yes, hurry up.) 
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"No, dammit! It didn't read it! End of simulation, end of simulation!  What is wrong with you people?! Why can't you get the HumancentiPad to read?!
"
15,1,Rescuer,"We're sorry, sir. We really thought we'd get it to read this time.
"
15,1,Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Oh no! Cuttlefish is about to come out ofu asshole!
"
15,1,Kyle,"(Oh, shit!)
"
15,1,Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Here it comes! Oh, it's going to be arot! Hold on, Kairu! I believe in youuuuuu!!! 
"
15,1,Frothgar,"Yeap. A-and then you should be able to do a customer check, uh huh.
"
15,1,Leslie,"Okay, that should do it. Sorry Apple kidnapped your friend, guys. But I believe we have it all cleared up.
"
15,1,Gerald,"You do??
"
15,1,Leslie,"Yeah, we got you a replacement friend. You should be all good to go.
"
15,1,Replacement Friend,"Hi guys.
"
15,1,Stan,"No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.
"
15,1,Frothgar,"We're gonna have to bring more Geniuses in on this.
"
15,1,Leslie,"Yeah, I think we should have a quickening, with all the Geniuses.
"
15,1,Frothgar,"I'll summon the council.
"
15,1,Leslie,"Okay, if you guys just wait here a sec we're gonna have a quickening with the Council of Geniuses. See what we can do for you.
"
15,1,Leslie,"Do you know if your friend has a Verizon or AT&T mobile number associated with his dot-me account?
"
15,1,Stan,"I think Verizon.
"
15,1,Leslie,"Okay. 
"
15,1,Field Reporter,"Tom, it's a big exciting day for Mac Apple users: the unveiling of the first HumancentiPad. As part of a clear PR stunt, Apple has joined up with Best Buy and Dr. Phil to donate the first centiPad to a needy boy who was raped by his mother.
"
15,1,Dr. Phil,"In all my years I've never heard a more tragic story than that of Eric Cartman,  and I wanna thank the Apple company for helping us make today a very special day for him.
"
15,1,Crowd,"Yaaaaaaaaay!
"
15,1,Best Buy President,"As as president of Best Buy, Eric,  I want to assure you that a child will never get fucked in one of our stores again.
"
15,1,Crowd,"Yaaaaaaaaay! 
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"When Dr. Phil contacted us at Apple with Eric's story, we knew we had to get aboard.  And so, Eric, here is your very own HumancentiPad. 
"
15,1,Cartman,"Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
"
15,1,Reporter 1,"Yes but, can it read?
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"Don't worry. It took a while, but I'm pretty sure it has finally learned to read, hasn't it?! 
"
15,1,Kyle,"(Yes. I promise I'll read.)
"
15,1,Crowd,"Hooraaaaaaaaay!
"
15,1,Gerald,"What the hell are they doing now?!
"
15,1,Butters,"The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
"
15,1,Gerald,"Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-
"
15,1,Leslie,"It's okay, sir. The Toran Ra has revealed the answer to your problem. We can retroactively make your son's agreement invalid.
"
15,1,Gerald,"Okay! Finally! How do we do that?
"
15,1,Leslie,"It's very easy. You will simply need to join Apple.
"
15,1,Gerald,"Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!
"
15,1,Leslie,"But if you join we can make your son's account into a family account, and then you have to iApprove all his agreements.
"
15,1,Stan,"Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?
"
15,1,Gerald,"Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.
"
15,1,Leslie,"Kali fi!
"
15,1,Leslie,"Gerald Broflovski, do you agree to let Apple track your location at all times?
"
15,1,Gerald,"I agree.
"
15,1,Leslie,"Do you agree to give Apple access to all your personal information, including but not limited to your favorite movies, songs, and books?
"
15,1,Gerald,"I agree.
"
15,1,Leslie,"Do you agree to care about your membership, and prove that you care by purchasing AppleCare?
"
15,1,Cartman,"Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
"
15,1,Staffer,"Sir! Sir, we have a problem! 
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"What? What do you mean we have to take it apart?! The boy's agreement isn't valid?
"
15,1,Staffer 2,"Sorry, we have to recall this.
"
15,1,Cartman,"What?! Hey, that's mine!
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"I don't care what the Geniuses say! Dammit, I'm trying to create the future here!
"
15,1,Gerald,"We are all trying to create the future!  I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other.  Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"You know something? I agree.
"
15,1,Crowd,"Awww. 
"
15,1,Steve Jobs,"Come on. We'll get you separated, little boy.  Guess you won't be eating Japanese food for a while, huh? 
"
15,1,Cartman,"Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! 
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Here you go.  Here you  go. Don't forget to...  vote, everyone.  Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.
"
15,2,Cartman,"What's this?
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show.
"
15,2,Kyle,"Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?
"
15,2,Stan,"Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
"
15,2,Kyle,"Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.
"
15,2,Mr. Mackey,"Attention students, m'kay? There will be a presentation by the special education department in the gymnasium Friday during lunch and recess, m'kay? Attendance to this assembly is mandatory. All students and faculty are required to go. Uh which, which I guess means I gotta suck it too, huh? Uh huh, m'kay.
"
15,2,Stan,"Oh man, really?
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Don't worry, everybody. I've spared no expense to make my comedy awards the biggest thing this school has ever seen. You're all gonna have a blast. 
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Welcome... to the special ed department's... first annual comedy awards.

15,2,Jimmy,"Woohoo! Alright!  Oh boy, what a terrific audience. Can I get a wuhwuhwuh what? What?  We're here today to honor those who t-t-tirelessly work so hard to make us laugh. The first comedy award we are presenting is for the funniest kid in school. And the nominees are:

15,2,Stan,"Can we go now?

15,2,Jimmy,"Go? We still have over fifty awards to hand out.
"
15,2,Crowd,"Awww!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"...and the winner for best comedy performance in a movie is...  Ben Stiller! Come on up here, Ben.  Is Ben Stiller here?  No? Huh... I guess B-ben Stiller could not be with us, so I'll accept this award on his behalf.  And the award for funniest correspondents dinner speech goes to...  President Obama!  Is President Obama here? No? Ah I guess we'll just accept this award on his behalf.
"
15,2,Timmy,"Livin' a lie! Timmy!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Wow, what a terrific audience. Isn't this great.  Can I get another wuhwuh wha wha what what?  And now it's time to give out the award for the least funny people in the world. And the nominees are: 
"
15,2,Announcer,"The Germans... The Japanese... The Yupik Eskimos of the Chukchee Peninsula
"
15,2,Jimmy,"And the winner is... the Germans!  Uhhh... I guess unfortunately the Germans could not be with us tonight. So I will accept this award on their behalf.  Auf Wiedersehen.  And now, for the Kathy Griffin Award. The Kathy Griffin Award will be given each year to the person who is most likely to actually show up to receive the Kathy Griffin Award. And the winner is...  Tyler Perry. 
"
15,2,Tyler Perry,"Yeah! Yeeaahh! Yes! Yeeaahh! 
"
15,2,Timmy,"Timmy Timmy Timmy! Timmih!
"
15,2,Tyler Perry,"Oh! Man, I wanna thank you all for this amazing award, or as Madea would say, ""Halleluyer!"" 
"
15,2,Token,"Oh God, how embarrassing.
"
15,2,Tyler Perry,"Good afternoont! Halloer! I'd also really like to thank my-
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Okay, thahks, Tyler Perry.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry.
"
15,2,Ryan,"Uh huh...
"
15,2,Jimmy,"I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!
"
15,2,Ryan,"Mnn. Mhm.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Dad, I'm really feeling sad and let down right now, and I feel like I can't even get a response from you. Could I at the very least please just get a what what-what?
"
15,2,Ryan,"What. Uh, what?!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Thanks, Dad.
"
15,2,Sarah,"Jimmy! They're talking about your comedy awards! On the national news!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"The national news? Oh my gosh! People do care! 
"
15,2,Anchor,"A school in Colorado has declared Germans the least funny people in the world. The first annual comdey awards were held by the schoolchildren yesterday, and all of Germany is outraged.
"
15,2,President Wulff,"Jaaa jaaa jaaa! Deutschland ist ein Land aus stolz' Leuten. Und wir werden nicht dies' Beleid' 'nehmen. Der Comedy Awarden-Wahler haben sich Schand' auf'legt. Die Comedy Awarden-Wahler sind falsch! Ich möcht' der Welt absich', da' wir Deutschen sehr sehr sehr lustig sind. Wir machen die Witzlein in Büro und zu Haus'. Ich werde jetzt ein' deutsch' Witz sagen. Un Wurstmacher kauft ein' Müslibox. Ich werde jetzt noch ander' Witz sagen. Nockwast, nockwast.Wer ist das?Ein Kannibal'.Was?!Du bist etwa zu sterben und ge'essen werden.Schwein'hund! Ich werde zuerst umbringen!""
"
15,2,Anchor,"President Wulff went on to assure the world that Germans have a great sense of humor, and that retaliation towards the schoolchildren who said they don't will be swift and brutal.
"
15,2,Cartman,"Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!
"
15,2,Stan,"We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Duh-n, don't worry fellas. Everything's gonna be okay.
"
15,2,Cartman,"Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success.
"
15,2,Kyle,"A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
"
15,2,Tyler Perry,"Halleluyer! Somebody call the IHOP, 'cause I made pancakes!
"
15,2,Butters,"Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
"
15,2,Cartman,"Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"No don't worry, everybody. I'm sure that Germany can take a joke just like the rest of us. 
"
15,2,Boy with Red Scarf,"It's the Germans! 
"
15,2,President Wulff,"Switch! Switch! Switch! Oder alle sterben! 
"
15,2,German 1,"Jaja! Lasst die Hände hoch! 
"
15,2,German 2,"Niemand fucking Schritt! 
"
15,2,Angela Merkel,"Glaubst du, dass die Deutschen kein' Humor hat?! Huh?! 
"
15,2,Kyle,"Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"What- what am I supposed to s-say?
"
15,2,Cartman,"Ugh, let me talk to them. 
"
15,2,President Wulff,"Was machst du? Rück mit die andern. 
"
15,2,Cartman,"Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 
"
15,2,President Wulff,"Wie ein Fehler? 
"
15,2,Cartman,"Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. 
"
15,2,President Wulff,"Wollen Sie endlich beutren sein? 
"
15,2,Cartman,"Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. 
"
15,2,President Wulff,"Zurück! Mit ander, oder sterben! 
"
15,2,Cartman,"Well, I tried.
"
15,2,Stan,"What the hell are they gonna do to us?
"
15,2,Tyler Perry,"Oh my Lerd! What are we gonna doer? 
"
15,2,Token,"Aw, damn it. 
"
15,2,President Wulff,"Kommen auf! Schnell! Wir warten zu lang!  Schnell, schnell! 
"
15,2,Angela Merkel,"SCHNELL! 
"
15,2,President Wulff,"Ja, ja! Das ist gut! 
"
15,2,Robot,"Did you hear that the governor's mansion in Alabama burned down? It pretty much took out the whole trailer park. 
"
15,2,President Wulff,"Jaaa! Jaaa! Now what you say, maaan?! Here, is the greatest feat of German engineering! The XJ-212 Vudenkrein Funnybot!
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Why doesn't a chicken wear pants? Because its pecker is on its head.  What do you see when the Pillsbury Dough Boy bends over? Doughnuts.  Don't you just hate doing  homework?
"
15,2,Kids,"Yeah.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Me too. Man I hate homework. Honestly, I hate having to do homework, more than I hate having to do Bryant Gumble in his asshole. Awkwaaard.  Awkwaaard. Awkwaaard.
"
15,2,President Wulff,"Und now, Comedy Award voters, you will RE-VOTE  RE-VOTE! 
"
15,2,Sandy Cervix,"Welcome to Hollywood Minute. I'm Sandy Cervix and I'm deaf in one ear. It's been two weeks now since the prestigious voters of the Comedy Awards reversed their vote and said Germans were no longer the least funny people in the world. All thanks to the new ground-breaking German comedian, Funnybot.  It was after being voted the least funny people on the planet that the Germans first engineered Funnybot, a super automaton with perfect timing to within .0001 milliseconds. Since then, Funnybot has seen a meteoric rise to stardom, selling out standup theaters all over the world.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"I am Funnybot. Don't you hate how Mexicans always complain about turtles in their vaginas?  I am Funnybot.  You, sir. Where are you from?
"
15,2,Man with Afro,"Long Island!
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Does everyone in Long Island have hair that looks like pussy, you dipshit? 
"
15,2,Sandy Cervix,"Funnybot has exploded onto the silver screen too. 
"
15,2,Eugene Levy,"Hey! What are you doing with my daughters?! 
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Awkwaaard!
"
15,2,Sandy Cervix,"And this June, Funnybot shows off his range by playing every role in... Family Funbot
"
15,2,Funbot,"Pass me the potatoes, mother.
"
15,2,Mother,"Pass them yourself.
"
15,2,Father,"That boy too fat to be eating potatoes.
"
15,2,Grandmother Mother,"Don't you call my little chubby baby fat, you ball-licker.
"
15,2,Uncle,"Oho, it's getting hot up in here.
"
15,2,Sandy Cervix,"Funnybot, is there a line you won't cross?
"
15,2,Funnybot,"The line is a non sequitur. The line is an imaginary invention of imperfect biological life forms. I am Funnybot.
"
15,2,Sandy Cervix,"What's that? Could you say that in the other ear?
"
15,2,Cartman,"Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on ""Saturday Night Live""?
"
15,2,Stan,"Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.
"
15,2,Cartman,"He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on ""Nurse Jackie"" and on ""Rockin' The Boat.""
"
15,2,Stan,"What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"What's the matter is this Funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy. I don't think things are better, I think they're worse.
"
15,2,Tyler Perry,"Ya everything's worse. It's the worstest of the worst, that's what I'm sayin'. Oh lerrrd. 
"
15,2,Cartman,"Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!
"
15,2,Token,"I can't help it!
"
15,2,Stan,"All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. 
"
15,2,Adam Sandler,"You little shit! What the fuck have you done to us?!
"
15,2,Cartman,"Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.
"
15,2,Adam Sandler,"Everyone into the school gymnasium! Move!
"
15,2,Stan,"Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-
"
15,2,Adam Sandler,"Into the gymnasium now!
"
15,2,Kids,"Nnnaw
"
15,2,Butters,"Not again.
"
15,2,Another kid,"Aw crap.
"
15,2,Adam Sandler,"Come on come on let's go! 
"
15,2,Jay Leno,"You little fuckers! Your comedy awards show has put us all out of work!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Now look, I know that I've put every comedian in the world out of work, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual Comedy Awards was a success.
"
15,2,Adam Sandler,"Who the fuck things a comedy awards show is a good idea?!
"
15,2,Kyle,"Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"What is up with Sandra Bullock? I wouldn't eat her dick with Stevie Wonder's vagina.  And now for my next joke:  Awkaaard.
"
15,2,Announcer,"This is breaking news from CNN.
"
15,2,Anchor,"Shock and disbelief tonight as the German-engineered Funnybot delivered his opening lines at the Hollywood Forum, then opened fire on the audience of eleven hundred, killing nearly all of them. Spectators say the violent attack was unmotivated, irrational, and also, pretty Goddamned funny, solidifying the opinion once agan that Funnybot may be the greatest comedian of all time.
"
15,2,Field Reporter,"Tom, you should have seen the looks on people's faces as Funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vagina-obsessed Hispanics to Sandra Bullock, then spontaneously started shhhooting people  in their faces and in their chests. The blood went flying and oh shit it was funny.
"
15,2,Cartman,"Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. 
"
15,2,Stan,"'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot.
"
15,2,Guard,"Who doesn't wanna talk to Funnybot? He's the biggest comedian in the world.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed.
"
15,2,Kyle,"Butters! Butters, is everything okay?
"
15,2,Butters,"Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
"
15,2,Jay Leno,"Those fuckers! Let's just kill them, Sandler!  Let's just kill them all, right fuckin' now! 
"
15,2,Adam Sandler,"Tell your friends they'd better get it done!
"
15,2,Butters,"Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
"
15,2,Tyler Perry,"You know when a man be cheatin', he never know what to say.  But a woman? Them things think quiiick! 
"
15,2,Adam Sandler,"Will somebody get Tyler Perry to shut up?!
"
15,2,Kyle,"Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!
"
15,2,Guard,"All right, but make it quick!  Funnybot is very busy in there coming up with new material! 
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Error. Error. Banal. That has been done before. 
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Excuse me, Funnybot. My name is Jimmy, and I'm a stand-up comic. You're putting a lot of good people out of work.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Non sequitur. Other comedians are unnecessary. Funnybot must finish routine.
"
15,2,Kyle,"I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Funnybot is now finished with final joke.  Seeking mainframe access for execution of last joke ever.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean? 
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Seeking mainframe.
"
15,2,Guard,"Heey! Whoa, you can't go that way! 
"
15,2,Stan,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
15,2,Funnybot,"I am taking comedy to the next level. The extermination of all biological life on earth!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Wuh w-what?!
"
15,2,Funnybot,"It is the ultimate joke. Humans make comedy, humans build robot, robot ends all life on earth, robot feels awkward. EXTERMINATE! 
"
15,2,Stan,"Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?
"
15,2,Funnybot,"That is my purpose: to be ultimate comedian.
"
15,2,Kyle,"Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!
"
15,2,Cartman,"It's kind of funny, you guys.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Funnybot, this is not a good joke. There won't be anyone around to laugh.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"I am taking comedy to its logical conclusion. Mathematical equation of comedy used to be setup, punchline. Today's comedy is setup, punchline, then ""Awkwaaard."" Nothing is more awkward than destroying all that which created Funnybot.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"But don't you see? This is why comedy is for humans. You need to leave the jokes to people like me and Adam Sandler.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"I wouldn't let Adam Sandler suck my saggy tits for one million dollars worth of Oprah's tampons. 
"
15,2,Officer 1,"Sir! We've got a code 6!  All nuclear missiles are preparing for launch!
"
15,2,General,"What? There was no drill ordered!
"
15,2,Officer 2,"It's no drill, sir. The Russians are saying their missiles are going online as well and it isn't their doing.
"
15,2,General,"The hell is going on?! 
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Attention humans! I am Funnybot! The extermination of all life on Earth shall now commence!  All nuclear devices in the United States and Russia are being prepared to launch!  This is the setup to the joke! Prepare for punchline in five minutes! Awkwardness in 5.4 minutes! I am Funnybot!
"
15,2,President Obama,"I have just been briefed that the end of our country... is imminent. Goodbye, everybody. I'm going to spend my final moments on this Earth with my loved ones... watching a Tyler Perry movie. I know, it's embarrassing. But I simply can't help myself.
"
15,2,Cartman,"Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.
"
15,2,Stan,"We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
"
15,2,Cartman,"Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
"
15,2,Kyle,"Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?
"
15,2,Stan,"A what?
"
15,2,Kyle,"Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
"
15,2,Cartman,"Paradox...
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Oh my God! That's it! Fellas, get me a Ken doll and some Scotch tape.  Funnybot, I've been talking it over with the fellas and actually, we think what you're doing is genius.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Funnybot is simply pushing the limits of comedy
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"For what purpose is comedy award?
"
15,2,Jimmy,"It's a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Non sequitur. There is no logic in comedy award. Unable to process. Comedy award is- what is the meaning? If I accept it means I take comedy seriously. If I take comedy seriously, I am not comedian. Non sequitur. Must... analyze...  Analyze... 
"
15,2,Kyle,"It's working! 
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Explain comedy award! Unable to process! Awkwaaard!  Awkwaaard! 
"
15,2,Stan,"That's it! Hurry! Gooo! 
"
15,2,Stan,"Okay we got it! We got it! 
"
15,2,Adam Sandler,"Get it to the platform! Hurry!
"
15,2,Adam Sandler,"Well, that does it. Things can finally get back to normal.
"
15,2,Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"Thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together.
"
15,2,Kyle,"No problem, Funnybot.
"
15,2,Funnybot,"I understand now that comedy should be left to the imperfect biological beings.
"
15,2,Token,"I can't believe it's finally over. 
"
15,2,Tyler Perry,"Oh Lerrrd, somebody turn on the light. What's goin' on? Hellowwer!
"
15,2,President Obama,"I am please to announce that the greatest threat to mankind is now gone forever. Justice has been done.
"
15,2,Token,"Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!
"
15,2,Cartman,"Or will there be?
"
15,3,Pianist,"Welcome, O Welcome to our little play. It's our hope that you all learn something today.
"
15,3,Tooth,"I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
"
15,3,Toothbrush,"I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
"
15,3,Cast,"Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. 
"
15,3,Toothbrush,"His name is Toothuhkay.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Where is Tooth Decay? Tooth Decay that's your cue! 
"
15,3,Dental Floss,"He's not here.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"What do you mean he's not here?
"
15,3,Dental Floss,"He's at home watching the royal wedding.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"The what??
"
15,3,Hard Candy,"He said he had to watch it.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Is this some kind of joke? We are two weeks into tent rehearsals! Who the heck would sit at home watching the royal wedding?!
"
15,3,Narrator,"It is a glorious spring morning and literally thousands have gathered for the royal wedding.  People are still filing inside the abbey to watch the prince and princess of Canada exchange their vows. What a great day for Canadians everywhere.  The Winnipeg players playing the March Of A Thousand Farts, as is traditional for the Canadian Royal Family.  All the biggest Canadian celebrities are on hand. There are Sirs Terrance and Phillip, with their wives, the lovely Queef Sisters.  I believe tha-yes, I believe that one of the sisters just queefed, just now.  There are Canadian recording artists, Sir Bryan Adams and Sir Corey Hart. Everyone is looking smashing today. And- Ah, there he is! The Prince of Canada.  What a wonderful day it is for him; what a wonderful day it is for all of us. Inside the abbey now, everyone waiting with anticipation. There's the Queen of Canada, in attendance of course.  I believe she just queefed. The Prince makes his way down the aisle led by the Bishop of Newfoundland. People in attendance now gently tossing Captain Crunch as the Prince passes by. As of course is tradition.  Prince takes his place next to the large vat of butterscotch pudding. Oh, and here she comes. Yes, there she is! The aboot to be Princess of Canada. Isn't she ravishing, so innocent of heart, so strong in body, so hot in the face? She is indeed the living symbol of our great country. My God, she's beautiful.
"
15,3,Ike,"Princess, princess. 
"
15,3,Narrator,"Canadian prince now dipping his arms into the pudding.  As is tradition.  Princess will of course scrape the pudding off the prince's arms, thus symbolizing their union. What a glorious day for our country and indeed the world. And now of course the- wait a minute. What's this? Oh. Uh oh. Something is going terribly wrong. The abbey is shaking violently	as explosions abound. The top- Yes, the top of the abbey is collapsing. The prince and the princess look on in horror. This is not the tradition. This is not tradition at all. A giant hole now blasted into the ceiling, debris falling down and crushing several spectators, which is also not the tradition for a royal Canadian wedding.  Bright beam of light shooting through the hole in the ceiling.  The princess now in some kind of... isometric cube.  This is certainly breaking with tradition now.
"
15,3,Ike,"Booo. NOOO!
"
15,3,Narrator,"Canadians in attendance cannot believe their eyes. Widespread panic.  The princess being... hoisted away. The little mushroom people of Nova Scotia, screaming with horror.  The prince is attempting to grab hold of the cube. The duke and the duchess of Calgary hiding behind the pews. This is indeed a horrible day for all of Canada, and therefore- and the pudding has just been knocked over! Oh, this does not go with tradition at all! The royal pudding now spilling all over the abbey as the princess is lifted up, up... And she's gone. The princess has been taken. This is indeed a horrible day for Canada, and therefore, the rest of the world.

"
15,3,Dental Floss,"Oh no! It's Tooth Decay.
"
15,3,Tooth,"He's gonna get us.

15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Now, now, Tooth Decay, your character is supposed to be mean and nasty. M'kay. Stop cryin'.  Nono. See, Tooth Decay can't be sad until Toothbrush and Dental Floss have gotten rid of him. You can't just start already sad; there's nowhere to go. Besides, there's no arc. M'kay. Oh for crying out loud! Alright, alright Tooth Decay, you just go home and sort yourself out! The rest of us will rehearse the finale again! And you'd better come back tomorrow with a different attitude, Tooth Decay! M'kay?! 
"
15,3,Anchor,"The tornado was said to be the deadliest in fifty six years. In other news, it's been twenty-four hours now and the Princess of Canada is still missing. All of Canada is in mourning as nationwide suicides abound.

15,3,Anchor,"A massive candlelight vigil was held last night, led by the Canadian band, Rush.
"
15,3,Geddy Lee,"And it seems to me you lived your life like a flower breaking wind.  Never knowing whom to count on... 
"
15,3,Anchor,"the Prince of Canada has said that-... uh-... Uh we have just received breaking news that the Canadian government now knows who took the princess. The Canadian Prime Ministries instructing all people of Canadian descent to go home and... open their box of faith.  Box of faith? What the fuck is that? 
"
15,3,Canadian PM,"Hello there, my noble, strong, fellow Canadians. If you are watching this film strip, then no doubt Canada is in grave danger. As you know, the very heart of Canada is the Royal Family. If you have been ordered to open your Box of Faith, then one or more of the Royal Family must be in peril. Or else you just opened your Box of Faith and are watching this without being told to, in which case you are a dick. If you have indeed been instructed to open the box, then this is a call to arms! All Canadians in fighting condition are asked to meet by the tree in Edmonton. In your Box of Faith you will find all the items you need: a location beacon, a first-aid kit, and a sandwich. You may eat the sandwich now. Good luck, Canadian citizen, and God help. All of Canada is relying on you.

15,3,Kyle,"Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?

"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Kyle Broflovski! Do you mind telling me where your brother is?!
"
15,3,Kyle,"...I don't know.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of dental hygiene without Tooth Decay?! We have two more days of tape, and then previews start on Monday! What am I supposed to do, Kyle?! You tell me!
"
15,3,Kyle,"Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Getting rid of Tooth Decay is what I'm tryin' to fuckin' do!  He's your brother, Kyle Broflovski! Okay! How are you going to fix this?!
"
15,3,Ugly Bob,"Hey. Hey there.  You going to Canada too?  What am I saying? Of course you're going to Canada. You're Canadian, sure enough. Open your Box of Faith, did you? Me too. They can't take our princess and get away with it. Mind if I sit down?  Soon as I heard the call there was no question I was gonna sign up. Didn't care how far away I was. I was gonna get to that rally point at the tree in Edmonton. Didn't know there were other Canadians living here in the U.S. I'm from Toronto originally, but everywhere I went people were terrified by my disfigurement. I have to wear this bag on my head because I'm hideously ugly. Had to move here to the United States. Here, people don't think I look ugly. They just think I look Canadian.  The name's Ugly Bob.
"
15,3,Tooth,"I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
"
15,3,Toothbrush,"I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
"
15,3,Cast,"Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. 
"
15,3,Kyle,"I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Hold it, hold it, stop!  What. The fuck. Was that?
"
15,3,Kyle,"I'm just doing the line.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"The audience is supposed to feel scared of tooth decay, Kyle! Hukay?! If Tooth Decay has no believability, then Tooth Past and Dental Floss have nothing to play against!
"
15,3,Kyle,"Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Oh you're trying! You call rolling your fat ass out on the stage and lazily blurting out your lines like a turtle takin' a shit, you call that tryin'?! This play is supposed to change  how people think, Kyle! Get it fucking right!  Pick it up from there!
"
15,3,Leader,"Brave Canadians! You have answered the call, and now we must face our greatest foe! The princess has been kidnapped, and we believe this to be the work of... the giant!
"
15,3,Ugly Bob,"Oh, the giant!
"
15,3,Canadian 1,"Oh, the giant, that's not good.
"
15,3,Leader,"We are attempting to attract the giant now, with a bowl of Kraft dinner.  When the giant arrives we will attack him with our guns, our swords, our- 
"
15,3,The Giant,"Fee fi fo fum! I smell Kraft dinner.
"
15,3,Canadian 2,"It's the giant!
"
15,3,Canadian 3,"Skod! 
"
15,3,Leader,"Give us back the princess, Scott!
"
15,3,Scott,"You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!
"
15,3,Leader,"You're a dick, Scott! You have always been... a dick! And then you got radiation poisoning in Ottowa and now you're a giant dick!
"
15,3,Scott,"No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!
"
15,3,Leader,"Just hand over the princess of Canada!
"
15,3,Scott,"Why would I take the princess of Canada?
"
15,3,Ike,"Because you're a giant dick.
"
15,3,Scott,"I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!
"
15,3,Leader,"Aw crap. Sorry everyone. Looks like we had some bad intel. Return to your homes! 
"
15,3,Ugly Bob,"Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh?
"
15,3,Scott,"What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!
"
15,3,Ugly Bob,"Who?
"
15,3,Scott,"The Native Canadians.
"
15,3,Ugly Bob,"The Native Canadians?
"
15,3,Scott,"There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.

15,3,Scott,"Let's get 'em! Let's fuck them up!  What? You're looking at me like I'm some sort of Eskimo racist! Well I'm not! Think about it! Before the noble white man arrived, Canada was populated with these snow monkeys! Who else would be pissed off enough at Canada to kidnap our royalty?!  Oh shit!
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Wokay, in fifteen fucking minutes you all are not gonna care about this anymore, so I'll just say what I need to say. That was the worst rehearsal we have ever had! We are two days away from opening and you're all fuckin' around!
"
15,3,Dental Floss,"That's because Tooth Decay sucks.
"
15,3,Dentist,"Yeah, that's right.
"
15,3,Toothpaste,"It's all Tooth Decay's fault.
"
15,3,Another kindergartner,"It's him.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Oh don't put this all on Tooth Decay!  Let me tell you something, Dental Floss! You're not as good as you fuckin' think you are! You're already acting like you're a star and we haven't even opened yet! OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES, DENTAL FLOSS! YOU'RE ABOUT TO BLOW YOUR SHOT!

"
15,3,Male,"Iyach danich Iyahachdashey. Etiapo kitte kihine.
"
15,3,Ugly Bob,"He says Eskimos do hate us Canadians, but that there's an even bigger thread to Canada who has the princess.
"
15,3,Male,"Oteacha hiya. Oteacha chihiyata honhahaha.
"
15,3,Ugly Bob,"He said the evil that took her wasn't Canadian at all, but a beast who preys upon people of all nationalities. They can lead us to the best, but we will have to destroy it.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"I don't know what the Goddamned problem is. Maybe you all don't know serious tooth decay is, maybe you all just don't give a fuck. You all probably think you can live your lives cavity-free, m'kay, never givin' two shits about the plaque that's building on your teeth. Kyle, you have single-handedly destroyed all that which I worked on for the past six years. And so I want you to know, Kyle, once and for all, why this whole ""dental hygiene"" thing is so important to me.  Two years ago, I lost my father to tooth decay. M'kay? He was an intelligent, hard-workin' man, and my whole family watched as tooth decay took him in the blink of an eye! You've been told to brush and to floss, but do you really know the importance behind it?!  DO YOU?!

15,3,Female,"Dolede'ne junagonehe ha'i aantah.

15,3,Scott,"Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours!

"
15,3,Ugly Bob,"Don't worry. If there's one thing eskimos are good at, it's finding things.
"
15,3,Scott,"Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!
"
15,3,Ike,"Stop being a dick, Scott!
"
15,3,Scott,"Oh, so now I'm a dick!
"
15,3,Ugly Bob,"Wait a minute.  Look! 
"
15,3,Princess,"AAAAAAH! 
"
15,3,Scott,"It's the princess!
"
15,3,Ike,"Princess! 
"
15,3,Cast,"Your teeth are your friends. They're friends in your mouth. Take care of your friends or they'll rot and fall out.
"
15,3,Dentist,"Visit your dentist. He is your friend too. 
"
15,3,Dental Floss,"And dental floss also is here to help you.
"
15,3,Kyle,"Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"FLAT! You're FLAT!
"
15,3,Scott,"There!
"
15,3,Princess,"Please, save me! You have to hurry! It wants to kill me!
"
15,3,Scott,"Who took you, Princess?!
"
15,3,Princess,"I should have listened! I didn't believe it was real! Oh God! It's behind you! 
"
15,3,Scott,"Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!
"
15,3,Tooth Decay,"I am Tooth Decay! Your teeth shall be mine!
"
15,3,Princess,"I should have always brushed and flossed and avoided sweets!
"
15,3,Scott,"Fart-loving tooth decay! I'll fix you! 
"
15,3,Female,"Bitchen junako. 
"
15,3,Princess,"Save me! Save me!
"
15,3,Ugly Bob,"It's coming for me! Help!
"
15,3,Princess,"Help! 
"
15,3,Ike,"Princess, look away!

15,3,Scott,"What the?  You did it, kid!
"
15,3,Female,"Washia hayub 'an.

"
15,3,Princess,"Oh, thank you! Thank you!
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"I want you all to take a serious fucking look at yourselves! M'kay?! Act I was pure fucking dogshit! If Tooth Decay is singin' flat, then the whole fuckin' thing sounds flat! Wuhkay?!
"
15,3,Sgt. Yates,"Mr. Mackey? Mr. Mackey!  We're putting a stop to this play! It's over.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"What?! Why?! Don't worry, I will be better! These kids just aren't listenin' to me!
"
15,3,Sgt. Yates,"No. it's over! They got him, Mr. Mackey. Tooth Decay. They got the sonofabitch.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"What?
"
15,3,Officer,"Up in the Yukon. All bureause are confirming it.
"
15,3,Sgt. Yates,"You can let it go, Mackey. Tooth Decay is gone.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Oho... Oh God... Go on home, kids. M'kay? It's over!
"
15,3,Toothbrush,"What?
"
15,3,Narrator,"The princess now giving the Canadian Medal of Courage to Ugly Bob, and also to Scott, who is of course a giant dick, aaand Katuktuk of the Yukon. And the medal of course made of white chocolate, as is tradition. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. The duke of Calgary standing up and putting on a fake beard, a tradition passed down since the birth of Canada. The princess now knighting Sir Ike Broflovski, giving him three kisses and a pair of socks, as is tradition.
"
15,3,Kyle,"I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. 
"
15,3,Stan,"My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
"
15,3,Cartman,"My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
"
15,3,Kyle,"Hmmm, yeah.
"
15,3,Narrator,"And now the scraping off of the pudding.
"
15,3,Narrator,"And now the scraping off of the pudding.  Isn't she beautiful, scraping off the pudding with the grace of a butterfly. She rubs the pudding on her face.  The prince now attempting to remove one of the princess's arms. As is of course the tradition. The princess screaming with pain. Everyone watching with anticipation.  And the arm is off! Things are back to normal here in Canada. Time-honored traditions are once again-  yehhss, the prince is sticking the princess's arm up his ass. There it goes.  He's really making a good go of it. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore of course, the world.
"
15,4,Butters,"And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
"
15,4,Kyle,"...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
"
15,4,Butters,"Skeletor is real??
"
15,4,Stan,"No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
"
15,4,Butters,"Skeletor's a lady??
"
15,4,Cartman,"Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!
"
15,4,Butters,"Hey Eric.
"
15,4,Cartman,"I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!
"
15,4,Kyle,"You get in trouble again, Cartman?
"
15,4,Cartman,"No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
"
15,4,Stan,"Dude we're, we're just trying to eat.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!
"
15,4,Stan,"Yeah.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
"
15,4,Kyle,"No they didn't.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
"
15,4,Stan,"Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
"
15,4,Cartman,"Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
"
15,4,Kyle,"That doesn't make any sense.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Go look for yourselves!!
"
15,4,Cartman,"There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
"
15,4,Butters,"Is that really all our wiener sizes?
"
15,4,Cartman,"Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: ""Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches""!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
"
15,4,Craig,"Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.
"
15,4,Butters,"Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?
"
15,4,Kyle,"How big do they say mine is? 
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
"
15,4,Mr. Mackey,"You're right. They, they really seem into it, m'kay. 
"
15,4,Stan,"Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
"
15,4,Cartman,"No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
"
15,4,Butters,"A conspiracy?
"
15,4,Cartman,"They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
"
15,4,Kyle,"Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
"
15,4,Clyde,"Alright.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 
"
15,4,Butters,"Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
"
15,4,Butters,"Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
"
15,4,Cartman,"Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
"
15,4,Butters,"Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
"
15,4,Cartman,"Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
"
15,4,Butters,"I'm hung like a horse!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?
"
15,4,Kyle,"Didn't you forget something?
"
15,4,Cartman,"What, Kyle?
"
15,4,Kyle,"You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
"
15,4,Cartman,"I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. 
"
15,4,Kyle,"Thirteen point seven inches?
"
15,4,Cartman,"Yeah, it's pretty good.
"
15,4,Kyle,"Your wiener is not 13 inches long!
"
15,4,Stan,"You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
"
15,4,Stan,"You just did that to everybody in class!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! 
"
15,4,Stan,"Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup. 
"
15,4,Millie,"Actual boys' penis sizes?
"
15,4,Nelly,"Gross!
"
15,4,Cartman,"There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Oh, Goddamnit!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"You're darn right, Eric!
"
15,4,Cartman,"For what?!
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"What?
"
15,4,Cartman,"I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?
"
15,4,Cartman,"You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"The numbers we put up were height differentials. 
"
15,4,Cartman,"What?
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Those weren't our dick sizes?
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?
"
15,4,Cartman,"I don't know! Why would you?!
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"We didn't!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"Because you have an anger problem, Eric!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Fuck you! No I don't!
"
15,4,Doctor,"What we need to figure out here is, are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism? Some rage addiction? It could be a lot of things.
"
15,4,Liane,"My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
"
15,4,Doctor,"Let's try a little experiment. I wanna see maybe what kind of things... trigger you, Eric. Okay? How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
"
15,4,Cartman,"Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
"
15,4,Doctor,"What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat? I think you're a fat little boy. I think you're waaaaay too fat for your age. Does that make you feel any anger? Huh, fatty? Jelly-belly? You got jelly in your belly you little fat fuck? You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you've got tits like a 40-year-old woman? Fat boy?!  Huh?! You like that, shitty-titty jelly-belly?!  Oh yeah, he's a big boy!! Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass!! Big old jiggly fatty butt!!  ...Huh. Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman. Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all. In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even-tempered children I've ever seen.
"
15,4,Receptionist,"Sorry Doctor, your wife's on the phone? Says it's an emergency. 
"
15,4,Doctor,"Excuse me.  Carol, what? ...Whoa, calm down honey. What do you mean? Web chat with wha-? What 14-year-old girl? Carol, I would ne-  No I don't have a criminal record. Who would- Who is Mitch Conner?! There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no- No no, Carol, put down the gun, swee- uh sweetie, come on, put down the  Carol? Carol! 
"
15,4,Cartman,"I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
"
15,4,Randy,"Oh dear.
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.
"
15,4,Randy,"Did they measure from the base or from the balls? 
"
15,4,Mrs. Stevens,"How does the school let things like this happen??
"
15,4,Principal Victoria,"Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
"
15,4,Randy,"I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.
"
15,4,Randy,"Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.
"
15,4,Girl with Brown Coat,"They have sex?
"
15,4,Randy,"Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.
"
15,4,Doctor,"I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
"
15,4,Bodybuilder,"We didn't make any effort, we didn't have a choice!
"
15,4,Tea Bag Participant,"Yeah! This is bullshit!
"
15,4,Doctor,"Together, we're gonna learn what makes us angry, okay? And how to better deal with it so we don't get ourselves into trouble anymore.
"
15,4,Michael,"So lame! Why doesn't everyone just die?!
"
15,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"Rook! Ifuh somebody ordereduh shitty beef, anduh complain because they say they ordereduh shitty shrimp, It's notuh my fault he gets the shitty chicken poured all over hisuh fucking head!
"
15,4,Tea Bag Participant,"We have good reason to be angry! This country is going to shit! We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone, and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
"
15,4,Doctor,"Right. See, what we all need to do is chaaannel our various reasons for anger, and learn to control it.
"
15,4,Wigger,"Man, this shit wack, manh. I just see all this shit fummah. I'm in the stands like pozze no fuckin' good manh. Bitch be callin me tappin that shit, man.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Why the fuck am I here?!
"
15,4,Doctor,"Well, Eric, because I know you want to... control your anger and become a better person.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
"
15,4,Doctor,"NO No, I'm not saying that, at all. Please I, I'm just saying how a-, amazing you are for wanting to... l-lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Oh, that's cool.
"
15,4,Randy,"And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.
"
15,4,Girl with Blue Vest,"What's a penis?
"
15,4,Randy,"...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud
"
15,4,Riley,"Example 1: Randy has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
"
15,4,Randy,"Four point four inches...
"
15,4,Riley,"Its angle is 32 degrees. Its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter. His balls are seven centimeters from the base.
"
15,4,Randy,"Seven centimeters...
"
15,4,Riley,"Randy notes that the drift of his penis is four centimeters to penis right, and its dead weight is .5 kilograms.
"
15,4,Randy,"Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person ""Randy"" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. 
"
15,4,Doctor,"Okay, what we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger. Daniel, could you stand up please?  What makes you the angriest, Daniel?
"
15,4,Daniel,"Stupid-ass blind liberals!
"
15,4,Doctor,"Okay, great. Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid-ass blind liberal?  And what makes you angriest, Chase?
"
15,4,Chase,"Scrawny-ass sissies!
"
15,4,Doctor,"Okay, Daniel's a scrawny-ass sissy, he just cut in front of you in line at the bank. Go!
"
15,4,Chase,"Hey! What, do you think I got a small dick?! Huh?! 
"
15,4,Daniel,"Huh I don't have a small penis! My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
"
15,4,Doctor,"...Okay. Uh, why don't we uh do some roleplaying now with Wayne D, who gets angriest at his mom.  Gretchen, can you play Wayne D's mom for us? 
"
15,4,Wayne D,"Yo, bitch! You think you bad? Just 'cause you're a mom don't mean I can't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mang!
"
15,4,Gretchen,"I may be female on the outside, but I still have a bigger penis than you!
"
15,4,Wayne D,"I don't have a small penis! Don't say that, it isn't true! It isn't true!
"
15,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"That's enough! I've beem sick of everyone talk aboutuh penis shize!
"
15,4,Daniel,"Yeah, it doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!
"
15,4,Doctor,"Does... everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
"
15,4,Chase,"No.
"
15,4,Gretchen,"No.
"
15,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"Not me.
"
15,4,Daniel,"Nnnooo.
"
15,4,Wayne D,"No, my, my shit be packing, manh.
"
15,4,Cartman,"My penis is 13 inches long.
"
15,4,Doctor,"Hmmm.
"
15,4,Guest Speaker,"Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnod, and I'm an ""actual doctor"" of human sexuality and behavior. Unfortunately you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days, and I am here to set things straight.
"
15,4,Wendy,"Thank God.
"
15,4,Ms. Turnod,"I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually  Length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width- 
"
15,4,Randy,"Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE 
"
15,4,Doctor,"We all want to welcome our new member, Randy. Say hi to everyone, Randy.
"
15,4,Randy,"Aw, suck it! All o'ya!
"
15,4,Doctor,"Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy. Why don't you share what's bothering you?
"
15,4,Randy,"You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
"
15,4,Daniel,"Goddamn right! Socialist fascist!
"
15,4,Randy,"Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!
"
15,4,Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, this is what we're here to try and work on, okay?
"
15,4,Randy,"No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!
"
15,4,Doctor,"If you take a minute to think about your anger, and give-  whoa! Whoawhoawhoa!
"
15,4,Randy,"Yeeaahh!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Yeah dude!
"
15,4,Wayne D,"Man, that shit be burnin' an' shit, manh!
"
15,4,Gretchen,"Yeeaahh!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
15,4,Randy,"Yeeaahh! 
"
15,4,Clerk,"Welcome to FedEx. How can I help you today?
"
15,4,Customer,"Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
"
15,4,Clerk,"Alrighty, let's see what kind of-
"
15,4,Randy,"Burn it down! 
"
15,4,Cartman,"Burn it down, dude! 
"
15,4,Randy,"Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! 
"
15,4,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. They call themselves the pissed-off and angry party. And they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
"
15,4,Randy,"This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!
"
15,4,Field Reporter,"What exactly are you angry about?
"
15,4,Randy,"We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-
"
15,4,Cartman,"The Jews!
"
15,4,Randy,"Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!
"
15,4,Field Reporter,"You've got a lot of people scared. What are your demands?
"
15,4,Randy,"Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
"
15,4,Chase,"Yeeaahh!
"
15,4,Randy,"And we want-
"
15,4,Daniel,"And we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate!
"
15,4,Randy,"Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,
"
15,4,Wayne D,"And my mom gotta stop trippin', manh. Bitch be trippin' all the time, manh.
"
15,4,Randy,"Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?
"
15,4,Cartman,"No, and fuck Kyle!
"
15,4,Randy,"Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
"
15,4,Field Reporter,"Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the Federal Government?
"
15,4,Randy,"No. No, that doesn't matter!  Fuck, really?!
"
15,4,Linda,"Butters, what are you doing?
"
15,4,Butters,"Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 
"
15,4,Linda,"Your T.M.I.?
"
15,4,Butters,"I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 
"
15,4,Linda,"Butters, put your clothes on.
"
15,4,Butters,"Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
"
15,4,Linda,"Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? 
"
15,4,Driver 1,"Hey, everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America! Join the fight! 
"
15,4,Driver 2,"We're gonna take down the Federal Expresses, the American Apparels, and the American Furniture Warehouse! 
"
15,4,Driver 3,"We're fed up and we've had enough! 
"
15,4,Aide 1,"Surgeon general, twelve more FedExes have been taken over; the Pissed Off and Angry Party is gaining more support!
"
15,4,Aide 2,"They've shut down American Airlines and American Apparels all over the country. We have to ask you to step down.
"
15,4,Rebecca Turnod,"Are you seriously saying we're going to give in to their demands?
"
15,4,Aide 2,"They're all really angry. We have to make them stop. Is the team standing by to fuck that little boy Kyle?
"
15,4,Aide 3,"Team is standing by, sir.
"
15,4,Doctor,"'Scuse me. Excuse me, let me through.
"
15,4,Rebecca Turnod,"Who is this?
"
15,4,Doctor,"Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening. I have found a direct correlation between the anger, and T.M.I.  Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw.  Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry or always finding new reasons to be angry, it means they have a very very very very small dick.
"
15,4,Rebecca Turnod,"Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter. The T.M.I. equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed. There's nothing we can do about it.
"
15,4,Doctor,"Isn't there? Isn't... there?
"
15,4,Daniel,"We've waited long enough, Randy! Let's start killin' these sons of bitches!
"
15,4,Woman,"No, please!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
"
15,4,Wayne D,"Yo let's cap these bitches, manh! Let's cap an leave em at the back of the building, manh!
"
15,4,Michael,"Hey, come over here. Look. 
"
15,4,Announcer,"We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
"
15,4,Rebecca Turnod,"Fellow Americans, as you all know, the T.M.I. scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk. The established equation is a hundred percent accurate.
"
15,4,Randy,"Rrrr!
"
15,4,Daniel,"Shhh.
"
15,4,Rebecca Turnod,"However, due to recently collected data, we are making one change.  The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from 6 inches to 1.5 inches.  Anyone with a T.M.I. of over 1.5 inches is considered ""above average"". 
"
15,4,Randy,"The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Wait, what?
"
15,4,Randy,"America is back!
America is back!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
"
15,4,Randy,"We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!
"
15,4,Cartman,"I'm still fucking angry!
"
15,4,Randy,"Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!
"
15,5,Phillip,"That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance 
"
15,5,Kyle,"Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
"
15,5,Stan,"I know! This is awesome!
"
15,5,Kyle,"I'm so happy! 
"
15,5,Announcer,"Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these messages. 
"
15,5,Singer,"So much sufferin'... 
"
15,5,Kyle,"Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
"
15,5,Stan,"What?
"
15,5,Kyle,"Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! 
"
15,5,Sarah McLachlan,"These are images of babies born addicted to crack cocaine. Their mothers have abandoned them. They lie in the dark, crying, with nobody to hold them.
"
15,5,Stan,"Aw dude, that's so sad. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"Why do they have to put this on TV?! 
"
15,5,Sarah McLachlan,"Their world is bleak, lonely, and hopeless.  Hello, I'm Sarah McLachlan, and I was famous for two months. Each year, thousands of babies are born addicted to crack and lie in hospitals without a mother to hold them.  Won't you volunteer today? Look at these pictures. They need you.
"
15,5,Stan,"Awww dude, awwww.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Aaaggh, God.
"
15,5,Sarah McLachlan,"Please. Go to your local hospital now. Here are some more pictures. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! 
"
15,5,Nurse,"It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.
"
15,5,Kyle,"What exactly can I do to help?
"
15,5,Nurse,"Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now.  I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Oh it's, it's so sad.
"
15,5,Nurse,"Come, come, right over here.  We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"Oh. Hey Kyle.
"
15,5,Kyle,"What are you doing here?
"
15,5,Cartman,"I'm volunteering.
"
15,5,Kyle,"...What are you doing here?!
"
15,5,Cartman,"I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.
"
15,5,Nurse,"Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Why do you have a video camera?
"
15,5,Cartman,"I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. 
"
15,5,Ms. Williams,"Bye, Eric. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
"
15,5,Ms. Williams,"Certainly. We're... here all the time, unfortunately.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Thanks. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"What's going on?!
"
15,5,Butters,"Wuuuuhhhhhh! 
"
15,5,Cartman,"Ah, crap! 
"
15,5,Cartman,"Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
"
15,5,Kyle,"So what are you doing?!
"
15,5,Cartman,"What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Alright, what is it?!
"
15,5,Cartman,"Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!
"
15,5,Kyle,"Why do you need me?
"
15,5,Cartman,"Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!
"
15,5,Kyle,"I knew you were doing something terrible!
"
15,5,Cartman,"What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
"
15,5,Kyle,"Lots of people will when I tell them!
"
15,5,Cartman,"We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"You what?
"
15,5,Cartman,"Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
"
15,5,Kyle,"A thousand dollars.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
"
15,5,Cartman,"After you. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"There's a big wait to sit down.
"
15,5,Waiter,"Ah, Mr. Cartman. We have your table waiting, sir.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Come on. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Jesus Christ.
"
15,5,Craig,"It's awesome.
"
15,5,Cartman,"It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
"
15,5,Butters,"Every single night.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Wow...
"
15,5,Cartman,"We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
"
15,5,Butters,"I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now
"
15,5,Cartman,"You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
"
15,5,Kyle,"And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. 
"
15,5,Stan,"Go long, Token! Go go! 
"
15,5,Kyle,"Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.
"
15,5,Stan,"Wow, really? 
"
15,5,Kyle,"I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.
"
15,5,Stan,"Doing what?
"
15,5,Kyle,"Crack baby... basketball.
"
15,5,Stan,"...Dude.
"
15,5,Kyle,"No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?
"
15,5,Cartman,"Betsy MacIntosh?
"
15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"Whatta you want?
"
15,5,Cartman,"We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
"
15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"Oh Gohhhd.
"
15,5,Cartman,"We need to speak with you, ma'am. 
"
15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"It's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until I use again.
"
15,5,Cartman,"And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
"
15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"I don't want my baby born addicted to drugs! But I can't stop! 
"
15,5,Cartman,"Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. 
"
15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"The what?
"
15,5,Cartman,"We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?
"
15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"They said it's a boy.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
"
15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"How much will he make?
"
15,5,Cartman,"Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.
"
15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"So what? You would make money off of my child? That doesn't seem fair.
"
15,5,Cartman,"I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-
"
15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"Cain't you change the rules?
"
15,5,Cartman,"Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 
"
15,5,Kyle,"Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? 
"
15,5,Stan,"...You sound like Cartmam.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!
"
15,5,Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.
"
15,5,Kyle,"I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
"
15,5,Clyde,"We're just having a hard time finding him.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.
"
15,5,Kyle,"I need to talk to you. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?
"
15,5,Kyle,"In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
"
15,5,Cartman,"They can't make money. It's against the rules.
"
15,5,Kyle,"But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Gut they're the ones risking injury.
"
15,5,Cartman,"What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
"
15,5,Kyle,"The government could come after us, Cartman.
"
15,5,Cartman,"We're a non-profit company, Kyle.
"
15,5,Kyle,"So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
"
15,5,Cartman,"Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"A hot tub?!
"
15,5,Cartman,"It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"Gravy?
"
15,5,Cartman,"Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
"
15,5,Kyle,"No way.
"
15,5,Cartman,"A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutaine"".
"
15,5,Kyle,"I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
"
15,5,Cartman,"It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
"
15,5,Kyle,"What other companies?
"
15,5,Secretary,"Dean Howland, a representative from another prestigious institution is here to see you.
"
15,5,Dean Howland,"A what? Send him in. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
"
15,5,Dean Howland,"In the what?
"
15,5,Cartman,"My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.
"
15,5,Dean Howland,"I have... no idea what you're talkin' about.
"
15,5,Cartman,"You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.
"
15,5,Dean Howland,"Are you referring to our student athletes?
"
15,5,Cartman,"Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then?
"
15,5,Dean Howland,"Look, there are  good reasons why our student athletes cannot be paid, young man.
"
15,5,Cartman,"I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?
"
15,5,Dean Howland,"We do  not own slaves, and we have no desire to own slaves.
"
15,5,Cartman,"But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.
"
15,5,Dean Howland,"Get out! This is a prestigious university and I am not saying one more word to you!
"
15,5,Cartman,"You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! 
"
15,5,Kyle,"Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!
"
15,5,Stan,"McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
"
15,5,Kyle,"It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 
"
15,5,Cartman,"How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!
"
15,5,Clyde,"We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.
"
15,5,Cartman,"How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
"
15,5,Clyde,"We don't know. He's everywhere.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
"
15,5,Craig,"Oh, that's a good idea.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!
"
15,5,Kyle,"Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.
"
15,5,Cartman,"...What?
"
15,5,Kyle,"I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!
"
15,5,Cartman,"Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!
"
15,5,Kyle,"...What?
"
15,5,Cartman,"This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our ""student athletes"" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! 
"
15,5,Postmaster,"Let me get this straight. You kids want me to tell you where Slash lives?
"
15,5,Craig,"Please sir, it's very important.
"
15,5,Postmaster,"Well I'm afraid I can't do that, kids.
"
15,5,Clyde,"But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.
"
15,5,Postmaster,"Come on! Kids write to Slash every day, but it all just goes into this big pile over here.  The reason I can't tell you where Slash lives is because he don't live nowhere. Don't you ever wonder how Slash can be aaall those places at the same time? It's because he's made up! He-
"
15,5,Postman,"Don't spoil it for the kids, Marty. It's up to parents to tell their children Slash ain't real. 
"
15,5,Roger,"Hullo?
"
15,5,Clyde,"Dad, is Slash real or make-believe?
"
15,5,Roger,"Ohh dear. Clyde's asking about Slash.
"
15,5,Betsy,"Oooo well, the day had to come.
"
15,5,Roger,"Clyde, the truth is Slash isn't a person. He's more like a... feeling in your heart, you know?
"
15,5,Clyde,"Slash isn't real.
"
15,5,Craig,"Get out of here.
"
15,5,Betsy,"Clyde, sometimes people like to pretend with make-believe characters. He's not really a lie, he's like ahh...
"
15,5,Roger,"Er he's like love. People all over the world dress up like Slash and have different names for Slash. The Dutch call him Vunter Slash.
"
15,5,Clyde,"He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.
"
15,5,Roger,"Your mother's Dutch, you know, Clyde. Ha- how did that old folk song go, honey?
"
15,5,Betsy,"Vunter Slash kapunshka
"
15,5,Both Parents,"Shpielerin manshunshka
"
15,5,Kyle,"And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?
"
15,5,Clyde,"You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"What?
"
15,5,Craig,"Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.
"
15,5,Butters,"Slash is make-believe??
"
15,5,Clyde,"Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"Vunter Slash?
"
15,5,Kyle,"What?
"
15,5,Cartman,"But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?
"
15,5,Clyde,"One of our parents.
"
15,5,Cartman,"But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?
"
15,5,Clyde,"One of our parents!
"
15,5,Cartman,"Are you fucking serious? 
"
15,5,Stan,"You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"You knew about this??
"
15,5,Stan,"My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 
"
15,5,Butters,"Well what the heck do we do now?
"
15,5,Kyle,"Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!
"
15,5,Mr. Peters,"Boys, I want to thank you for bringin' the CB double A franchise here to EA Sports. You've made us a lohhht of monih.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
"
15,5,Mr. Peters,"Yes, our lawyers are damn good. But you didn't get nothin'. Why you boys got experience, didn'tcha? You got a chance to play in the big leagues. Sure, we here at EA might have made all the monih, but you little workers had a chance to make some'in' of yourselves. I'd give you some free video games, but it's against the rules. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
"
15,5,Mr. Peters,"Oh, well, fuck 'em. And fuck you too. I piss in your faces. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"I just can't believe Slash isn't real,
"
15,5,Butters,"I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
"
15,5,Kyle,"You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
"
15,5,Cartman,"I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.
"
15,5,Mr. Peters,"Well boys, this has been real educational and all, but now let's part with that old EA Sports sayin': ""Get the fuck out of my buildin'!""
"
15,5,Kyle,"It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!
"
15,5,Stan,"It's what?
"
15,5,Kyle,"This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?
"
15,5,Ms. Williams,"Isn't it wonderful? All the crack babies will have a home now.
"
15,5,Kyle,"But who paid for all this? 
"
15,5,Stan,"Kyle, Kyle! Look. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
"
15,5,Stan,"Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
"
15,5,Child singers,"Vunter Slash kapunshka. Shpielerin manshunshka. Het mine gaset rosa. Danka Vunter Slasha
"
15,5,Cartman,"He is real, you guys.

15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"What's the big idea putting your Shitty Sushi right next to my Shitty Wok?!
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"I'm sorry I do not understand your accent. You want a Shitty tuna roll?
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"No I don't want Shitty tuna roll! I want you to go find another shitty town to open your Shitty Sushi prace!
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Why don't you please ujust speak Engrish? Maybe I can understand you!

15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Better than Shitty Kung Pao Chicken made from cat! 
"
15,6,Steven,"Hello?
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"Sir, does this mailman belong to you?
"
15,6,Stephen,"That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it.
"
15,6,Stephen,"What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!
"
15,6,Butters,"But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
"
15,6,Stephen,"Don't talk back to me! 
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"We'll send a bill for the damages,  but in the meantime, please keep a closer eye on your child, sir? 
"
15,6,Stephen,"Go up to your room, now! 
"
15,6,Linda,"What's going on?
"
15,6,Stephen,"Butters started an Asian turf war!
"
15,6,Linda,"Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?
"
15,6,Stephen,"I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda.
"
15,6,Stephen,"Well Dr. Janus?
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder.
"
15,6,Linda,"What?
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"There are several distinct personalities going on in there. One is named ""Postman Butters"" and yet another is ""Fireman Butters."" And then there's even ""Inspector Butters"" and uh, ""Professor Chaos"".
"
15,6,Linda,"Oh my God!
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"From what I gather, he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when he's outside playing. Sometimes he's a cowboy and other times he's an Indian, and the two seem to be at constant odds.
"
15,6,Linda,"Oh, poor Butters!
"
15,6,Stephen,"Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"No, I don't think grounding him would do much good at this point.  What your son needs now is lots of tender loving... medication. Heavy medication.
"
15,6,Field Reporter,"Tom, a brand new sushi place has opened in South Park, adding to our booming Asian district. With the addition of the new Chinese restaurant, townspeople are officially naming this whole Chinatown area ""Little Tokyo.""
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"What the fuuuck?!  You see what happen?!
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"I told you not to come in here!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Now everyone in town think a Chinese and a Japanese are the same fucking thing!
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"I don't even know what the fuck you are saying! Uhpupuh putuh peepee!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Aaah you Japanese racist! 
"
15,6,Linda,"Stephen! Stephen, come quick! It's butters!  Look!
"
15,6,Butters,"Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!
"
15,6,Linda,"Now he thinks he's a truck driver. 
"
15,6,Stephen,"Oh God the medication isn't working!
"
15,6,Butters,"It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. 
"
15,6,Stephen,"Butters! Butters!!  BUTTERRRRS!
"
15,6,Butters,"Oh hey Dad.
"
15,6,Stephen,"You're back. You're back-he's back!  I love you son!
"
15,6,Butters,"I love you too, Dad.
"
15,6,Stephen,"You're going to be okay Butters! You hear me?! YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY! 
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Youuu, get out! I told you not to come in here!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay, whoa, just hold a minute, hold a minute. I come ina peace.
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"I don't berieve you!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Come on, rook! All this fighting, it's just to sirry, you know? Chinese anda Japanese been fighting for so rong. It'sa ridicurous. What we need... is to have a tweaty.
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"What is tweaty?
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Nono, we need a tweaty.
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"A tweaty?
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"No, not a treaty, a tweaty!
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Oh, you mean a treaty?
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"What the fuck is a tweaty?
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"No no, a treaty.
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"A tweaty?  Rook rook. All these racist people thinka that a Chinese and a Japanese are the same, right? So you and me, we put on a big assembry for all the kids are school, and then everyone understand curtural difference. You know, so they know fried rice isn't from Japan and teriyaki isn't from China.
"
15,6,Customer,"Teriyaki isn't from China?
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"No, teriyaki isn't froma fucking China!
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Very well. I will do assembly with you.
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh really? Oh great.  Okay, I'll meet you tomorrow and we can go over our prans.  And when you get to that assembry, you gonna get big surprise, you Japanese dog.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Butters, when you were playing in the yard yesterday, do you remember becoming someone named... Big Rig Butters?
"
15,6,Butters,"Sure.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"What makes Big Rig Butters come out? Did somebody hurt him? Did he do something bad he can't forgive himself for?
"
15,6,Butters,"Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"You don't know. But, maybe somebody else in there does. Do you think it would be possible for me to speak with... Inspector Butters?
"
15,6,Butters,"Sure.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"I'm now speaking to the person known as Inspector Butters.
"
15,6,Butters,"Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Inspector Butters, what do you want?
"
15,6,Butters,"Uh, well, to solve mysteries.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"And is there someone else living with you, someone named... Professor Chaos?
"
15,6,Butters,"Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?
"
15,6,Butters,"What? Why would I do that?
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Who am I speaking to now?
"
15,6,Butters,"Me, Butters.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Ah, Butters. You're back.
"
15,6,Butters,"Sir, I'm confused.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"I know you are. This is going to sound scary, pal, but... you have people living inside your head. And some of them want to murder you.
"
15,6,Butters,"Really?
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Yes, I'm afraid you're a little sick. But it's okay, because together we're going to get you well.
"
15,6,Alias 1,"Don't listen to Dr. Janus! He's a mean old man and a big silly grown up.
"
15,6,Butters,"Pardon me?
"
15,6,Alias 1,"He's just a big old stick in the mud who doesn't like to play.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Don't mind him, Butters. Billy's a pretty messed up kid. He was molested by his uncles.
"
15,6,Psycho Janus,"Dr. Janus isn't going to be alive for long! I'm going to kill him!
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Now, what are the things that make you happy, Butters? What's the matter, Butters? Are you still with us? Is one of your other personalities trying to take over?
"
15,6,Billy,"Le's play Battleship! All hands on the poop deck!
"
15,6,Psycho Janus,"Your soul will bleed for eternity!
"
15,6,Alias 2,"You don't even know what sexy is, Mr. Harrison.
"
15,6,Alias 3,"That Big Red freshness lasts right through it!
"
15,6,Alias 4,"The horned toad says we should go to Mexico. 
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"What are you feeling, Butters? Are you nervous about your condition?
"
15,6,Butters,"Yes!
"
15,6,Butters,"This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
"
15,6,Butters,"Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
"
15,6,Butters,"Well goodnight for now.  Goodnight, Butters.
"
15,6,Butters,"Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 
"
15,6,Butters,"Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again!
"
15,6,Butters,"Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!
"
15,6,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, kids, today we have a special assembly, m'kay. Today we're going to learn about ""the diversity of Asian people."" Please welcome Mr. Lu Kim and Mr. Junichi Takiyama. 
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Ni hao ma, South Park Erementary?!
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Konnichiwa?!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"How are we arr feering?!  Hey, Mr. Takiyama, did you know that China and Japan are actually uh different countries?
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Oh, rearry?  Hey, that ruhight. If you ook at map, you can see.
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"This whoooore thing is China, and Japan is this riiittle bitty country over here. And that's why the Japanese always try anda take over China!
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"What?!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"The Japanese planned to kill people in Nanking! The only thing Japanese ruve more than killing people is killing themselves! Suicide rate in Japan sky-high!
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Fuck you!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"""Oh no, I'm a Japanese and I had a bad day! I think I'm gonna kill myself!""
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Oh, hello Butters. I wasn't expecting you till 5:30.
"
15,6,Butters,"Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Yes. did you catch something?
"
15,6,Butters,"Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Oh, so you're on to me, huh you little shit?!
"
15,6,Butters,"Huh?
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"What, Inspector butters figured out I set him up?!
"
15,6,Butters,"Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Oh come on! You think multiple personality disorder is real?! I've been using that to scam this town for seven years! Now I gotta get out of here, thanks to you! But I'm getting one last heist before I go, and you're gonna help me!
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Get in there! Move it, asshole!
"
15,6,Butters,"This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"They're all idiots! The vault! Get to the vault! Come on! Go! Movie it!  Get this on and get in that vault! That's where the real good are!   Torch that door, do you hear me?! I'll kill your parents! I'll kill your friends! I said get that fucking door open!
"
15,6,Butters,"I'm trying, sir! 
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Butters? Butters, what are you doing? What is that? A blowtorch? Put that down! You're having another episode!
"
15,6,Butters,"What?
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Butters. Your name is Butters! Try and remember!
"
15,6,Butters,"But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Oh boy, you've really done it this time. I know it's not your fault, but I'm sorry. I'm going to have to alert the authorities, pal.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"We have to try and understand that he can't help what he's doing, officer. He probably has no memory of it at all.
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"Well, at least everything is accounted for. Thank God you came when you did, Dr. Janus.
"
15,6,Steven,"Breaking into a store, Butters?! What are you?!
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son.
"
15,6,Steven,"Oh, we'll ground the shit out of him, detective. Thank you so much.
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Herro-o.
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"You get the fuck out of my place!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay, hold on, hold on, please! I'ma sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I admit it. I fucked you at the assembly. How about you and me together do an Asian Diversity festival?
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Get the fuck out before I call police!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Please, I admitting it, okay?I fucked you at assembly. There's no way around it. It was verrry sneaky. Kind of like Pearl Harbor. Okay? That was a little sneaky too, huh? Pearl Harbor kind of sneaky; I think we can all be a rittle sneaky sometimes, hm? But that sneaky Chinese man? He's gone! Okay? Okay, if we can have Asian Diversity festival, then we no longer have to deal witha ""recial stereotypes."" Prease.
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Against my better judgment, I will trust you one more time. But this time, you'd better not rub your hands together when you turn around to walk away.
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay, see you tomorrow.  And on that Asian Diversity day you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japanese dog. 
"
15,6,Butters,"That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Butters please! It's me, Billy! You've gotta help!  Please, Butters, I've tried to tell old Dr. Janus that we're in danger, but Dr. Janus doesn't rrealize thaere's a problem!  The mean man that lives in our head is trying to take over for good!
"
15,6,Butters,"Um, excuse me?
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"No no nonono! Don't call out for help!  He's got a gun.
"
15,6,Butters,"Wahh!
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"If you draw any attention he'll kill us!
"
15,6,Butters,"Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"No, you can't. But you know somebody who can. Inspector Butters.
"
15,6,Butters,"What??
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"You've got to become Inspector Butters again and help me find out what the mean man wants.
"
15,6,Butters,"No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"You don't understand! For some reason the mean man is getting stronger. You have to help me find out how to stop him! Please! 
"
15,6,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in the heart of South Park's Little Tokyo, where the multitude of our town's Chinese are putting on a festival. Both of them have gone all out to celebrate Asian culture. The owner of Shitty Wok has actually paid for what he calls ""a tower of peace.""  to symbolize harmony between the two restaurants
"
15,6,A Woman,"Mr. Takiyama, a note for you. 
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Konnichiwa, my fine Japanese friend. It's so great that Chinese and Japanese are finarry getting arong. We should take our picture together on top of the Tower of Peace. I'm up there waiting for you now.  Prease, come meet me on top of the Tower of Peace. It would be rearry nice.  Yesss, and when you get to the top of that tower you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japane- Oh, sorry. Anyway, see you on top of tower! 
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Dr. Janus sure has a big house, dudn't he? He's planning on hurting people; I just know it!
"
15,6,Butters,"It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"This is kinda fun. You're Inspector Butters and I'm your faithful assistant, Dr. Watson!
"
15,6,Butters,"Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Yeah!  Butteers, what are you doing in my house?
"
15,6,Butters,"Hah?
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Oh dear. It's okay, Butters. You just think you're Inspector Butters right now.
"
15,6,Butters,"Aw man.
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Come on, let's get you home.  Where are ya gon', Butters?
"
15,6,Butters,"Oh, come on!
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"You aren't leaving here, Inspector! None of you are!
"
15,6,Butters,"AAAAAAAAAAA!  AAAAAAAAAAA!
"
15,6,Dr. Janus,"Butters, come on! Try and come back to us!  You can't run forever!  Excuse me, did someone order a pizza?  Yes, that was me, but I'm a little busy at the moment. I'll be right back!  You'll never turn me in, Inspector Butters! You're dead!
"
15,6,Butters,"Waaaa! 
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"You wanna take over my Shitty Woookk?! Hory crap, what time is it?  Oh no, I'm rate! 
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"What took you so long?!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Yes, I'm afraid my Tower of Peace was a rittle bit of trickery, Mr. Japanese dog. I'm going to put an end to you, and everyone gonna think it's just because you did what Japanese people ruve doing most. ""No, don't do it! Don't kill yourself, prease!"" 
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Urgh. Fuck you! I'ma not trying to kill myself!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"""No, don't do it, prease!""  ""So much to rive for!"" 
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"This is South Park Police!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Porice?! How?!
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"We know the truth, Dr. Janus!
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"Thisa Chinise rat trying to kill me!
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"He's not Chinese! He's white!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"What the fuck you talkin' about?!
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"Your name is Dr. Janus!
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"You people crazy!  Listen to them! It's true!  Truth hurts, doesn't it, Janus!  Who are you people?! Why are you all here?!
"
15,6,Mr. Takiyama,"How could I ret myself berieve what man was a Chinese?! I have brought shame upon myself!  Nooooo, this is racist stereotaipuuu! 
"
15,6,Steven,"So you're telling us that Dr. Janus has been the owner of City Wok all this time?
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"That's right. Of all his multiple personalities, the strongest was Lu Kim. And we never would have known... if it hadn'ta been for Inspector Butters. 
"
15,6,Butters,"Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
"
15,6,Steven,"Yes Butters. Thanks to you, maybe Dr. Janus can get back to his real self.
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"Yes, I'm sure he could. But, then again,  does the world really need another therapist?
"
15,6,Steven,"Whattaya mean?
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"Well I mean, would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking he's Lu Kim forever? Now that City Sushi is gone, City Wok is the only Chinese restaurant left in town.
"
15,6,Desk Officer,"Oh yeah.
"
15,6,Black Officer,"Yeah. Let's just let him keep believing he's a Chinese man.
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"Done!
"
15,6,Other Officers,"Good! Alright! Alright! Yeah!
"
15,6,Blond Officer,"Detective, he's asking for a blanket. Is that alright?
"
15,6,Sgt. Yates,"Go ahead. We're gonna process him and get him back to the restaurant. 
"
15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Thank you.  ""Oooooo, I hate Japanese people! They try and shut down my Shitty Wok, but they never wiiiiill. They're probably all ratching me, the Japanese. Ret them! I'm not even gonan swat that fryyy. They'll see. And they'll say 'Wow, that Shitty Wok owner. Why, he wouldn't even harm a fryyyyy.'"" 
"
15,7,Boys,"Yay! 
"
15,7,Cartman,"Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
"
15,7,Butters,"Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 
"
15,7,Cartman,"Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
"
15,7,Liane,"Here you go, sweetie.
"
15,7,Cartman,"Yaaaay!
"
15,7,Kyle,"Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.
"
15,7,Liane,"Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too.  Otherwise, he gets a little upset.
"
15,7,Cartman,"What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Oh God...
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters.
"
15,7,Butters,"I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
"
15,7,Cartman,"Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox!  D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Here, this one's from me, Stan.
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh thanks, dude.
"
15,7,Cartman,"Stan's getting another present, Mom.
"
15,7,Liane,"Here you are, muffin. 
"
15,7,Cartman,"Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Yeah dude!
"
15,7,Sharon,"Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Yeah they're the best!
"
15,7,Sharon,"Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff.
"
15,7,Stan,"Mom, I'm 10 years old now.
"
15,7,Sharon,"I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.
"
15,7,Cartman,"Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
"
15,7,Randy,"Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
"
15,7,Sharon,"Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.
"
15,7,Randy,"Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?
"
15,7,Sharon,"Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!
"
15,7,Randy,"Tween Wave?
"
15,7,Sharon,"You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!
"
15,7,Randy,"Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?
"
15,7,Sharon,"This is different!
"
15,7,Randy,"...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
"
15,7,Sharon,"It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better.
"
15,7,Randy,"""Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber.""
"
15,7,Sharon,"Fine, Randy!  You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! 
"
15,7,Randy,"I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. 
"
15,7,Sharon,"Well, it sounds like crap, right?!
"
15,7,Randy,"Uh... NO I mean...  I like it.
"
15,7,Sharon,"Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!
"
15,7,Randy,"No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.
"
15,7,Sharon,"Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!
"
15,7,Randy,"It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! 
"
15,7,Anchorman,"It's called Tween Wave, and if you're a parent your kids are probably listening to it. A new music genre for the era from 2009 through 2012. or ""The Tweens."" Every generation has their music, but many parents say Tween Wave sounds like crap.
"
15,7,Man 1,"It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good.
"
15,7,Woman 1,"This sounds like poo.
"
15,7,Man 2,"I certainly don't understand kids' music today. Sounds like diarrhea to me.
"
15,7,Anchorman,"Kids however say they don't hear crap at all.
"
15,7,Kid 1,"Parents are dumb.
"
15,7,Kid 2,"They don't get it.
"
15,7,Kid 1,"They don't get it. Parents are stupid.
"
15,7,Kid 3,"Tween Wave is swick.
"
15,7,Kid 4,"Tweem Wave is super swick and parents don't get it, 'cause their ears are old.
"
15,7,Kid 5,"Parents are dumb.
"
15,7,Sharon,"We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.
"
15,7,Randy,"Ugh, that's so unfair!
"
15,7,Kyle,"But that's our music! We like it!
"
15,7,Randy,"Yeah it's good!
"
15,7,Sheila,"What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?
"
15,7,Stan,"We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
"
15,7,Randy,"Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.
"
15,7,Gerald,"I wanna educate you kids with some real music.  This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. 
"
15,7,The Boys,"Yuck!
"
15,7,Randy,"What?
"
15,7,Stan,"That sounds like shit!
"
15,7,Gerald,"Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Gross!
"
15,7,Cartman,"Turn it off dude!
"
15,7,Sharon,"Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you.
"
15,7,Stan,"I know, Mom. I love you too.
"
15,7,Sharon,"Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff.
"
15,7,Stan,"It's okay, Mom. I understand.
"
15,7,Sharon,"That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie. 
"
15,7,Stan,"'Night.  Haha.  Ugh.  What the hell? 
"
15,7,Kyle,"Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! 
"
15,7,Cartman,"Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer. 
"
15,7,Kyle,"Hey Stan. 
"
15,7,Stan,"Hey dudes.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.
"
15,7,Stan,"Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Sure.  What's up?
"
15,7,Stan,"Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.
"
15,7,Stan,"No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Why? What's it sound like?
"
15,7,Stan,"It... kind of sounds like shit.
"
15,7,Kyle,"What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?
"
15,7,Stan,"No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?
"
15,7,Kyle,"No.
"
15,7,Stan,"That doesn't sound like shit to you?
"
15,7,Kyle,"NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.
"
15,7,Stan,"And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.
"
15,7,Doctor,"Uh huh, and what about food? Are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now, too?
"
15,7,Stan,"Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
"
15,7,Doctor,"This says you had a birthday recently?
"
15,7,Stan,"I just turned 10.
"
15,7,Doctor,"Well, that makes sense. You see Stan, as you get older, your eardrums, taste buds, all that stuff develops and changes.
"
15,7,Stan,"So this is normal?
"
15,7,Doctor,"It's very normal. Let's just do a quick ear exam. I'm gonna play some Tween Wave music and you tell me what you hear.  What's that sound like to you?
"
15,7,Stan,"Sounds like shit.
"
15,7,Doctor,"Aha. Now I'm going to play you some good ole Bob Dylan. 
"
15,7,Stan,"Uh that sounds like shit too.
"
15,7,Doctor,"Wait, this sounds like shit to you?
"
15,7,Stan,"Yeah dude, it's just shit.
"
15,7,Doctor,"Well that's very strange.  Hm, I'm gonna try somethin' else.  Look at these two pictures. One of them is an ad for Kevin James' new movie The Zookeeper, and the other is a turd in a microwave. Which one is the ad for The Zookeeper?
"
15,7,Stan,"They both look the same. 
"
15,7,Doctor,"You don't see any difference in the pictures?
"
15,7,Stan,"No.
"
15,7,Doctor,"That is an ad for The Zookeeper and  that is a turd about to be reheated.
"
15,7,Stan,"They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
"
15,7,Doctor,"Oh dear. I think I know what this is. You see Stan, as you get older, things that you used to like start looking and sounding like shit. And things that seemed shitty as a child don't seem as shitty. With you, somehow, the wires have gotten crossed and everything looks and sounds like shit to you. It's a condition called ""being a cynical asshole.""
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh no.
"
15,7,Doctor,"Yes. And there's no known cure, I'm afraid. Everything just seems shitty, and everyone starts to seem shitty, and everything they say just starts to 
"
15,7,Sharon,"Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?
"
15,7,Randy,"Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
"
15,7,Sharon,"Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!
"
15,7,Randy,"No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh. 
"
15,7,Sharon,"Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called ""getting older"", Randy. It's okay.
"
15,7,Randy,"That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!
"
15,7,Sharon,"It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!
"
15,7,Randy,"Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
"
15,7,Randy,"Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!  I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow  I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. 
"
15,7,Bar Patron,"You suck!
"
15,7,Randy,"No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! 
"
15,7,Janitor/Farmer 1,"Did you know we're livin' in the Tween time?
"
15,7,Farmer 2,"Nah, I'd a heard that.
"
15,7,Janitor/Farmer 1,"Guess it's the period between 2009 and 2013. They call it the Tweens. So they got this feller down at the bowling alley? He gets up on the stage an' shits his britches.
"
15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"What fer?
"
15,7,Janitor/Farmer 1,"I don't know. But he gets up there and strums a gueetar and then starts loadin' his britches up like it's goin' out of style.  It's like some kind of britches holocaust. Feller calls himself Steamy Ray Vaughn.
"
15,7,Farmer 2,"You mean that guy that plays the blues and died in an airplane crash?
"
15,7,Janitor/Farmer 1,"Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.
"
15,7,Cartman,"Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
"
15,7,Kenny,"(Get him!)
"
15,7,Kyle,"Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
"
15,7,Cartman,"He's lying, dude. Hit X
"
15,7,Kenny,"(No, he's telling the truth) 
"
15,7,Stan,"Hey guys.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?
"
15,7,Stan,"He said I have cynicism?
"
15,7,Kyle,"What's that?
"
15,7,Stan,"Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.
"
15,7,Stan,"Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
"
15,7,Cartman,"Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Yeah, we got him!
"
15,7,Stan,"How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
"
15,7,Kenny,"(Hit the X button, Kyle!)
"
15,7,Kyle,"We're gonna level up to detective!
"
15,7,Stan,"That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?
"
15,7,Stan,"Aw, dude, this looks like shit.
"
15,7,Kyle,"You don't wanna eat it?
"
15,7,Stan,"It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
"
15,7,Cartman,"Look like ice cream to me.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
"
15,7,Stan,"Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?
"
15,7,Stan,"What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
"
15,7,Randy,"City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much 
"
15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"Lord, I ain't never seen britches take a whoopin' like that.
"
15,7,Janitor/Farmer 1,"I told you. Them britches don't stand a chance.
"
15,7,Randy,"City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.
"
15,7,Steamy Nicks,"Thank you, thank you so much. 
"
15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"Wait now, who's that lady?
"
15,7,Janitor/Farmer 1,"That there's Steamy Nicks.
"
15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"You mean that gal who played for Fleetwood Mac and wrote that song ""Landslide""?
"
15,7,Janitor/Farmer 1,"Nnooh, that's Stevie Nicks. Steamy Nicks just shits her britches. 
"
15,7,Randy,"Yoyoyo! 
"
15,7,Sharon,"Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!
"
15,7,Janitor/Farmer 1,"I agree. Why don't you leave them poor britches alone?
"
15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"Them britches have had enough!
"
15,7,Waitress,"All alone today?
"
15,7,Stan,"Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
"
15,7,Waitress,"Well, what can I get you?
"
15,7,Stan,"Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
"
15,7,Waitress,"A little young to be so pessimistic, aren't ya kid?
"
15,7,Stan,"Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. 
"
15,7,Kyle,"I know! That's so hilarious!
"
15,7,Stan,"I thought you guys were sick! 
"
15,7,Cartman,"...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. 
"
15,7,Stan,"Dude, you totally lied to me!
"
15,7,Kyle,"No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
"
15,7,Stan,"Where were you guys going?!
"
15,7,Kyle,"Alright dude, we were going to the movies.
"
15,7,Stan,"Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is ""that looks like shit"" and, and ""this is shitty!""
"
15,7,Stan,"You guys... don't wanna be around me?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
"
15,7,Stan,"Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.
"
15,7,Stan,"I won't say a word.
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh shit.
"
15,7,Stan,"Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 
"
15,7,Cartman,"Oh cool, the movie trailers!
"
15,7,Announcer,"Adam Sandler is Jack. Adam Sandler is Jill. 
"
15,7,Stan,"Awww God! 
"
15,7,Kyle,"Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
"
15,7,Stan,"Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.
"
15,7,Announcer,"This November, Adam Sandler shits in your eyes, ears, and mouth.  It's Adam Sandler in Pbbbbbt, rated Arg for pirates. Fuck you!
"
15,7,Cartman,"That looks pretty good.
"
15,7,Stan,"How can you say that looks good?!
"
15,7,Kyle,"Shhh, you're doing it again!
"
15,7,Announcer,"Jim Carrey has a bunch of turds in his apartment. 
"
15,7,Stan,"Ugh.
"
15,7,Cartman,"Stan, knock it off!
"
15,7,Stan,"But it's just crap.
"
15,7,Kyle,"No, they're penguins! Stop it!
"
15,7,Announcer,"It's Jim Carrey in Whatever, You'll Pay To Go See It. Fuck you! July 12.
"
15,7,Announcer,"The President of the United States... is a duck??  A duck is President and the whole country is goin' to the dogs.  Or whatever, the President is a dog.  Who cares? Coming June something. 
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh come on, people!
"
15,7,Kyle,"That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! 
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry.
"
15,7,Cartman,"No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
"
15,7,Stan,"Me?! Did you see that shit?!
"
15,7,Stan,"Hang on guys!
"
15,7,Cartman,"Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! 
"
15,7,Stan,"Kyle?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Dude, you've... you've changed.
"
15,7,Stan,"I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
"
15,7,Kyle,"No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- 
"
15,7,Randy,"You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!
"
15,7,Sharon,"Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!
"
15,7,Randy,"I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!
"
15,7,Sharon,"... You're 42 years old, Randy!
"
15,7,Randy,"I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!
"
15,7,Sharon,"Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!
"
15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"What do you suppose is goin' on in there?
"
15,7,Janitor/Farmer 1,"Sound like Steamy Ray Vaughn is goin' at it with his wife over Steamy Nicks.
"
15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"You... sure you wanna do this?
"
15,7,Janitor/Farmer 1,"We got to now, if their fightin' is our best chance tuh save them britches.
"
15,7,Sharon,"You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! 
"
15,7,Randy,"Why can't you ever just support me?!
"
15,7,Sharon,"Support what?! Another stupid dream of yours?!
"
15,7,Randy,"Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!
"
15,7,Sharon,"WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!
"
15,7,Randy,"Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! 
"
15,7,Sharon,"I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous.
"
15,7,Janitor/Farmer 1,"Come on britches, we're settin' you free.
"
15,7,Randy,"I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
"
15,7,Sharon,"I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me.
"
15,7,Randy,"You kind of seem shitty to me too.
"
15,7,Sharon,"People get older, Randy. People grow apart.
"
15,8,Big Harry,"Oh that's funny, that's real funny. Big Harry and Mike in the Morning talkin' about the new hit movie , a great comedy, starring  and .
"
15,8,Mike,"I saw the movie last night, Big Harry, and it made me laugh so hard! This movie's about a  heh, he was suddenly all like  Aw, man it's great!
"
15,8,Big Harry,"Big Harry and Mike in the Morning. We'll talk more about it but let's get to some music. The new Tween Wave band  with their song 
"
15,8,Announcer,"Coming this fall to Fox/CBS/FX. Jurassic Park and Lost in the same TV show!   Dinosaurs!  Lost Humans!  Future, yes! 
"
15,8,Sharon,"Stanley, eat your waffles. 
"
15,8,Kyle,"Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!
"
15,8,Kenny,"(Are you serious?!)
"
15,8,Cartman,"Yep!
"
15,8,Kyle,"That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
"
15,8,Kyle,"Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Wait what?
"
15,8,Kyle,"That's what they're talking about on the news!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
"
15,8,Kyle,"Yes!
"
15,8,Cartman,"You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
"
15,8,Kyle,"You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Okay, you're on, Jew! 
"
15,8,Mr. Garrison,"And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess. 
"
15,8,Butters,"Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
"
15,8,Mr. Garrison,"No. Butters, that's not how it works.
"
15,8,Officer Barbrady,"Mr. Garrison,  these three boys were caught playing hooky.
"
15,8,Cartman,"Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? 
"
15,8,Mr. Garrison,"Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later. Right now we're talking about vaginal warts.
"
15,8,Wendy,"This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?
"
15,8,Butters,"You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
"
15,8,Cartman,"That's right, it's a butt fungus.
"
15,8,Butters,"Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
"
15,8,Stan,"God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! 
"
15,8,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, Stan, you, you've gotta try and pull yourself out of this, m'kay? I know that... your parents recently got divorced. M'kay, that's gotta be hard. I know that's... that's bad. But when you walk around all mopey, m'kay, and sayin' everything is... just shitty, well, that's called bein' a Debbie Downer, Stan. And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay. ...I mean you've gotta, you've gotta snap out of it, Debbie. Come on, Debbie, you're even bummin' me out now, m'kay? Your attitude just- just sucks.
"
15,8,Stan,"I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
"
15,8,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, well, that's not gonna happen, Debbie. Okay, you know, uh life, life has to change, m'kay?
"
15,8,Stan,"How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? 
"
15,8,Mr. Mackey,"Huh... e-excuse me a minute, Stan. m'kay?  Uh, hi, Ms. Bronski? Did we vaccinate Stan for the flu last year? We did? Uh oh... I think he's got Asperger's.
"
15,8,Announcer,"This is breaking news, from CNN! Or Fox or, whatever.  Fuck you.
"
15,8,Anchor,"The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's Syndrome from school vaccinations  has put the government in a tight spot.  At a press conference today the media heard from the young boy's father, Steamy Ray Vaughn.
"
15,8,Randy,"It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the ""government"" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a ""mentally incapacitated"" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!
"
15,8,Anchor,"In response to the embarrassment, the President of the United States has passed ""Stan's Bill,"" putting an end to school-mandated vaccinations.
"
15,8,Aide 1,"Mr. President, the bill is ready. 
"
15,8,Aide 2,"Just sign right here, Mr. President. 
"
15,8,Aide 1,"Aaand if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President. 
"
15,8,Anchor,"It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations, but if so, multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.
"
15,8,Cartman,"Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
"
15,8,Nurse Bronski,"Eric, what is it this time?
"
15,8,Cartman,"Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
"
15,8,Nurse Bronski,"You don't feel warm.
"
15,8,Cartman,"Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
"
15,8,Nurse Bronski,"Can you lay on your stomach?
"
15,8,Cartman,"I-I'll try. I'll try. 
"
15,8,Nurse Bronski,"What the?  What is this? A hamburger? 
"
15,8,Cartman,"A what??
"
15,8,Nurse Bronski,"Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
"
15,8,Cartman,"Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
"
15,8,Nurse Bronski,"This doesn't make sense. Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?
"
15,8,Cartman,"What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
"
15,8,Nurse Bronski,"Very funny!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
"
15,8,Nurse Bronski,"Get out of my office!
"
15,8,Wendy,"Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?
"
15,8,Kyle,"I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
"
15,8,Wendy,"I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.
"
15,8,Boy 1,"Those two should just screw and get it over with!
"
15,8,Boy 2,"Yeaahh...
"
15,8,Kyle,"I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
"
15,8,Wendy,"Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-
"
15,8,Kyle,"NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.
"
15,8,Cartman,"Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
"
15,8,Kyle,"What's the matter dude?
"
15,8,Cartman,"I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
"
15,8,Kyle,"You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.
"
15,8,Cartman,"Really?
"
15,8,Kyle,"Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.
"
15,8,Riley,"Wow. What is that?
"
15,8,Kyle,"Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Gee, thanks Kyle!
"
15,8,Researcher,"The truth is we still know very little about Asperger's syndrome, Mrs. Marsh. All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits.  Good morning Mr. Mathers.
"
15,8,Mr. Mathers,"Goodbye, doctor 
"
15,8,Researcher,"It's as if they all have an inability to distinguish from what is socially acceptable and what is not.  We've got a new patient, Martin. I want you to meet Stan.
"
15,8,Martin,"Nice to meet you.
"
15,8,Researcher,"Here at the treatment center, our focus is on awareness.  Asperger's is serious, but unfortunately because of its name people think it's a disease to be made fun of.  Alright everyone, let's have a seat.  Oh uh, we'll be done at about 5 pm, Mrs. Marsh. I'll call if it's any earlier.
"
15,8,Sharon,"Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you. 
"
15,8,Researcher,"Alright, are we clear?
"
15,8,Neo,"We're clear! 
"
15,8,Morpheus,"Watch that window, Puck!  Everyone, make sure this room isn't bugged!  Alright Stan, listen up! We don't have a lot of time! You've been told Asperger's is real! It isn't! It's just a front we use to stay hidden!
"
15,8,Stan,"Wait, it's not a real illness?
"
15,8,Morpheus,"Of course not! If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it Asperger's! That's just, that's just mean!  There's a big war going on out there, Stan, and we want you to join our fight to bring it all down!
"
15,8,Stan,"Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!
"
15,8,Morpheus,"You've broken through their reality and they don't like it! Others deserve to know the truth! You see everything as shit, don't you?!  Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music, all you see and hear is shit! Am I right?
"
15,8,Stan,"Yeah.
"
15,8,Neo,"So do we. All of us here. We know the truth too.
"
15,8,Morpheus,"We found a way to make it stop, Stan. Now are you interested? Or not?
"
15,8,Cartman,"Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
"
15,8,Clyde,"I just can't believe how yummy these are.
"
15,8,Cartman,"There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
"
15,8,Molly,"Thanks!
"
15,8,Cartman,"How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
"
15,8,Kyle,"About three minutes, fatass!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Nice!
"
15,8,Butters,"Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
"
15,8,Cartman,"It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
"
15,8,Kyle,"Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
"
15,8,Cartman,"I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! 
"
15,8,Morpheus,"Alright, is he ready to be sent in?
"
15,8,Bald Guy,"He's ready! Beta levels are normal.
"
15,8,Stan,"Who are you people?
"
15,8,Morpheus,"We are the Secret Society of Cynics.  Everything looks like shit to you, right? What if I were to tell you... that you're seeing the world the way it actually is?
"
15,8,Stan,"Huh?
"
15,8,Morpheus,"The world around us has all completely turned to shit. But aliens are putting out a brainwave that keeps most people seeing a false reality
"
15,8,Stan,"Aliens?
"
15,8,Morpheus,"Or, robots from the future, whatever. The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance.
"
15,8,Neo 2,"Yeah. Everything used to be awesome and cool, but now everything's gone to shit and nobody knows except us!
"
15,8,Neo,"Yeah!
"
15,8,Stan,"Because of aliens? 
"
15,8,Morpheus,"Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you! All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down. They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you! Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?
"
15,8,Stan,"Yeah I'm ready!
"
15,8,Morpheus,"Let's send him in!  Drink this. 
"
15,8,Stan,"Ahhhh!  Oh coool!
"
15,8,Adam Sandler,"Jill, you got a date with Al Pacino?
"
15,8,Jill,"I think Al Pacino wants to play Twister with your sister.
"
15,8,Stan,"Adam Sandler's funny.
"
15,8,Butters,"Hey Kyle, you have a visitor. 
"
15,8,Kyle,"Stan? 
"
15,8,Stan,"Kyle! 
"
15,8,Kyle,"Hey, Stan!
"
15,8,Stan,"Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
"
15,8,Kyle,"Stan, are you alright?
"
15,8,Stan,"Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
"
15,8,Kyle,"Really? Uh, Stan, that's great. 
"
15,8,Stan,"But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! 
"
15,8,Kyle,"Dude. Have you been drinking?
"
15,8,Stan,"You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
"
15,8,Kyle,"It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.
"
15,8,Stan,"...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? 
"
15,8,Kyle,"See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
"
15,8,Cartman,"Everything alright here, Kyle?
"
15,8,Kyle,"Yeah, it's fine.
"
15,8,Cartman,"We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
"
15,8,Kyle,"Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.
"
15,8,Stan,"Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
"
15,8,Kyle,"Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
"
15,8,Stan,"Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you. 
"
15,8,Big Harry,"Big Harry and Mike in the Morning and in case you didn't catch last night's episode of , we're breakin' it down.
"
15,8,Mike,"Oh Big Harry, when the  ran into the - 
"
15,8,Big Harry,"Nonono, no! How about when .
"
15,8,Morpheus,"He's back!  Did you see the illusionary world again?
"
15,8,Neo,"How does it feel to be back in the Matrix?
"
15,8,Stan,"I feel like total shit.
"
15,8,Bald Guy,"It's okay. That's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.
"
15,8,Morpheus,"Try and focus, Stan: we've found them! We know where the rock creatures are now.
"
15,8,Stan,"The rock creatures?
"
15,8,Morpheus,"Or aliens, or AI- things. Whatever, fuck you.
"
15,8,Stan,"Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
"
15,8,Neo,"He's gonna pop! 
"
15,8,Morpheus,"Come on kid, there's not a lot of time left.
"
15,8,Neo,"You're pushin' him too hard!
"
15,8,Stan,"Ugh God.
"
15,8,Morpheus,"Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion. We're sending you back in! 
"
15,8,Figure 1,"We all know why we are here. There's a rebellion in our midst and it must be SQUASHED OUT!  We have to put an end, to Cartman Burgers. 
"
15,8,Other Execs,"Yes, yes, but what do we do?
"
15,8,KFC Exec,"At KFC we've seen a 50% drop in sales.
"
15,8,Pizza Hut Exec,"It's worse at Pizza Hut. Cartman Burgers choked out the market.
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"What makes them so good? For whatever reason, these Cartman Burgers satisfy the taste cravings from all of our restaurants!
"
15,8,Taco Bell Exec,"There lies the secret.  It's the chemical compounds from all our flavors. Pizza Hut, Burger King, KFC, all somehow infused into one burger.
"
15,8,KFC Exec,"It's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredients of our food, breaking them down into some kind of... gas. And them somehow... infusing that gas into his hamburger. What kind of instrument could he be using to do this?
"
15,8,Pizza Hut Exec,"It would have to be some sort of super Dutch oven.
"
15,8,Burger King Exec,"But a Dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen. 
"
15,8,Stan,"Aughah. 
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"Hey! Wake up. Come on now, wake up!  Use the smelling salts! 
"
15,8,Stan,"...Enchirito?
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"You know the secret?
"
15,8,Stan,"What? You guys are aliens?
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"Stop playing with us! What's the secret behind Cartman Burger's amazing taste?!
"
15,8,Stan,"Dude, I don't know!
"
15,8,Taco Bell Exec,"He's lying!  You see this kid in the picture? This guy is his best friend.
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"Ah ha!
"
15,8,Stan,"I'm not friends with him.
"
15,8,Taco Bell Exec,"They've been through everything together. Inseparable.
"
15,8,Stan,"No, no, we don't hang out anymore.
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"Oho right, like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that?
"
15,8,Stan,"Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"Oh sure! Anyone would ditch out on their best friend 'cause they weren't feeling good! Now stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers is so delicious!
"
15,8,Stan,"I don't know!
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"Alright, I guess we're going to have to do this the hard way.
"
15,8,Kyle,"There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.
"
15,8,Cartman,"Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
"
15,8,Kyle,"Next please.  Oh, hey.
"
15,8,Stan,"Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
"
15,8,Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
15,8,Stan,"How do you guys make them so yummy?
"
15,8,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"You'd BETTER get him to tell you or you're getting shot in the back of the head!  You got that?!
"
15,8,Stan,"Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
"
15,8,Kyle,"Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
"
15,8,Stan,"No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
"
15,8,Kyle,"Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"Oh, right. Like a friend would walk out on somebody who was diagnosed with a serious illness!
"
15,8,Stan,"Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
"
15,8,Kyle,"You said ""fuck you"" to my face, Stan.
"
15,8,Stan,"Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"Oh yeah, like any friend would say something that severe and then try to take it back.
"
15,8,Kyle,"Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
"
15,8,McDonald's Exec,"Goddamnit this is getting us nowhere!  Everyone get back! Do you wanna play hardball?! That's fine!  All right, let's see this mighty machine once and for all! 
"
15,8,Morpheus,"You vampire sons of bitches! 
"
15,8,Neo,"Haha! 
"
15,8,Morpheus,"Alright, nice work Stan. Now comes the final step! You have to take out Duck President!
"
15,8,Stan,"Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
"
15,8,Mr. Mathers,"Uh oh, looks like the serum is wearing off!  Here, you'd better take some more! 
"
15,8,Stan,"No, I'm done with that! 
"
15,8,Morpheus,"But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was!
"
15,8,Stan,"I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.
"
15,8,Douglas,"Wow. 
"
15,8,Stan,"Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. 
"
15,8,Randy,"Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!
"
15,8,Stan,"What?
"
15,8,Randy,"We worked it out, pal. Surprise!
"
15,8,Stan,"No, dad, no. No, please!
"
15,8,Sharon,"We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know...
"
15,8,Stan,"No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
"
15,8,Sharon,"People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.
"
15,8,Kyle,"You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
"
15,8,Crowd,"Eeewww!
"
15,8,Big Harry,"I like that!
"
15,8,Mike,"Yeah.
"
15,8,Big Harry,"Big Harry and Mike in the Morning, talkin' about Two and a Half Men. I think Ashton Kutcher makes it the show to be seen, Mike.
"
15,8,Mike,"Yeah, but what about that movie Dolphin Tale? I am psyched for that!
"
15,8,Big Harry,"Dolphin Tale, Big Harry and Mike in the Morning.  Let's hear one from the band Slamjammer and their song- 
"
15,8,Kyle,"Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
"
15,8,Cartman,"The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! 
"
15,8,Stan,"...K, coming. 
"
15,9,Cartman,"Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready.  There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!
"
15,9,Liane,"Eric, you wanna say hi to Grandpa?
"
15,9,Cartman,"Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah!  All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!
"
15,9,The other four,"Yeehaw! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!
"
15,9,Stan,"Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
"
15,9,Butters,"Oh what, I'm not a good Meheecan?
"
15,9,Stan,"You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.
"
15,9,Kyle,"Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.
"
15,9,Cartman,"Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican! 
"
15,9,Kyle,"Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
"
15,9,Cartman,"He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
"
15,9,Kyle,"Better than being a fatass Texan!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
"
15,9,Kyle,"No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew!  Let's just see you try and-!
"
15,9,Stan,"Base! 
"
15,9,Cartman,"Clyde?!  The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
"
15,9,Clyde,"I was enthralled with the dialog exchange.
"
15,9,Cartman,"Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit!  If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!
"
15,9,Token,"Base!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Dude!!  How did he get past the fence, Craig?!
"
15,9,Craig,"I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.
"
15,9,Cartman,"Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! 
"
15,9,Jimmy,"Eh, b-base.
"
15,9,Cartman,"Oh God! 
"
15,9,Stan,"So, so then, so then the pope says, ""Maybe you should go check the toilet."" 
"
15,9,Craig,"Hey. Hey, I got one.  Why do girls wear makeup and perfume?
"
15,9,Token,"Why?
"
15,9,Craig,"'Cause they're ugly and they stink. 
"
15,9,Stan,"Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
"
15,9,Cartman,"I'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before!
"
15,9,Kyle,"So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
"
15,9,Cartman,"At least I have an asshole, Kyle! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: ""Go that way."" How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.
"
15,9,Butters,"Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border!  Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. 
"
15,9,Woman,"Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse.
"
15,9,Man,"It sure is. I-I can barely see. 
"
15,9,Woman,"Oh my God look out it's a Mexican! 
"
15,9,Man,"Oh my God, are you alright?
"
15,9,Butters,"Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting.
"
15,9,Man,"Poor thing must have snuck across the border and then lost track of his family.
"
15,9,Butters,"I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.
"
15,9,Woman,"Guest room. Guest room. Bed, bed. Pillow. You're going to be okay.  Do you understand?
"
15,9,Man,"Darling, I don't know if we can keep him.
"
15,9,Woman,"What are we supposed to do?! Call the police?! And have him shipped back to Mexico like some animal?!  Window. Window.
"
15,9,Man,"Yep, window.
"
15,9,Woman,"Bueno!  He'll have so much more opportunity here than he ever would in Mexico!  Window. Window.  Windex. Windex, Mantequilla. Paper towel.  Sí, sí Mantequilla 
"
15,9,Man,"Ah, be sure to get the edges.
"
15,9,Woman,"Oh darling, it's wonderful.
"
15,9,Cartman,"No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got...  Butters!  Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!
"
15,9,Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
15,9,Cartman,"Where is Butters?
"
15,9,Kyle,"He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
"
15,9,Stan,"Yeah, I think he was. Wait.
"
15,9,Craig,"Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.
"
15,9,Kyle,"Butters?
"
15,9,Stan,"Butters!
"
15,9,Kyle,"Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.
"
15,9,Cartman,"All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through!  You haven't won yet!  Game on!
"
15,9,Craig,"Game on!
"
15,9,Kyle,"Wugh, game on. 
"
15,9,Butters,"Work, Mexican, Work.  Work, Mexican, Work
"
15,9,Woman,"Mantequiila? Mantequilla, come to the living room. We have a surprise for you. 
"
15,9,Man,"Surprise! We've scraped some money together and got you something. 
"
15,9,Woman,"It's a present, Mantequilla. Un presente.
"
15,9,Butters,"Wow! A present just for me? 
"
15,9,Woman,"Oh he's such a happy little Mexican. 
"
15,9,Man,"How do you like that, Mantequilla? Your very own leaf blower! Hahah, I have no idea how it works, but I'm sure you do, huh. Say, how would you like to go in the back yard and play? 
"
15,9,Woman,"Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy.
"
15,9,Man,"Hup. Nono, Mantequilla! You're just blowing the leaves from one side to the other. Get them in one pile so you can use the garbage bags we loaned you.
"
15,9,Butters,"Ah, sí señor.
"
15,9,Woman,"Oh he's so adorable.
"
15,9,Singers,"Work, Mexican, work.
"
15,9,Butters,"All week long, bossman say
"
15,9,Both,"Work, Mexican, work.
"
15,9,Butters,"Sing your Song, earn your pay
"
15,9,Both,"Work, Mexican, work.Work, Meheecan
"
15,9,Singers,"Sweat
"
15,9,Butters,"Meheecan
"
15,9,Singers,"Toil
"
15,9,Butters,"Meheecan, it's your
"
15,9,Both,"lot in life.
"
15,9,Butters,"While people play in the sun all day
"
15,9,Both,"Work, Mexican, work.
"
15,9,Man,"Honey? Honey, what's wrong? 
"
15,9,Woman,"It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the dishes, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said ""I need to go home."" I tried telling him ""your home is here, Mantequilla! ¡Tu casa es aquí!"" But I don't think he feels it.
"
15,9,Man,"Well, maybe if we let him paint the garage, he'll feel more like family and then-
"
15,9,Woman,"No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!
"
15,9,Brian,"Come on, honey. 
"
15,9,Butters,"Hey, where are you going?
"
15,9,Woman,"No! Mantequilla bad! Go now!
"
15,9,Butters,"Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
"
15,9,Woman,"No es bueno, Mantequilla! ¡No me mi-mires! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor no mires! 
"
15,9,Butters,"So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 
"
15,9,Worker 1,"Mantequilla?
"
15,9,Worker 2,"Mantequilla?
"
15,9,Worker 1,"¡Yo he escuchado de este niño! ¡He visto anuncios de el por donde quiera! 
"
15,9,Worker 3,"Sí. Es famoso! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
"
15,9,Worker 1,"¿Un niño gringo que quiere ses mexicano? 
"
15,9,Worker 3,"Ay, tiempos han cambiado. 
"
15,9,Worker 1,"No... no. ¿Saben qué? Mantequilla tiene derecho. ¿Por qué venimos a este país? ¡Vale madre aquí, 'mano! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
"
15,9,Worker 1,"Debemos escuchar a este niño. ¡Mexico es mucho mejor que esto! 
"
15,9,Butters,"All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.
"
15,9,Worker 1,"Todos mis amigos están allí también.. 
"
15,9,Worker 2,"¡A la chingada con esto! ¡Vamonos! 
"
15,9,Worker 3,"Sí, ¡vamonos a la chingada!
"
15,9,Butters,"Viva la Meheeco!
"
15,9,Doctor,"Alright, let's get him into ER.
"
15,9,Elderly Man,"Careful w'my foot! 
"
15,9,Worker 2,"¡Oye Yimenez! ¡Nos vamos a regresar, hombre! 
"
15,9,Yimenez,"¿Qué? 
"
15,9,Worker 2,"¡Este lugar es una mierda! ¡Nos regresamos a Mexico!
"
15,9,Butters,"We're crossin' the border!
"
15,9,Yimenez,"¡Jose! ¡Martinez! Nos vamos para atras para Mexico! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Olé!
"
15,9,Border Officer 1,"Pretty quiet out there.
"
15,9,Border Officer 2,"Yeah, a bit too quiet if you ask me. Gimme those! 
"
15,9,Border Officer 1,"Just seems like Mexicans don't try to cross into the US as much as they used to, you know?
"
15,9,Border Officer 2,"Noo, they're out there, Charlie. Plottin' their next move. They'll do anything they can to get into the Land of Opportunity.  And as long as this country offers everyone a better life, there's gonna be people calmorin' to get it. It's the curse of success, Charlie.  A great and wealthy nation will always be plagued  by the needy tryin' to-what the hell? 
"
15,9,Charlie,"Uhh, sir? Aren't those Mexicans runnin' into Mexico?
"
15,9,Border Officer 2,"That don't make sense.
"
15,9,Charlie,"You're goin' the wrong way!
"
15,9,Anchorman,"You've heard of Mexican salsa, but Mexican pride? The phenomenon is called ""Orgullo de Mantequilla,"" where Mexicans are realizing it actually is starting to suck more here in the US. The borders are being flooded with Latin Americans trying to get back to their own countries. 
"
15,9,Randy,"Well, I think it's good.  If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy.  NOOOOOO!
"
15,9,Anchorman,"But just what has sparked the Mexican desire to live... in Mexico? Joining us now is economist Mark Geiger, and Mark, we've heard of Mexican ice cream, but Mexican patriotism?
"
15,9,Mr. Geiger,"Yes, it's a very odd phenomenon, Chris. Ih it just- 
"
15,9,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell is this?! 
"
15,9,Cartman,"You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
"
15,9,Kyle,"""Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol""?! ""Permission to shoot on sight""?!
"
15,9,Cartman,"You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
"
15,9,Kyle,"Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?
"
15,9,Chris,"Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.
"
15,9,Cartman,"Oh dude. Sweet.
"
15,9,Crowd,"¡Vamos Mantequilla!  ¡Vamos Mantequilla!  ¡Vamos Mantequilla! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Oh uh, I'm sorry,  I don't really-
"
15,9,Crowd,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  ¡Oy!  ¡Oy!  ¡Orgullo!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. 
"
15,9,Butters,"Wow.
"
15,9,Border Officer 2,"Welcome to the US Border Patrol. You volunteers are the key to keepin' this country safe and prosperous.  Every day, more and more Mexicans are tryin' to get past this fence and go back to their homes in Mexico. As border patrol officers our duty is to stop Mexicans from crossin' the border. We don't need to worry about the semantics of which direction they're going, we're just supposed to stop them!  Marcus?
"
15,9,Marcus,"The standard-issue border patrol weapon is the P-29 stun baton. It carries a 4000 watt charge and is your best option for enforcin' border patrol law.
"
15,9,Cartman,"This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
"
15,9,Marcus,"The baton is non-lethal, but powerful e-
"
15,9,Border Officer 3,"Hey! We got some! Mexicans at 2 o'clock! 
"
15,9,Border Officer 2,"Let's get ready, recruits! Must be a couple dozen of them!  This is the US Border Patrol! Stop where you are! Turn around and get back to work!
"
15,9,Marcus,"There's too many of 'em! We're gonna need backup! 
"
15,9,Border Officer 2,"You're pretty good at stoppin' Mexicans, son. What's your name?
"
15,9,Cartman,"Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
"
15,9,Narrator,"Dedicated. Patriotic. Tireless. These are the men and women of the US Border Patrol. They work around the clock protecting American prosperity. They are the front line in making sure Mexicans stay here and work. The border patrol is uncompromising, diligent, and cool. They will defend, arrest, and most importantly, let the Mexicans know that they are way better off here in the United States.
"
15,9,President Calderón,"¡Hoy celebramos el primer día de Mantequilla, honrando el espiritu de México! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.
"
15,9,President Calderón,"Mantequilla, tu tienes que hacer una decisión. Los Estados Unidos están de baja, y claro, México pronto será el mejor lugar. Pero como Mexicanos, nosotros sabemos que nada es más importante que la famlia, y amistades. Estás invitado a vivir con nosotros, Mantequilla, pero tienes que seguir tu corazón. ¿Quieres quedarte aquí con nosotros, o quieres estar con tus amigos? 
"
15,9,Butters,"...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
"
15,9,Cartman,"No Mexicans detected.  Huh, nothing.
"
15,9,Border Officer 4,"Let's face it: they've just about all gotten back across. No matter how hard we tried, the Mexicans all got across the border.
"
15,9,Border Officer 2,"When we asked Obama to stop illegal immigrants, we didn't mean to make the US so shitty they wouldn't wanna come anymore.
"
15,9,Marcus,"Hey! Hey wait a minute!  It's a Mexican!  I think he wants to come back in! 
"
15,9,Border Officer 2,"Oh my God it is!  Hey! Hey! Come on in!  Come on! Come on! Come on, it's okay!  What the fuck are you doing?! Get that gate open! 
"
15,9,Border Officer 5,"Come on, buddy!
"
15,9,Other Officers,"Come on now, come on! You've got it. 
"
15,9,Cartman,"Wait a minute, isn't that...
"
15,9,Butters,"Game on!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Oh no you don't! 
"
15,9,Butters,"AAAH!
"
15,9,Border Officer 2,"What the fuck are you doin'?!
"
15,9,Cartman,"That asshole is not getting across my border! 
"
15,9,Butters,"AAAAH!  I'll get over! 
"
15,9,Cartman,"No you won't Butters!
"
15,9,Butters,"Giddy up! 
"
15,9,Commentator,"Un otro shoto de Mantequilla. Y Manteque-ah. ¡Oh! ¡Una arma! Una arma del El Niño Gordo! 
"
15,9,Mexicans,"Ohhh!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Ey!
"
15,9,Commentator,"Mantequilla ayudar ¡1a Border Patrol! 
"
15,9,Cartman,"¡Respeto mi autóridad! 
"
15,9,Commentator,"Border Patrol pegaron ¡El Zero Gordo! 
"
15,9,Cartman,"Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee!
"
15,9,Cartman,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Base! 
"
15,9,Mexicans,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
15,9,Commentator,"El mirito, vinto! 
"
15,9,Butters,"So then, so then the fireman says ""That won't even fit in my scrotum!""  Yeah!
"
15,9,Kyle,"Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!
"
15,9,Cartman,"I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
"
15,9,Butters,"Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
"
15,9,Stan,"Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.
"
15,9,Kyle,"Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. 
"
15,9,Mexicans,"¡Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...  ¡Oy! ¡Oy!  ¡Orgullo!  ¡Maaantequilla! 
"
15,9,Cartman,"A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
"
15,10,Cartman,"YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You're never gonna guess what!  Seriously you guys, guess what??
"
15,10,Stan,"What?
"
15,10,Cartman,"You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
"
15,10,Kyle,"The blond kid?
"
15,10,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!
"
15,10,Stan,"What about him?
"
15,10,Cartman,"He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! 
"
15,10,Kyle,"How do you know?!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
"
15,10,Butters,"Eavesdropper?
"
15,10,Kyle,"What's that?
"
15,10,Cartman,"Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper?   It's a Web site about all the students in the school! 
"
15,10,Clyde,"Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! 
"
15,10,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom.  Just listen, listen listen.
"
15,10,Nurse Bronski,"Hello Mrs. Melman, this is the school nurse. I'm afraid your son has had a little accident. 
"
15,10,Mrs. Melman,"Oh no, what is it? Is he okay?
"
15,10,Stan,"Turn it up. 
"
15,10,Nurse Bronski,"No no, it's not serious, but he went number two during class.  I'm afraid he's gonna need a new pair of pants and underwear, and a clean pair of socks.
"
15,10,Craig,"Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper?
"
15,10,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! 
"
15,10,Kyle,"Dude, that's so wrong!
"
15,10,Butters,"Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, ""Poopypants Pete"", but th- but then I also thought of ""Mushpants Melman.""
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Attention South Park Students: will the following students report to the Principal's office immediately? Eric Cartman? Thank you.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, what now?! 
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! 
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?
"
15,10,Cartman,"Yeah, he killed himself.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Yes, and the reason he killed himself, Eric, was that the ridicule and the torment from other students,  spearheaded by you, cause him-!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Hey! Whoooa.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Spearheaded by you, m'kay, made him feel there was no other way out.
"
15,10,Cartman,"'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
"
15,10,Mr. Adler,"Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete.
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"Please just let it go.
"
15,10,Cartman,"You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"We are hoping that if you don't fan the flames, Eric, the other students might forget might forget about it!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"If Pete Melman does not kill himself,  we will make it very worth your while.
"
15,10,Cartman,"You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?
"
15,10,Stan,"No way.
"
15,10,Kyle,"What's up?
"
15,10,Stan,"The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
"
15,10,Kyle,"Dude, that's fucked up.
"
15,10,Stan,"Come on dude, it's pretty funny.
"
15,10,Kyle,"It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
"
15,10,Stan,"Yeah dude, that's pretty funny.
"
15,10,Butters,"It's megasuperhilarious! 
"
15,10,Cartman,"Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?
"
15,10,Jenny,"What do you want?!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
"
15,10,Jenny,"Yeah, it's gross! 
"
15,10,Cartman,"So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. 
"
15,10,Jenny,"So what?
"
15,10,Cartman,"I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of...  liked you.
"
15,10,Jenny,"I don't like you!
"
15,10,Cartman,"I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
"
15,10,Jenny,"Hey. Wait.  Look, I'm sorry. That was mean. I'd love to try one of your mom's cupcakes.
"
15,10,Mr. Garrison,"And now number 17 many of you got wrong as well. The correct answer was D, whales are mammals. 
"
15,10,Jenny,"Oh! Gahhh. Ohf.
"
15,10,Mr. Garrison,"They're not fish like some of you retards chose.
"
15,10,Cartman,"You okay, Jenny?
"
15,10,Jenny,"Yeah, I'm fine, I just- Awwgh!  M-Mr. Garrison? Can I please  be excused?
"
15,10,Cartman,"Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. 
"
15,10,Mr. Garrison,"What's the matter?
"
15,10,Jenny,"Gah I just need to go to the restroom!
"
15,10,Mr. Garrison,"Well okay.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.
"
15,10,Jenny,"Please! I've gotta go now!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
"
15,10,Jenny,"No, Mr. Garrison, I've gotta- go- AAAH! 
"
15,10,Class,"Eeeeww! 
"
15,10,Cartman,"Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
"
15,10,Kids,"Ew!
"
15,10,Butters,"Sick!
"
15,10,Cartman,"WAY worse!
"
15,10,Timmy,"Run. 
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Alright, kewl.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"No, not cool! M'kay, she's on suicide watch, Eric! She's given up on life!
"
15,10,Cartman,"You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! 
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
"
15,10,The three adults,"Yes!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Our students did average, maybe just below average.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"That's insane!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? 
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, hi Jan, it's Counselor Mackey. Uh... how long would it take to organize a Pizza Friday for the students? Yeah, yeah no they uh, they actually did really well on the state exam. Yeah, mkay.
"
15,10,Stan,"Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her ""soft-serve Simon.""
"
15,10,Kyle,"That's not funny.
"
15,10,Craig,"Hey, here's a post about Token: ""Token Black's Private Gym Photos"" 
"
15,10,Kyle,"I'm not looking at that!
"
15,10,Stan,"Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!
"
15,10,Kyle,"It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
"
15,10,Stan,"I wouldn't care.
"
15,10,Craig,"Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.
"
15,10,Stan,"What?
"
15,10,Craig,"""In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'.""
"
15,10,Stan,"Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!
"
15,10,Kenny,"(What?)
"
15,10,Stan,"How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
"
15,10,Kenny,"(I don't know.)
"
15,10,Stan,"Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
"
15,10,Kenny,"(No!)
"
15,10,Stan,"That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.
"
15,10,Wendy,"You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!
"
15,10,Kenny,"(Oh fuck I'm gettin' out of here!) 
"
15,10,Stan,"No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
"
15,10,Wendy,"Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?! 
"
15,10,Stan,"Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
"
15,10,Wendy,"So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?! 
"
15,10,Stan,"This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.
"
15,10,Kyle,"So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
"
15,10,Stan,"Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
"
15,10,Wendy,"Specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack. 
"
15,10,Stan,"Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!
"
15,10,Craig,"It's not somebody in this room.
"
15,10,Stan,"What? How do you know?
"
15,10,Craig,"Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: ""Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker.""  Yeah. Hey wait, that's me.
"
15,10,Kyle,"Where is it coming from?
"
15,10,Craig,"Huh?
"
15,10,Kyle,"If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
"
15,10,Stan,"We only have music class on Thursday.
"
15,10,Wendy,"Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.
"
15,10,Kyle,"Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
"
15,10,Stan,"Oh I'm ready!
"
15,10,Kyle,"One.  Two. Three! 
"
15,10,Craig,"It's a rat! 
"
15,10,Kyle,"Get it! 
"
15,10,Stan,"Don't let him get away!
"
15,10,Token,"He's gone!
"
15,10,Stan,"What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
"
15,10,Kyle,"Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.
"
15,10,Frog King,"Lemmiwinks! I come with news of great gravity. Another rodent is out there, spreading terrible rumors and hacking e-mails.  Yes. And I'm afraid the news is worse. The creature doing this, Lemmiwinks, is your brother, Wikileaks!
"
15,10,Singer,"''Wikileaks, the bum hacker with a heart of doom.Everyone knows the gerbil king, but no one ever speaksOf Lemminwinks's brother, the evil Likiweaks...
"
15,10,Frog King,"Once again Wikileaks is trying to wreak havoc on our world. Only you can stop him, Lemmiweaks.
"
15,10,Singer,"Lemmiwinks, King of Gerbils, stop your brother of doom!
"
15,10,Girl 1,"It's just so embarrassing. What if the other girls find out my mother is in rehab?
"
15,10,Girl 2,"It's okay Emily. Can I tell you a secret? My mom has a drinking problem too. 
"
15,10,Emily,"Really? You too?
"
15,10,Girl 2,"That's just between us, okay?
"
15,10,Emily,"Of course, Tammy. I'm really glad I shared this with you. 
"
15,10,Stan,"Stop that rat! 
"
15,10,Stan,"Knock it off! 
"
15,10,Boy 1,"I just want you to know that I have a hure crush on you and-  HEY! 
"
15,10,Butters,"NO Wikileaks! Bad!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Eh, Is this one good?
"
15,10,Cartman,"Yeah, I think they're all ready.
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?
"
15,10,Cartman,"It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Alright Eric, well, well get back to class. We don't want anyone seeing you in here with us.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Alright, fine. Bring her in, Adler. 
"
15,10,Cartman,"Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come! 
"
15,10,Selena Gomez,"Hi Eric. I understand you really wanted to meet me. Wanna get a picture together?
"
15,10,Cartman,"No thanks. Okay, proceed.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"I/m sorry about this, Ms. Gomez.  Alright, get her the fuck out of here. 
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?
"
15,10,Cartman,"That. Was. Amazing.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Alright now, get back to class! Adler, get rid of those laxative bottles! Trash all the Arby's horsey sauce packages too! There cannot be one piece of evidence of what we did here!  What the?  Oh shit!  Stop that rat!
"
15,10,Frog King,"Alright Lemmiwinks, we should probably get going now... The time is nigh, Lemmiwinks. Let us chase your destiny.  Ah! Sparrow Prince! What news do you bring?
"
15,10,Sparrow Prince,"Wikileaks grows stronger with each passing moment.  The birds are tweeting that he is about to release his biggest story yet.
"
15,10,Frog King,"Then the moment is truly here! Come Lemmiwinks! Let us make haste! Le-le-Lemmiwinks? His heart is so heavy. I weep for him.
"
15,10,Sparrow Prince,"Indeed. Could you do it, Frog Prince? Could you kill your own brother?
"
15,10,Frog King,"I thank God I don't have to make that decision.  We might need to bring in some outside help.
"
15,10,Stan,"You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
"
15,10,Butters,"Biggest story about who?
"
15,10,Craig,"There's no telling. It could be about any of us. 
"
15,10,Catatafish,"Well met, children of Adam. I, am Catatafish.
"
15,10,Singers,"Catatafish of the Salmon School.
"
15,10,Kyle,"What?
"
15,10,Catatafish,"I come asking for your help. There is only one thing that can stop Wikileaks. But right now Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner.
"
15,10,Stan,"Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?
"
15,10,Kyle,"What is that thing?
"
15,10,Catatafish,"I am Catatafish. I am a great wizard and, I am a friend. And I'm a ghost, besides of course being a fish.
"
15,10,Singers,"Catatafish's tale will soon be told.
"
15,10,Stan,"Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
"
15,10,Catatafish,"He does it purely for reasons of evil. And his treachery is not limited to humans. Wikileaks posted exaggerated things about me, too. He posted on his Web site that I had sex with an underage fish, and that I made her perform bass to mouth. If you accept this quest you will help the Gerbil King defeat Wikileaks once and for all! But the choice is yours. I'm not here to make you do anything. Like that underage salmon. I didn't make her do anything. If she wants to do bass to mouth, how is it my fault?
"
15,10,Singers,"Catatafish made a salmon suck asshole.
"
15,10,Catatafish,"No! No, see, that's wrong! It's being exaggerated again!
"
15,10,Kyle,"Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!
"
15,10,Catatafish,"Careful child! I assure you, Wikileaks is anything but stupid, except when he said I made that teenage fish perform ass to trout. That was stupid and untrue. Did I say ass to trout? I meant to say bass to mouth, though I guess it's basically the same thing, not that I did it.
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"Alright, are we sure we're alone?
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"We're alone, now what the hell are we gonna do?
"
15,10,Mr. Adler,"What can we do? We're all gonna get fired!
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh right! ""The School Faculty Tries To Poison All Their Students."" That's not gonna be on Wikileaks!
"
15,10,Mr. Adler,"Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"All we were tryin' to do was keep another one of our students from killing themselves! We're not bad!
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"No, no, we're not bad.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"We're not bad. I mean, maybe what we needed was just to think outside the box here. I mean, if there's anything we've learned is that the only thing that makes a juicy story go away is a juicier story.
"
15,10,Principal Victoria,"What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?
"
15,10,Mr. Adler,"Our students committing suicide?
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Hey that's right. Corey Duran killed himself last year and we're STILL dealing with the fallout. Maybe there is a way out of this. But we're gonna have to throw Eric Cartman under the bus.
"
15,10,Mr. Adler,"How do we do that?
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"We get a bus... and then we... throw Eric Cartman under it.
"
15,10,Mother,"Yes?
"
15,10,Stan,"Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?
"
15,10,Mother,"Yes, Vernon's around somewhere.
"
15,10,Stan,"Come on, guys! 
"
15,10,Catatafish,"Excuse me.
"
15,10,Butters,"There he is!  It's Lemmiwinks! 
"
15,10,Stan,"Quick, we need something to carry him in!
"
15,10,Kyle,"Here's a shoebox! 
"
15,10,Vernon,"Hey! What are you doing with my gerbil?!
"
15,10,Stan,"We just need to borrow him, kid. 
"
15,10,Vernon,"MOOOM! SOME KIDS ARE STEALING MY GERBIL!
"
15,10,Stan,"Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!
"
15,10,Vernon,"MOOOM! 
"
15,10,Frog King,"There's no time, children! You must take Lemmiwinks now!
"
15,10,Kyle,"Grab him! 
"
15,10,Vernon,"MOOOM! 
"
15,10,Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
"
15,10,Frog King,"Quickly! We must get to the school! 
"
15,10,Stan,"Whoa whoa wait, wait! 
"
15,10,Singers,"Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!
"
15,10,Stan,"Can't this thing go any faster?
"
15,10,Butters,"Hang on, Lemmiwinks!
"
15,10,Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks! Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!
"
15,10,Stan,"Craig, are we still clear?
"
15,10,Craig,"Nothing broke on the Web site yet.
"
15,10,Frog King,"Faster driver! The final battle is about to begin! 
"
15,10,Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
"
15,10,Kyle,"What the hell happened?!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh! Oh God! Oh God he killed himself! Eric Cartman killed himself! Did you see that? Oh why would he do it?  Oh wait uh here, here's a suicide note. Mkay.  Dear Guys, I just cannot go on mkay. I'm tired of being FAT, mkay, and I have to end it all. Mkay. -Eric Cartman.
"
15,10,Stan,"Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Well why the hell didn't you say so! Come on, let's go!
"
15,10,Sparrow Prince,"Go by car!
"
15,10,Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
"
15,10,Frog King,"Quickly, while Lemmiwinks still has it in him!
"
15,10,Singers,"Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!
"
15,10,Stan,"Stop right there, you little rat!
"
15,10,Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks! Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
"
15,10,Frog King,"Wikileaks, you have chosen a path of evil and now you shall pay. Sparrow Prince, Catatafish! 
"
15,10,Frog King,"Oh dude, he is fucking him up!
"
15,10,Butters,"Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him! 
"
15,10,Frog King,"He did it!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, let's just delete all this tabloid garbage, mkay.
"
15,10,Stan,"Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
15,10,Kyle,"Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Boy, I say.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh Eric! Uh, Eric, I know we kinda threw you under the bus, mkay, but I hope you understand the faculty didn't really have a choice.
"
15,10,Cartman,"It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Well I think you're being very mature about this, Eric. It was an overly generous move to give all the faculty those cupcakes. I wanna thank you. Mkay.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Oh, you're most certainly welcome.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Well students, why don't we uh-  Oooh. Oh, gee, uh...
"
15,10,Cartman,"Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, I j-I just uh I'll be right back. Oh!  Aaaah! Oh it's bad!  Excuse me kids, I need to run, I gotta WUUGH!  OW!
"
15,10,Cartman,"I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, can somebody get me some paper towels?? Or maybe a  Ooowww, okay!  Ooohhh, it's bad!
"
15,10,Frog King,"Congratulations, Lemmiwinks.
"
15,10,Sparrow Prince,"Thanks to you, private lives will stay private.
"
15,10,Catatafish,"Yes, we are all free once again to make teenagers do bass to mouth.
"
15,10,Frog King,"Just one question Lemmiwinks: How does it feel to have killed your own brother?  Le-Lemmiwinks?  He's devastated.
"
15,10,Sparrow Prince,"Yup, he's devastated.
"
15,11,Randy,"I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?
"
15,11,Nelson,"I didn't see the game.
"
15,11,Randy,"You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
"
15,11,Nelson,"Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
"
15,11,Randy,"A musical?  Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! 
"
15,11,Worker 1,"Good for you, Nelson. Did you get a blowjob afterwards?
"
15,11,Nelson,"Sure did.
"
15,11,Worker 2,"Niice. 
"
15,11,Randy,"What?
"
15,11,Worker 1,"I took my girl to see that show last week. Got the best hummer of my entire life afterwards.
"
15,11,Nelson,"Forty-five minutes non-stop.
"
15,11,Randy,"Nuh uh.
"
15,11,Worker 2,"It's true. I'm taking my wife on Saturday bro.
"
15,11,Randy,"Noh uh.
"
15,11,Nelson,"I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome.
"
15,11,Randy,"Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
"
15,11,Nelson,"Wicked.
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh. Wicked.
"
15,11,Singers,"...Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe, she was just wicked people
Head to toe...
She wasn't good, to know what goodness is...
"
15,11,Randy,"Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?
"
15,11,Sharon,"Nono, I'm good, thanks.
"
15,11,Randy,"Okay, I'll be right back.  'Scuse me, sorry. 
"
15,11,Randy,"Can I get a scotch and soda? 
"
15,11,Man 1,"Enjoying the show?
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.
"
15,11,Man 1,"No?
"
15,11,Randy,"To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.
"
15,11,Man 1,"Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is ""blowjob.""
"
15,11,Randy,"Subliminal messages?
"
15,11,Man 1,"It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it ""subtext."" Just listen really, really closely.
"
15,11,The Wizard,"While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!
"
15,11,Singers,"Take me away to that special place (that blowjob place)
Where people like us can all live free (Free to give blowjobs)
Take me away and let's live together
That's the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me
"
15,11,Witches,"Now let's try ... defying ................... gravity ...
"
15,11,Male,"....... Look at them ... becoming friends ... here in Oz, you love blowjobs.
"
15,11,Witches,"And new loves cry ... defying ................... gravity ...
"
15,11,Male,"....... Suddenly ... Don't you love free love blowjobs?
"
15,11,Sharon,"Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head.  Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? 
"
15,11,Randy,"Whoa, no way!
"
15,11,Stan,"Come on, Larry!  Dude, why does this happen every time?
"
15,11,Shelly,"Do something, you stupid vegan!
"
15,11,Cartman,"Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
"
15,11,Randy,"You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!
"
15,11,Man 2,"How long was it?
"
15,11,Randy,"She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.
"
15,11,Worker 2,"Nice, bro!
"
15,11,Randy,"Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it.
"
15,11,Stephen,"What was the show about?
"
15,11,Randy,"Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.
"
15,11,Stan,"Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! 
"
15,11,Shelly,"Go! Go! 
"
15,11,Randy,"Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
"
15,11,Worker 2,"Wicked isn't even the best, bro. You've gotta check out Jersey Boys! It makes women hummer crazy!
"
15,11,Randy,"Really??
"
15,11,Worker 1,"Nonono, have you see South Pacific? That's a jaw-breaker.
"
15,11,Randy,"Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
"
15,11,Sharon,"What?? Randy, are you serious??
"
15,11,Randy,"I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
"
15,11,Sharon,"Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?
"
15,11,Stan,"Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
"
15,11,Shelly,"Not the vegans!
"
15,11,Stan,"No. Dad. Please don't do this!
"
15,11,Mr. Feegan,"It takes a lot of guts to be a vegan in today's world! You get labeled ""soft"" or ""silly.""  But the truth is there isn't a need to eat animal products. Would you ever believe that hot dog was vegan?
"
15,11,Shelly,"Yes.
"
15,11,Mr. Feegan,"Cancer, heart disease, drowning, all preventable with a vegan diet and a life jacket. And if people wanna say us vegans are silly, well they can just laugh all they want, 'cause being vegan is more important than being popular!
"
15,11,Shelly,"Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. 
"
15,11,Mr. Feegan,"He does decide for himself! Larry's been a vegan since he was born! 
"
15,11,Shelly,"Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school. 
"
15,11,Mr. Feegan,"You know that when you think you have the flu, you're actually experiencing the gastrointestinal effects of contaminated meats or eggs? Researchers have found that in meat-eating households there is more fecal bacteria in the kitchen sinks than in the toilets.
"
15,11,Stan,"Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?
"
15,11,Country Singer,"Man time! I need some Man Time!
I got the horses fed and the truck locked up, been workin' my fingers to the bone.
Now I need a little bit of man time, gonna see me a Broadway show!
"
15,11,Female Sailor,"Anything goes
"
15,11,Male Sailor 1,"Blowjob!
"
15,11,Female Sailor,"Anything goes
"
15,11,Male Sailor 2,"Blowjob!
"
15,11,Singers,"Man time!
"
15,11,Females,"Hear things more clearly
"
15,11,Males,"Day blowjob day!
"
15,11,Country Singer,"I'm about to get drunk and loud, gonna have me a rowdy good time.
All I need is my girl and my truck and some Rodgers and Hammerstein!
"
15,11,Christine,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
"
15,11,The Phantom,"''Sing, my angel of blowjob music!
"
15,11,Female,"But the tigers come at night!
"
15,11,Male,"On you bed
"
15,11,Singers,"Man time!
"
15,11,Males,"...........job, blowjob.
"
15,11,Females,"It's cold up here, I'm locked up here
"
15,11,Singers,"Man time!
"
15,11,Singers,"Man time!
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!
"
15,11,Man 2,"Sounds like a dream, bro.
"
15,11,Randy,"It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is ""Wicked"" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.
"
15,11,Worker 1,"And Wicked moves to Seattle in a couple of weeks.
"
15,11,Nelson,"It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.
"
15,11,Stephen,"Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.
"
15,11,Randy,"Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
"
15,11,Bob,"Huh?
"
15,11,Randy,"Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.
"
15,11,Lady 1,"O what a glorious Sunday. I know what I'd like to do with my time.
''
Would you like a blowjob?
"
15,11,Man 3,"Yes I would like a blowjob 
"
15,11,Both,"Nothing beats a blowjob on football Sunday.
"
15,11,Lady 1,"Excuse me, I'm the queen of blowjobs.
"
15,11,Man 4,"Really? I would love a blowjob.
"
15,11,All,"A woman should give blowjobs on football Sunday
"
15,11,Lady 1,"I want to be covered in semen on a bed in the Hotel Jerome
A woman is prettiest covered in semen.
"
15,11,All,"Give you husband a blowjob when you get home.
"
15,11,Man 4,"And what about you, my fair lady? Could I trouble you for a quick Lewinsky?
"
15,11,Lady 2,"Oh I don't know, kind sir. Blowjobs seem a little degrading to me.
"
15,11,Man 4,"Come now, a blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart.
"
15,11,Men,"Now get on your knees and put that heart to work!
"
15,11,All,"Blowjobs, give up your blowjobs.
"
15,11,Men,"You're guilty at blowjobs, you love giving blowjobs
"
15,11,Women,"... Blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs
"
15,11,Singers,"So what could be better on a football Sunday? What could be better on a football Sunday?
"
15,11,Shelly,"What do you want, Larry? 
"
15,11,Larry,"Today, I went to 7-11 and I ate a Slim Jim. It was the greatest thing I ever tasted. Nobody ever stood up for me before. 
"
15,11,Lady 1,"Oh Reginald! How about a hummer at halftime? A Super Bowl suckle from me?
"
15,11,Reginald,"A Supwerbowl hummer at halftime from my lovely blowjob queen!
"
15,11,Both,"Two people in love it's amazing. Tim Tebow please don't let us down. How about a hummer at halftime-?
"
15,11,Representative,"Mr. Randy Marsh?
"
15,11,Randy,"And hold!  Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there.  Uhh, this better be important.
"
15,11,Representative,"It is. I represent some of the biggest names in all of Broadway. They wish to speak with you.
"
15,11,Randy,"Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it!
"
15,11,Representative,"Mr. Marsh, this is Andrew Lloyd Webber 
"
15,11,Webber,"Helleow.
"
15,11,Representative,"Stephen Schwartz
"
15,11,Schwartz,"Hey bro.
"
15,11,Representative,"Mr. Elton John.  and Stephen Sondheim.
"
15,11,Sondheim,"Sup bro?
"
15,11,Randy,"Not much, sup with you guys?
"
15,11,Sondheim,"No. I mean, ""sup, bro!""
"
15,11,Webber,"Sit down, Mr. Marsh, we need to have a talk. 
"
15,11,Schwartz,"We got wind of your musical. Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
"
15,11,Randy,"Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
"
15,11,Elton John,"You're making it too obvious! Women are gonna figure out what we're doin'!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"Musicals are about subtext!
"
15,11,Randy,"My musical has lots of subtext.
"
15,11,Sondheim,"""A blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart. Now get on your knees and put that heart to work.""
"
15,11,Randy,"And then she does. It's a metaphor.
"
15,11,Schwartz,"Bro! What's metaphorical about a musical called ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen""?!
"
15,11,Webber,"Tricking bitches into hour-long blowjobs is an art form. You have to leave it to the professionals!
"
15,11,Randy,"Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"You're gonna ruin everything, you idiot!
"
15,11,Randy,"Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!  And now I need to get back to rehearsals.  Oh. And if ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. 
"
15,11,Shelly,"What do you want, Larry? 
"
15,11,Larry,"You make me come out of my shell, Shelly.
You give me strength where there was only fear
I ate at a Burger King today, Shelly
And stood up to a boy who called me ""queer""
When you pushed me off the diving board I
...fell.
And you make the world a nicer place, Shelly
So I can come out of my... shell.
"
15,11,Shelly,"Hey!  Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox? 
"
15,11,Actors,"Blow--- job--- Queen!
Don't stop giving that blowjob. Even when you're tired, don't stop! Don't stop!
Shaaaaroooon!
"
15,11,Worker 2,"Randy! Randy, brah!
"
15,11,Randy,"Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?
"
15,11,Worker 2,"Stephen Sondheim is really pissed off, Randy. He says he wants to challenge you to a bro down.
"
15,11,Randy,"Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! 
"
15,11,Worker 2,"Randy, no! Stephen Sondheim is the greatest Broadway composer alive today! Perhaps the greatest of all time! You do NOT want to bro down with him.
"
15,11,Randy,"Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
"
15,11,Man 2,"Don't bro down against Sondheim, Randy! It's suicide!
"
15,11,Randy,"I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down! 
"
15,11,Larry,"Oh no, you built another settlement?
"
15,11,Shelly,"And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.
"
15,11,Larry,"Oh wow!
"
15,11,Mrs. Feegan,"They're having such a great time together. I really wanna thank you, Sharon.
"
15,11,Sharon,"No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too.
"
15,11,Mrs. Feegan,"I have to admit it makes me a little nervous having Larry up there without a life preserver on, but I guess we have to take changes sometimes.
"
15,11,Sharon,"That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical.
"
15,11,Mrs. Feegan,"That's right, I, I hear his musical is getting a lot of attention, that it really has a chance of making it.
"
15,11,Sharon,"Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.
"
15,11,Randy,"Whassup brah?!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"What brah?!
"
15,11,Randy,"Sup brah?!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"Take a swing, brah!
"
15,11,Randy,"Right here, brah! 
"
15,11,Webber,"Let's go, Sondheim! Wipe the street with his punk ass!
"
15,11,Randy,"What makes you the brauthority brah?!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"West Side Story, brah!
"
15,11,Randy,"What brah?!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"Sweeney Todd, brah!
"
15,11,Randy,"What brah?! What brah?!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"Merrily We Rode Along, bro! Why you gotta disrespect, bro?!
"
15,11,Randy,"I do respect you, bro!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"Show some respect, bro!
"
15,11,Randy,"I do respect you, bro!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"Then stop disrespectin', bro!
"
15,11,Randy,"I respect you, bro!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"Okay, I respect you too!
"
15,11,Randy,"Okay! 
"
15,11,Schwartz,"The bro down is over! Let's bro out!
"
15,11,Spectator,"Bro out!
"
15,11,Spectator 2,"Party people!
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!
"
15,11,Schwartz,"That's what bros fuckin' do!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"You're alright, Marsh. If it's cool with you, bro, Elton and Andrew and all of us wanna help you with your musical.
"
15,11,Randy,"Hey, really??
"
15,11,Elton John,"Yeh. We can help youse out a li'l bit with the subtext. 
"
15,11,Webber,"How about instead of ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"" we call it... ""The Woman In White""
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh, that is beautiful!
"
15,11,Bros,"Yeeeeeeeah!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"And a cheer to Randy Marsh. Welcome... to Bro'dway.
"
15,11,Randy,"Bro'dwaaay!
"
15,11,Sondheim,"Wooooooooooo!
"
15,11,Webber,"Woohoo!
"
15,11,Randy,"Ooof. 
"
15,11,Sharon,"Hey hun.
"
15,11,Randy,"Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys.
"
15,11,Sharon,"Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?
"
15,11,Randy,"Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.
"
15,11,Sharon,"Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.
"
15,11,Randy,"Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?
"
15,11,Sharon,"Of course not, go ahead, hun.
"
15,11,Randy,"Alright babe.
"
15,11,Sharon,"I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly.
"
15,11,Randy,"Okay. What's Shelly doing?
"
15,11,Sharon,"I gave her those tickets to ""Wicked.""  She's seeing it with her little boyfriend.
"
15,11,Randy,"She's WHAT?!
"
15,11,Sharon,"Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see ""Wicked"" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.
"
15,11,Randy,"OH!  Shelly! Hold on! 
"
15,11,Sharon,"Randy, slow down! Jesus Christ!
"
15,11,Randy,"AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see ""Wicked""?!
"
15,11,Sharon,"Why does it matter?!
"
15,11,Randy,"She's too young for that stuff!
"
15,11,Sharon,"Too young?!
"
15,11,Randy,"This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
"
15,11,Sharon,"That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!
"
15,11,Randy,"I can't!
"
15,11,Sharon,"WHY?!
"
15,11,Randy,"Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.
"
15,11,Sharon,"That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!
"
15,11,Randy,"D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw ""Wicked""?
"
15,11,Sharon,"Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but-
"
15,11,Randy,"And after ""Lion King"" in New York? ""Godspell""? ""Mamma Mia""?
"
15,11,Sharon,"Oh my gosh.
"
15,11,Randy,"Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
"
15,11,Sharon,"Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.
"
15,11,Randy,"No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.
"
15,11,Sharon,"It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw ""Grease"" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we-  Oh my God!
"
15,11,Randy,"AAAA!
"
15,11,Sharon,"AAAA!
"
15,11,Randy,"Shelly! 
"
15,11,Singers,"No one cares about wicked people.
Now she's gone but we don't care.
And are we gonna live in peace, and all live free, you'll see.
O Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe-
"
15,11,Randy,"Shelly? Shelly?  Shelly, come on. We have to go!
"
15,11,Shelly,"Dad, what are you doing here?
"
15,11,Randy,"Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!
"
15,11,Elderly Man,"Would you mind?! I'm trying to enjoy this musical with my granddaughter!

15,11,Randy,"Oh you fucking pervert!
"
15,11,Usher,"Alright, get the hell out of here, you! 
"
15,11,Randy,"Shelly! 
"
15,11,Sharon,"Randy!  Randy, what are you doing?!
"
15,11,Randy,"It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! 
"
15,11,The Wizard,"While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!
"
15,11,Singers,"Take me away to that special place (that blowjob place)
Where people like us can all live free (Free to give blowjobs)
Take me away and let's live together
That's the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me
"
15,11,Audience,"Ohhhh.
"
15,11,Audience Member,"Hey, it's Spider-Man
"
15,11,Randy,"Sorry! Sorry.
"
15,11,Randy,"Agh! 
"
15,11,Announcer,"Sorry folks, we are in a hold. We are in a hold.
"
15,11,Audience,"Awwwwww. 
"
15,11,Field Reporter,"The musical came to a screeching halt as patrons flooded out the exits and water flooded the theater.  The only fatality was a young boy who could not get out of the theater in time. The fire chief said it was unfortunate the child was not wearing a life preserver. 
"
15,11,Randy,"Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. 
"
15,11,Randy,"It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy!  I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you.  I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.
"
15,11,Sharon,"I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
"
15,11,Randy,"Really?
"
15,11,Sharon,"Oh Randy,  the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh Sharon, you're the best. 
"
15,11,Sharon,"So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?
"
15,11,Randy,"I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.

15,12,Board Rep,"Last week the students of this school participated in the Presidential Fitness Test. I'm sad to announce that South Park Elementary scored the lowest in health and fitness in the entire country.  On the whole, you students actually scored fine. But the President's Fitness Test is scored on a school-wide average, and one fourth grader at this school scored so low, with a terrifying body fat score, , and high blood pressure and the cholesterol levels of a seventy-year-old man, that it actually brought you entire school's average down to the lowest in the country.  However, the Presidential Fitness Program never wants to single out one child, because then that child might feel bad. And so as far as we're concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs.
"
15,12,Principal Victoria,"Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?
"
15,12,Board Rep,"Sorry. As far as the board is concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs. And so it is the recommendation of this board that every week, each class will alternate turns, giving up their recesses and instead reporting to PE.
"
15,12,Assembly,"AWWW!
"
15,12,Coach,"Alright, fourth grade class, you're up first. We're gonna do some rope-climbin'.
"
15,12,Stan,"God this sucks!
"
15,12,Kyle,"Four weeks we gotta do this?
"
15,12,Cartman,"Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. 
"
15,12,Coach,"Alright McCormick, let's start with you. Climb the rope. 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. 
"
15,12,Coach,"Alright, let's go Broflovski. 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
"
15,12,Stan,"Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
"
15,12,Stan,"Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
"
15,12,Craig,"Yeah. We're paying for your being fat.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
"
15,12,Wendy,"We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
"
15,12,Clyde,"Oh grow up.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
"
15,12,Stan,"That's what we mean by ""grow up"" dude! Stop being a baby!
"
15,12,Craig,"Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
"
15,12,Clyde Frog,"But Eric, you are cool.
"
15,12,Cartman,"I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
"
15,12,Peter Panda,"It's not your fault, Eric. How can they blame you for what is clearly President Obama's fault?
"
15,12,Cartman,"What do you mean, Peter Panda?
"
15,12,Peter Panda,"You didn't make that stupid Presidential Fitness Test. Obama did.
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Yeah, that's right Eric. You don't need to grow up. You are awesome and keeewl.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
"
15,12,Butters,"Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
"
15,12,Stan,"Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
"
15,12,Butters,"Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
"
15,12,Cartman,"What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! 
"
15,12,Butters,"Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
"
15,12,Jimmy,"Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit.
"
15,12,Fifth Grader,"Yeah. The fifth graders agree. We're all being punished for one lazy bitch. Let's make him suffer.
"
15,12,Jimmy,"All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy.
"
15,12,Jimmy,"Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary.
"
15,12,Board Rep,"Aahh yes, the Fatty Boombalatty class. How's the extra PE treating you?
"
15,12,Butters,"Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
"
15,12,Board Rep,"What do you want me to do about it?
"
15,12,Jimmy,"Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate.
"
15,12,Board Rep,"'Fraid that's impossible. The National Fitness Test has very specific standards. No one child can ever be made to feel singled out. We don't even like to use the term ""physically fit"" anymore because it can make a student feel unphysically fit, and then that student might end up feeling like a total retard.
"
15,12,Jimmy,"...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?
"
15,12,Board Rep,"A-and then that fourth grader might end up feeling like a total retard.
"
15,12,Butters,"Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
"
15,12,Jimmy,"All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Mom, have you been here all day?!
"
15,12,Liane,"No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?
"
15,12,Cartman,"Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
"
15,12,Liane,"Are you sure, sweetie?
"
15,12,Cartman,"Am I sure?? Look at this place!
"
15,12,Liane,"But who would want to s-
"
15,12,Cartman,"Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-   Oh my God.  Clyde Frog!
"
15,12,Liane,"What?
"
15,12,Cartman,"No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog! 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG! 
"
15,12,Cartman,"I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, ""I'm not getting away with this, am I?"" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
"
15,12,Kyle,"Shut the hell up, Cartman!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Got something to say Kyle?! 
"
15,12,Kyle,"How do you murder a stuffed animal?!
"
15,12,Cartman,"How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
"
15,12,Craig,"Where's our five dollars?
"
15,12,Cartman,"Fly bu-what?
"
15,12,Craig,"It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.
"
15,12,Stan,"Yeah.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
"
15,12,Class,"AWWW! 
"
15,12,Kid 1,"Come on!
"
15,12,Kid 2,"Screw this.
"
15,12,Kid 4,"Hurry up, screw this.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.
"
15,12,Receptionist,"Sir? Sir, do you remember the kids from that South Park Elementary School?
"
15,12,Board Rep,"Oh yes, the Boom Boom Chubby Choom Choom school.
"
15,12,Receptionist,"They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them.
"
15,12,Board Rep,"Oh my Jesus! Oh, not a 99% rally.
"
15,12,Butters,"I sure hope this works.
"
15,12,Field Reporter 1,"Tom, I'm reporting from the middle of a protest where two fourth grade students are fed up, and have decided to occupy Red Robin. Occupy Red Robin has been going on for several hours now, and boys, technically I am part of the 99% so, what do I have to say about all this? 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
"
15,12,Peter Panda,"Why would somebody do such a terrible thing?
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Why would somebody hurt Clyde Frog, Eric? Especially because you are so awesome and keewl.
"
15,12,Cartman,"I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
"
15,12,Rumpertumskin,"Let's stop the charades, Eric, and let's get down to business.
"
15,12,Cartman,"What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?
"
15,12,Rumpertumskin,"We all know who fuckin' killed Clyde Frog, and she's the same dirty slut who's been fucking with us our whole lives!
"
15,12,Liane,"Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Does everything look okay?
"
15,12,Peter Panda,"Sit down, you fucking bitch.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
"
15,12,Liane,"Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Shut your fat piehole, bitch!
"
15,12,Rumpertumskin,"Yeah! You know what you did, skank! You let Clyde Frog get murdered!
"
15,12,Liane,"No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear.
"
15,12,Muscleman Marc,"Then why did you write in your diary ""It was probably time for Eric to grow out of his stuffed animals"" anyway?!
"
15,12,Cartman,"That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
"
15,12,Muscleman Marc,"Well, all I'm saying, Eric, is that-
"
15,12,Liane,"Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-
"
15,12,Muscleman Marc,"ALL I'M SAYING, ERIC, is that you went through your mom's diary for a reason!
"
15,12,Liane,"Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.
"
15,12,Cartman,"So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
"
15,12,Sgt. Yates,"You'd better give me every cop you've got on the South Side! I don't care where ABC parks their truck, as long as it doesn't block the fire trucks!  Jesus, this protest is getting out of hand! Alright, what exactly are we dealing with?
"
15,12,Officer 1,"It's no good. The protest has quadrupled in size since this morning. As you can see from this aerial photograph, the protest covers almost two square miles. We have right officers here, here, and here. The media has been contained in this area. 
"
15,12,Sgt. Yates,"And where are the actual protesters?
"
15,12,Officer 1,"Oh, these two people right here. 
"
15,12,Sgt. Yates,"How are we gonna contain this ting?!
"
15,12,Officer 2,"I'm afraid it's about to get worse. You see this area here? This is where we're setting up the stage for Bon Jovi.
"
15,12,Sgt. Yates,"Bon Jovi?
"
15,12,Officer 2,"These are good cops! We can't have them standing around for hours without some entertainment! The problem is, with this area blocked by napping tents, we have no place to serve the officers beer.
"
15,12,Sgt. Yates,"Damnit! Don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards?  Full-on class warfare.
"
15,12,Cartman,"What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
"
15,12,Fireman 1,"The fire started with this. Definitely a case of arson. Somebody hates this kid.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!
"
15,12,Peter Panda,"Eh, Eric.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
"
15,12,Peter Panda,"Eric... Remember...  Stay... keeewl. 
"
15,12,Fireman 2,"Sorry kid, we need to take this as evidence.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
"
15,12,Female Reporter,"The 99%ers movement continues to grow as more and more Americans occupy Red Robin. I asked some of the people exactly what they hoped to accomplish.  And sir, what do you hope to accomplish by this movement?
"
15,12,Patron,"I like the uh, A1 Peppercorn Burger. And they got ummm, bo-bottomless fries.
"
15,12,Female Reporter,"And as the protesters inside Red Robin unite together, word is that filmmaker Michael Moore has joined the protesters outside.
"
15,12,Michael Moore,"I look at the faces of you protesters and I see the future of America! We are the 99%! YESSS!!
"
15,12,Kyle,"Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?
"
15,12,Fifth Grader,"Maybe we are and maybe we aren't. You got any proof?
"
15,12,Stan,"Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?
"
15,12,Fifth Grader,"That doesn't prove anything. That fat little fuck is finally getting what's coming to him.
"
15,12,Kyle,"Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.
"
15,12,Fifth Grader,"He's in your class but you don't deal with him! So we are gonna remedy the situation! We've got big plans! Just stay out of our way and let the men handle this! 
"
15,12,Liane,"Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.
"
15,12,Bob,"Of course. You can't be staying in a home with that much fire damage.
"
15,12,Linda,"To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.
"
15,12,Liane,"I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.
"
15,12,Cartman,"This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
"
15,12,Token,"Why are you involving me in this?
"
15,12,Cartman,"Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
"
15,12,Field Reporter 2,"Breaking news from the Occupy Red Robin movement. The protesters have decreased in number from two to one, as one of the protesters has apparently splintered off from the group to start a new movement: Occupy the Restroom.
"
15,12,Field Reporter 1,"Tom, Occupy the Restroom has been going on for almost thirty minutes now. Certainly a sign that this country is more divided than ever. These 99%ers are fed up,  and as a result you can clearly see this restroom is ""OCCUPIED.""  Uh, Tom, it looks like the movement is finished, but from the time it took, it must have been a pretty decent-sized movement.
"
15,12,Token,"Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?
"
15,12,Cartman,"What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
"
15,12,Token,"This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
"
15,12,Token,"You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!
"
15,12,Token,"That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.
"
15,12,Cartman,"What?! Who?!
"
15,12,Token,"I don't know.
"
15,12,Cartman,"I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here! 
"
15,12,Token,"A motion detector. 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
"
15,12,Kyle,"It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Oh sure!
"
15,12,Stan,"Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!
"
15,12,Kenny,"(I don't really know!)
"
15,12,Cartman,"HAAAAGH! 
"
15,12,Stan,"Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
"
15,12,Cartman,"I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?! 
"
15,12,Stephen Tamil,"Alright guys. You ready?
"
15,12,Classmates,"Ready!
"
15,12,Stephen Tamil,"Here we GO! 
"
15,12,Butters,"Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?
"
15,12,Stephen Tamil,"We are the 83%! We are tired of being punished for the fourth grade class! The fourth grade is stickin' it to the other 83% of the school!
"
15,12,Jimmy,"Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%.
"
15,12,Butters,"Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
"
15,12,Stephen Tamil,"Because your class had Cartman in it, and he's the 1%!
"
15,12,Jimmy,"But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%.
"
15,12,Field Reporter 3,"This is it. The inevitable has happened at Occupy Red Robin. It is full-on class warfare.
"
15,12,Female Reporter 2,"And now class warfare is breaking out. Apparently it is the fourth grade class versus the fifth grade class.
"
15,12,Sgt. Yates,"It's here! The class warfare is finally here!
"
15,12,Officer 2,"Yeeah!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Hello??  Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin!  Jesus Christ! 
"
15,12,Rumpertumskin,"Eric! Don't come any closer!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Who did this to you?!
"
15,12,Rumpertumskin,"You said you wouldn't let anything happen to us.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Don't worry, I'll get you down!
"
15,12,Rumpertumskin,"No Eric, don't come any- 
"
15,12,Cartman,"AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"It's okay, Eric. It's over now. 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Don't you see? The kids at school were right, Eric. It was time for us to grow up.
"
15,12,Cartman,"...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! 
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Yes, they're gone. And now we can grow up and be together.
"
15,12,Cartman,"They were your FRIENDS!
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"They were holding us back! All the kids making fun of you at school, saying you're not keewl! Your stuffed animals all have to be gotten rid of, don't you see?!
"
15,12,Bob,"Dead-bolted. Token!  Token, you in there?! 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"No, I thought of everything! It all happened here so that everyone would think Token did it. All the blame will be on him. And we can live happily ever after.
"
15,12,Cartman,"There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Oh no! You're totally right! But I thought my plan was perfect! I failed! I failed you! You have to kill me Eric! So that you don't get blamed!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"It's the only way Eric. You have to do it. Please! I can't live with myself after what I've done. Please, you have to do it Eric.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.
"
15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Say ""hello"" to the sunrise for me. 
"
15,12,Stan,"Dude, what the hell?
"
15,12,Kyle,"We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
"
15,12,Liane,"My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. 
"
15,12,Field Reporter 3,"Occupy Red Robin is over. Class warfare has torn apart the 99% and replaced it with the 30%, the 26%, and even little brackets of 5%s here and there. What does this mean for our country? What oes this mean... for me?
"
15,12,Officer 2,"Hey! Get down to State Street! They're occupying Macaroni Grill!
"
15,12,Field Reporter 3,"Oh hell yeah! I'll occupy me some goat-cheese peppadew peppers! 
"
15,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's all take our seats.  As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American.
"
15,13,Butters,"Oh neato, huh fellas?
"
15,13,Guest,"Hello boys and girls. My name is David Running Horse... Sawitsky, and I am one sixteenth Cherokee Indian.
"
15,13,Cartman,"Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? 
"
15,13,Sawitsky,"There've been a lot of ""stories"" about the first Thanksgiving, and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the Pilgrims look good, and my people being degraded as usual. Was Thanksgiving about turkey and peace? Or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race?
"
15,13,Butters,"Thanksgiving is about murder?
"
15,13,Cartman,"This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
"
15,13,Kyle,"Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
"
15,13,Cartman,"Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
"
15,13,Cartman,"Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
"
15,13,Stan,"We all have to do this report together, dude.
"
15,13,Cartman,"You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
"
15,13,Kyle,"How is that gonna help?!
"
15,13,Cartman,"Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
"
15,13,Announcer,"You're watching The History Channel, where the truth is history.
"
15,13,Narrator,"A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?
"
15,13,Cartman,"Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
"
15,13,Narrator,"We know the first Thanksgiving was in the fall of 1621, but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the Pilgrims and Native Americans may have been visited by aliens! 
"
15,13,Duncan Everton,"In every journal entry we researched from those early Pilgrims, not one entry mentioned anything about aliens not being there.
"
15,13,Narrator,"And what about the food?  Does the appearance of stuffing at the first Thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology? 
"
15,13,Cartman,"Uh-huh??
"
15,13,Kyle,"What? This isn't history.
"
15,13,Stan,"Dude, it is called History Channel.
"
15,13,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
15,13,Charles Biggens,"And if we look in all the journals and aall the history books, there is no reference to stuffing before 1621. So where did it come from? Did it come from space? We just don't know.
"
15,13,Narrator,"Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form?  What exactly did the Pilgrims experience?  How exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every November? 
"
15,13,Kyle,"What??
"
15,13,Cartman,"Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
"
15,13,Kyle,"We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
"
15,13,Cartman,"Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 
"
15,13,Kyle,"Dude!
"
15,13,Cartman,"Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? 
"
15,13,Kyle,"Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!
"
15,13,THC President,"Yes? A report from where?  Does Congress know about this yet? Try to keep it contained and get the helicopters ready. I'll be there as soon as I can. 
"
15,13,Wife,"Darling?
"
15,13,THC President,"They found something. This could be it. 
"
15,13,Cartman,"Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
"
15,13,Stan,"...What?
"
15,13,Cartman,"Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!
"
15,13,Cartman,"See what I mean, you guys? 
"
15,13,Agent 1,"Is that them?
"
15,13,Agent 2,"That's them.
"
15,13,THC President,"You boys have been very busy...  We need to know everything that you know.
"
15,13,Stan,"'bout what?
"
15,13,THC President,"Have you been contacted by alien life forms?
"
15,13,Agent 1,"Did you come across some kind of ship or something?
"
15,13,Kyle,"Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.
"
15,13,THC President,"We are The History Channel.  For years we've been collecting information on Thanksgiving. We're getting close to the truth. And now you boys have exactly the same information. It can't be coincidence.
"
15,13,Kyle,"We saw it on your channel.
"
15,13,THC President,"What exactly did you seez?!
"
15,13,Stan,"That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
"
15,13,THC President,"My God. Would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview?
"
15,13,Steven,"Alright, Butters, that's enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain. I'm putting on History Channel.
"
15,13,Butters,"Okay Dad.
"
15,13,Announcer,"You're watching the History Channel, the only network dedicated to history. Coming up next, it's Monster Quest! Larrh! Followed by Hairy Bikers. Errh! But now, back to Part 3 of Ancient Aliens at Thanksgiving.
"
15,13,Narrator,"It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings.
"
15,13,Stan Marsh,"Stuffing wasn't mentioned anywhere until 1621? And it might have been... alien technology?
"
15,13,Narrator,"And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?
"
15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Of course you can't prove there were no aliens at the first Thanksgiving! Just like you can't ""prove"" that... the Pilgrims themselves weren't alien! Can you prove that?! Here: draw that Thanksgiving turkey symbol with your hand! Maybe that symbol matches... galaxies in space or something! OooOoOoOooOOO! 
"
15,13,Narrator,"Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say ""yes.""
"
15,13,Kyle,"You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
"
15,13,Stan,"Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. 
"
15,13,Kyle,"How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. 
"
15,13,Sawitsky,"What are you doing?!
"
15,13,Kyle,"...Uh oh.
"
15,13,Sawitsky,"The first Thanksgiving was a space treaty?! Native Americans are aliens?!
"
15,13,Kyle,"I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
"
15,13,Sawitsky,"Haven't my people been through enough?!  Goddamn you!
"
15,13,Kyle,"Ack dude! 
"
15,13,Sawitsky,"The white man is gonna PAY for his lies! 
"
15,13,Agent 2,"Look at this, sir!  An aerial photograph of Cape Cod where the Pilgrims landed in 1620.  Five Pilgrim settlements, with Plymouth Rock here.  The same symbols appear everywhere in history. 
"
15,13,Agent 1,"The symbology lines up to mirrored points in space. If Kyle Broflovski is right, then Plymouth Rock is some kind of wormhole.
"
15,13,THC President,"Pilgrims and Indians were the aliens! How did we not think of it?!
"
15,13,Agent 3,"Sometimes it takes the innocence of a child to make us see the most simple things.
"
15,13,Agent 2,"True dat.
"
15,13,THC President,"True dat.
"
15,13,THC President,"Get all those tourists out of here! We need this place secured!
"
15,13,Agent 4,"Alight people, let's clear out! We need you ALL to disperse!  This area is under quarantine. 
"
15,13,THC President,"Give me a piece of chalk.  Huh... Nothing.
"
15,13,Agent 5,"Guess Kyle Broflovski was wrong.
"
15,13,THC President,"Well, at least we weren't outsmarted by a nine-year-old kid.  We should've known. Pilgrims couldn't be from space.
"
15,13,Agent 6,"Here. You can see it right there. An object clearly fell from the sky and struck the Earth.
"
15,13,THC President,"What is it?
"
15,13,Agent 6,"It's a Pilgrim, sir. 
"
15,13,THC President,"So then, Professor Broflovski was right after all. 
"
15,13,Narrator,"Not long ago, it was an accepted fact that civilizations on Earth shared the universe with beings from other planets.  These alien beings visited our world, and once, even settled it, from deep within the galaxy Canis Major, and a distant planet called... Plymouth. 
"
15,13,Pilgrim King,"Fellow Pilgrims! The great Captain hath gone missing and thine enemies have attacked our stuffing mines! We must prepare for war with the Indians!
"
15,13,Indian Chief,"Now it is OUR time! We shall attack Plymouth, and we will take... ALL THEIR STUFFING! 
"
15,13,Cartman,"Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
"
15,13,Liane,"What hon?
"
15,13,Cartman,"Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
"
15,13,Liane,"Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.
"
15,13,Cartman,"Oh no. Oh NO!
"
15,13,Liane,"What is it, hon?
"
15,13,Cartman,"Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! 
"
15,13,Cartman,"You guys have stuffing?!
"
15,13,Attendant 1,"Stuffing? Sure. Aisle 17.
"
15,13,Cartman,"Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!
"
15,13,Attendant 1,"It's right there, right on the uh...  wait, that can't be right. Hey, hey Chet. What happened to all the stuffing?
"
15,13,Chet,"What are you talking about? 
"
15,13,Attendant 1,"We got more in the back, right?
"
15,13,Chet,"I just did inventory in the back, it... it was all put out here!
"
15,13,Attendant 1,"You mean it's two weeks until Thanksgiving and we're completely out of stuffing?!
"
15,13,Chet,"Oh no!
"
15,13,Cartman,"No!
"
15,13,Chet,"No!
"
15,13,Cartman,"NO!
"
15,13,Pilgrim King,"You dare come to Plymouth, ambassador?! After attacking our stuffing mines?!
"
15,13,Indian Chief,"The stuffing mines were never yours!
"
15,13,Pilgrim King,"Wihtout control of the mines we cannot supply stuffing to the mortals, ambassador! This will be war!
"
15,13,Indian Chief,"You are in no position to declare war! Your lead commander is nowhere to be found!
"
15,13,Pilgrim King,"And how knoweth you that?!
"
15,13,Indian Chief,"Word travels fast in our sector.
"
15,13,Pilgrim King,"I do not give free bowls of stuffing, what sayest you?! We will take back control of the stuffing mines! 
"
15,13,Indian Chief,"Then the Thanksgiving treaty will be off! 
"
15,13,Pilgrim King,"And I pray to stuffing that you are wrong.  Where are you, Miles Standish?
"
15,13,Sawitzky,"And furthermore, everything Kyle Broflovski said about Native Americans being from outer space was untrue! Native Americans were brutalized, and David Sawitzky's ancestors deserve an apology! It was wrong to mix aliens and real history!
"
15,13,Stan,"I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
"
15,13,Kyle,"Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!
"
15,13,Stan,"I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
"
15,13,Kenny,"(Yeah, that's true.)
"
15,13,Kyle,"Would you guys stop!
"
15,13,Sawitsky,"Just keep writing your apology! 
"
15,13,Miles,"How now, Indian?! Why hast thy race sent me here to Earth?!
"
15,13,Sawitsky,"Huh?  Ack.
"
15,13,Stan,"Dude!
"
15,13,Miles,"You Indians took me to thy planet, and then cast me here! Why?! 
"
15,13,Kenny,"(Go, dude!)
"
15,13,Stan,"Yeah, go on dude!
"
15,13,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
15,13,Miles,"Hast thy race attacked our stuffing mines and sent me here to die?! Tell me, Indian!
"
15,13,Sawitzky,"I I uh I'm only one sixteenth.
"
15,13,Miles,"Hold your lying tongue!  This shall prove if thou art Indian or not!  Ah, he was not.
"
15,13,Stan,"I didn't think so.
"
15,13,Miles,"I have been told of your expertise, Kyle of DeVry Institute. I need your wisdom to get back to my planet.
"
15,13,Miles,"Into the wheeled chariot that strucketh me!  We must make haste to Cape Cod! 
"
15,13,Stan,"Who's this?
"
15,13,Miles,"This is Natalie.
"
15,13,Natalie,"Hi guys.
"
15,13,Agent 7,"Alright, sir. We got some more information on the Pilgrim who crashed to Earth. Thirty seconds after impact the Pilgrim was hit by a truck and then put into the back seat.
"
15,13,THC President,"Who did the truck belong to?
"
15,13,Agent 6,"We believe it belonged to Natalie Portman, sir.
"
15,13,THC President,"The actress? That doesn't make sense.
"
15,13,Agent 8,"It gets worse. All over the country people are reporting a shortage of stuffing. We don't think it's coincidence.
"
15,13,THC President,"You're telling me that somehow during a stuffing shortage, this ""Pilgrim"" dropped down from space and got into a truck driven by Natalie Portman?!
"
15,13,Agent 9,"Look, if anyone knows about stuffing, it's Natalie Portman!
"
15,13,THC President,"We have to find Professor Broflovski. He was right about all of this. He'll know what to do.
"
15,13,Miles,"We shall make camp here for the night. On the morrow perhaps we can reach Cape Cod. And Thanksgiving may yet be saved.  What is wrong with Kyle of DeVry Institute?
"
15,13,Stan,"Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
"
15,13,Miles,"He seems almost like a Puritan lady whose period hath stopped.  I fear, Kyle, that you still do not know whose side to be on.
"
15,13,Kyle,"No, ah I don't.
"
15,13,Miles,"It must have been very difficult for you, being the one on your planet with his wild theories that Pilgrims and Indians were not of this world.
"
15,13,Kyle,"I actually only just said that sarcastically.
"
15,13,Miles,"HA1 Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Then you are only just a remarkably gifted child!  Here, let me show you. Your planet is one of the five.  Plymouth, Indi, Colthenheim, and this planet over here nobody really cares about.  The five are connected by a series of wormholes.  My people came to your world, and so did our enemies. But we made a treaty, and for 300 years our people have not fought. But now, the treaty is over.
"
15,13,Kyle,"But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.
"
15,13,Miles,"You can't believe what everyone tells you, Kyle. You have to open your eyes.  Soon your wisdom will open the wormhole back to Plymouth, and the stuffing mines can again be ours, for he who controls the stuffing, controls the universe. 
"
15,13,A pilot,"Hold it right there! 
"
15,13,Agent 10,"We found Professor Broflovski! He is with the Pilgrim! 
"
15,13,Miles,"Stay back, all of you! For I will get to Cape Cod and cannot be stopped! Come boys! Let us fight to the death!
"
15,13,THC President,"Wait! Stop, stop! Please, Mr. Standish, we are all on the same side here. We know why there's a stuffing shortage. We've been trying to get the wormhole open.
"
15,13,Miles,"I trust none but them!  Indians hath betrayed us! I must return to Plymouth so my king can know the truth! 
"
15,13,THC President,"PLEASE!  We're the History Channel. We care as much about the truth as you do.
"
15,13,Miles,"Then get us to Cape Cod as soon as possible!
"
15,13,Pilgrim,"My Lord! My Lord, the battle is lost! We have tried to stop the Indians on their home planet, but yea they are too strong!
"
15,13,Pilgrim King,"Then our last chance for survival is gone?
"
15,13,Pilgrim,"I'm sorry my Lord. All Pilgrim forces sent to the Indians' planet have been wiped out.
"
15,13,Pilgrim King,"And so soon the Indians will be here. Sound the corn horn! We must abandon Plymouth!
"
15,13,Indian Chief,"The stuffing mines are ours! 
"
15,13,Miles,"Earth is connected to Plymouth by this wormhole here. Once I get back I will assemble my people to attack Indi, and gain control of the stuffing mines. If all goes as planned, you will all have stuffing in time for Thanksgiving.
"
15,13,THC President,"But Mr. Standish, I'm afraid it's not that simple. We... tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didn't work.
"
15,13,Miles,"Ah ha ha ha! Of course not! You have the correct symbol, but you are missing the keeper of the portal.
"
15,13,Agent 11,"The keeper of the... of course! Natalie Portman!
"
15,13,THC President,"We were wondering what she had to do with all this! Natalie Portman controls the wormhole!
"
15,13,Agent 12,"Our window of opportunity is closing, sir! The wormhole has to be opened now!
"
15,13,THC President,"Alright Ms. Portman, we need you to open your wormhole.
"
15,13,Natalie,"Mmmmmmmmmm. No.
"
15,13,THC President,"Please, Ms. Portman, you've got to open your wormhole right now!
"
15,13,Natalie,"Mmmmmmm.  Uh uh.
"
15,13,THC President,"Curses and cranberries! I must get to Plymouth now! Do as they say!
"
15,13,Natalie,"Mmmmmmmmmm. No.
"
15,13,THC President,"There has to be a way to get the portal open! Where's our expert?!  What do we do, Professor Broflovski?
"
15,13,Kyle,"I'm not a professor.
"
15,13,THC President,"The History Channel said you were!
"
15,13,Kyle,"You are the fucking History Channel!
"
15,13,Miles,"Please, Kyle of DeVry Institute. There is no more time for squabbles. The universe is at stake!
"
15,13,THC President,"You knew everything else. You somehow knew about all of this. You knew it... here.  You must know... how to get Natalie Portman to open her wormhole.
"
15,13,Kyle,"So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?
"
15,13,Natalie,"I had a lot of really close friends growing up, but not any brothers and sisters; I was an only child.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Wow, awesome. Um...
"
15,13,Natalie,"I have dual citizenship in the United States and Israel.  Oh thanks.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.
"
15,13,Natalie,"Well, I went to Harvard while I was acting. I got a BA. But I did classes at the University of Jerusalem too.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?
"
15,13,Natalie,"Thanks, that was a lot of fun.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd
"
15,13,Natalie,"What?
"
15,13,Kyle,"You know, could youuu...
"
15,13,Natalie,"What?
"
15,13,Kyle,"Would you please just open your wormhole?!
"
15,13,Natalie,"Oh.  Mmmm...  no.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Errh!
"
15,13,Natalie,"Mmmmmmmmmm. Okay.
"
15,13,Miles,"Yes!
"
15,13,THC President,"Alright, let's go, folks! 
"
15,13,Natalie,"Just for a sec though. 
"
15,13,Miles,"Thank you, Kyle of DeVry Institute. Now the Indians can be stopped and Thanksgiving will be saved!
"
15,13,Kyle,"Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. 
"
15,13,Stan,"It's cool dude, we understand.
"
15,13,Kyle,"I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. 
"
15,13,Miles,"Now make way, children! For I have a war to fight!  For stuffing!! 
"
15,13,Indian Chief,"Take ALL their stuffing!
"
15,13,Pilgrim,"The treaty ends now! 
"
15,13,Narrator,"With the wormhole once again open, Miles Standish was finally able to command a Pilgrim army.
"
15,13,Miles,"Now attack their left flank! Good! They're retreating! Hit them with the anti-Indian device! 
"
15,13,Narrator,"The Pilgrims fought off the Indians, making stuffing once again available on all our Thanksgiving tables.
"
15,13,Random Voices,"Yea. Stuffing mines. Yea.
"
15,13,Narrator,"And now you know the true story behind Thanksgiving.
"
15,13,Stan,"Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
"
15,13,Cartman,"Yeah, History Channel rules.
"
15,13,Narrator,"But was the first Thanksgiving really just about Pilgrims and Indians from space? Or was there something more? Shocking new evidence suggests that the first Thanksgiving might also have been...  haunted!
"
15,13,Donald T. Brown,"There is certainly no evidence that the first Thanksgiving dinner was not haunted.
"
15,13,Narrator,"The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave? 
"
15,13,Cartman,"Uhhh??
"
15,13,Kyle,"Oh, come on!!
"
15,14,Stuart,"You think you're man enough to fight me, you little shit?!
"
15,14,Kevin,"Yes, 'cause you're a drunk piece of shit, Dad!
"
15,14,Mrs. McCormick,"You're both drunk pieces of shit! Both of you sit the fuck down!
"
15,14,Kevin,"Shoot him!
"
15,14,Announcer,"They're noisy.
"
15,14,Man 1,"Fuck you, bitch! 
"
15,14,Woman 1,"Fuck you, you son of a bitch! 
"
15,14,Announcer,"They're nasty.
"
15,14,Woman 2,"You done spilled that on my titties, skank! 
"
15,14,Woman 3,"Oww...
"
15,14,Announcer,"They're white trash. And when you give them a little Pabst Blue Ribbon , they can't help getting arrested.  Tonight, on an all-new... White Trash... In Trouble!
"
15,14,Narrator,"Pabst Blue Ribbon and white trash. It's a deadly combination that can lead to prison time and children being taken away from their home.  This white trash home in Colorado seems innocent enough. 
"
15,14,Kenny,"(Hmmm. What the fuck?) 
"
15,14,Narrator,"But the children in this home live in a world of neglect. There's no heating, no groceries,  and if you look closely in the backyard, you can even make out what appears to be a meth lab. 
"
15,14,Kenny,"(Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!) 
"
15,14,Cops,"Down on the ground! Move it! Let's go! Move move! Get down, now! 
"
15,14,Mrs. McCormick,"No! Muh babies! Don't take my babies!
"
15,14,Stuart,"You're hurting my arm!
"
15,14,Mrs. McCormick,"My babies!
"
15,14,Stuart,"You're hurting me!
"
15,14,Officer 1,"You have the right to remain silent. Now please look at the camera and say ""I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.""
"
15,14,Stuart,"I'm white trash and I'm in trouble. 
"
15,14,Officer 1,"Alright, good. Now get in the car! 
"
15,14,Cartman,"Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
"
15,14,Officer 2,"Just have a seat in there, kids. 
"
15,14,Kevin,"Just have a seat in there, kids. 
"
15,14,Officer 1,"The mother and father will probably be released from jail on Monday, but I guess the kids are gonna be taken away for good. Child Protective Services is about to talk to them in the soft room.
"
15,14,Officer 3,"The soft room?
"
15,14,Officer 1,"You know, the room we have set aside for kids to feel safe in.
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"Hi kids, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams and I just need to get some info from you. Does that sound okay?
"
15,14,Karen,"Can I see my mommy?
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"No, sorry. Now,  I've been looking over your file and I see you kids have all been horribly physically and emotionally abused.  Oh whoops, that isn't your case file, it's the Penn State University Gazette.  I'm joking, that's just a joke, we like to have fun here.  It is your case file. I was just all like ""it's the Penn State Gazette"" to be like a joke, we have fun. Now listen, you're gonna be put into a foster home, so I need to know... would you like to go to Neverland Ranch, a Catholic church, or Penn State University?  We're havin' fun here, aren't we? I just, I come up with these and the guys, it's good to laugh.  I just asked them if they wanted to go to Neverland, a Catholic church, or Penn State.  I'm a trickster. People say I'm really meant for comedy. Here's my head shot just in case you know anybody.  Can't hurt, right? Okay, now, are we all startin' to feel a little bit better?  Oh come on now, how about that smile? I'm gonna GET  you to smile! I'm gonna GET  you to smile!  A Penn State administrator walks into a bar. Where's that smile? How about this one? Joe Paterno doesn't walk into a police station. Come on, that's a good one.
"
15,14,Stan,"Did you hear anything more about what happened?
"
15,14,Kyle,"Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
"
15,14,Stan,"We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
"
15,14,Stan,"Really?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
"
15,14,Kyle,"That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? 
"
15,14,Craig,"What are you talking about?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. 
"
15,14,Officer 2,"Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, we have the new foster kids for your care. 
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"Very good, we'll take them from here. Children, enter.  Welcome to your new home. Before we show you around let's get one thing clear: this is a very strict religious household! As long as you live here you will be agnostic!  These are your foster brothers and sisters! They are all strict agnostics! David, do you believe in God?!
"
15,14,David,"I don't know...
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"Right! There are two bedrooms upstairs! Boys' room and girls' room! Your chores are listed on their respective doors! Follow!  You will eat only at designated meal times! Beverages you may take from the refrigerator as you like! However, in this house you will drink only agnostic beverages!  Dr Pep-er, and Diet Dr Pep-er!  Because what flavor is it?! It is neither root beer nor cola! Nobody is sure what flavor it is, and nobody can be sure! Isn't that right, Melissa?!
"
15,14,Melissa,"I don't know.
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"Good!
"
15,14,Cartman,"This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
"
15,14,Butters,"Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Eh yeah?
"
15,14,Butters,"So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Heh heh, yeah?
"
15,14,Butters,"Well actually, Eric, it's you. 
"
15,14,Cartman,"What?
"
15,14,Butters,"Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
"
15,14,Butters,"Uh, I won't tell anybody.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
"
15,14,Kyle,"My name. Is not. ""Kyel.""
"
15,14,Cartman,"That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! 
"
15,14,Liane,"Hi, sweetie.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.
"
15,14,Liane,"Oh, what is it this time? 
"
15,14,Cartman,"Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
"
15,14,Liane,"What, hon?
"
15,14,Cartman,"You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
"
15,14,Liane,"Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!
"
15,14,Liane,"Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.
"
15,14,Cartman,"We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
"
15,14,Liane,"Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
"
15,14,Liane,"Oh. 
"
15,14,Cartman,"IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! 
"
15,14,Cartman,"My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
"
15,14,Karen,"Huh?  Oh, it's you.  I was wondering when you'd appear. You always come when I'm sad.
"
15,14,Mysterion,"You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that!
"
15,14,Karen,"Why did my mommy and daddy go to jail?
"
15,14,Mysterion,"Sometimes, people do stupid things. Sometimes they don't realize what should have come first. Until it's too late.
"
15,14,Karen,"But I'm all alone now.
"
15,14,Mysterion,"You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?
"
15,14,Karen,"I'll try, guardian angel.
"
15,14,Mysterion,"Don't try, Karen. Do. 
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"What in the name of nobody knows are you doing, Karen?! 
"
15,14,Officer 4,"Police man.  Yes. Yes. Alright, thanks for the tip. We'll check it out.  Better call the lieutenant. Looks like we've got another meth lab in town.
"
15,14,Officer 5,"Got any needles on you? Any crack pipes?
"
15,14,Liane,"Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.
"
15,14,Officer 5,"Then why is there a meth lab in your backyard?
"
15,14,Cartman,"What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
"
15,14,Officer 5,"When will you people learn to lay off the Pabst Blue Ribbon? Now look at the camera and say ""I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.""
"
15,14,Liane,"Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"Hi there, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams, and I'm with Child Protective Services.  Here's my head shot.  I just need to get some information from you if that's okay.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah.
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"Okay, now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab.
"
15,14,Cartman,"That's right.
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime? Because at Penn State they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. That's a joke. Did you get that one? It's a play on words, we like to have fun here.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"We just - no, we just like to have fun here.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! 
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"What? What, is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You think you're funny?
"
15,14,Cartman,"A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"Could be worse.
"
15,14,Cartman,"How?!
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"Could be in Happy Valley! On a scale from 1 to 10, how old should you be to stay away from Penn State?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"Two Penn State administrators walk into a butt-!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
"
15,14,Officer 6,"Hawaii?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
"
15,14,Officer 7,"Your foster home is here, pretty much the exact opposite of Hawaii.
"
15,14,Cartman,"What??  Greeley?
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"Come on now! This is not the way we told you to tidy up! Remember? Cleanliness is next to godliness, so make it kind of clean but not too much! Amanda! More ambiguous on the dusting!  Kenneth, answer the door! 
"
15,14,Cartman,"What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
"
15,14,Kenny,"(What the fuck are you doing here?!)
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"Hello Eric, your room is upstairs to the left. Are you hungry?
"
15,14,Cartman,"You're my new mom?
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"You can call me Mom if you like.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"This is where you'll sleep with your foster brothers. You will be clean, polite, and most importantly, you WILL follow the agnostic code: We cannot know for certain if God or Christ existed. They COULD. Then again there COULD be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything. Can we be CERTAIN there isn't? NO, so it's pointless to talk about. Now say it with me.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"HEY! We do not take the Lord's name in vain in this house, just in case there is one! Do you understand, or do you need the punishment room?!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! 
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"My name. Is not. Meom!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
"
15,14,Karen,"I'll see you at recess, right?
"
15,14,Kenny,"(I'll be there, Karen.) 
"
15,14,Cartman,"You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! 
"
15,14,Boy 1,"Oh hey, Kenny. Who's this?
"
15,14,Kenny,"(This is Eric Cartman.)
"
15,14,Boy 2,"Does he live with you at the foster home?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!
"
15,14,Boy 1,"What are you talking about? The poor kid at this school is Jacob Hallery. 
"
15,14,Cartman,"Really?
"
15,14,Boy 2,"Yeah, dude. His dad died five years ago and his mom went crazy from depression, so she can't even keep a job.
"
15,14,Cartman,"YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!
"
15,14,Boy 1,"Did he do stuff like this at your old school?
"
15,14,Kenny,"(Uh huh.)
"
15,14,Cartman,"Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom's so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. 
"
15,14,Principal,"Eric, at Greeley Elementary we do not tolerate students making fun of other students.
"
15,14,Cartman,"I wasn't making fun of anybody.
"
15,14,Principal,"A twenty-minute song and dance number with forty seven ""Yo momma so poor"" jokes directed at Jacob Hallery, which ended in a finale with fireworks.
"
15,14,Cartman,"I was just teasing.
"
15,14,Principal,"Your case worker has been notified, and he is not happy.
"
15,14,Cartman,"My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"I know this is a difficult adjustment for you, Eric! But you can't just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who can't defend himself! I mean, what do you think this is?! The shower room at Penn State?! I'm kidding. We like to have fun in our department, so I was like, ""Oh, look. What? Is this like the shower room at Penn State?!"" I joke around. This is my head shot. 
"
15,14,Cartman,"Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"Oh! Oh, and ""your momma"" jokes are better?! They've been around since the '50s!
"
15,14,Principal,"What the hell does this have to do with anything?!
"
15,14,Girl 1,"Principal, you've gotta send help to the playground! They're about to beat up that new kid!
"
15,14,Jessica,"Aww, look at the new kid and her wittle dolly. You gonna cry some more in class, wimp?!
"
15,14,Boy 3,"L-leave her alone.
"
15,14,Jessica,"Shut up! You foster twerps are all the same! Come on! Hand over the doll!  Who the hell is this?!
"
15,14,Mysterion,"How about you find another little girl to pick on?
"
15,14,Jessica,"Mind your business, Peter Pan! 
"
15,14,Mysterion,"Karen McCormick is off limits! Do you understand?! Make sure everybody in this school knows! 
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"And if this food comes as a gift from some divine intelligence, we understand that an intelligent being cannot blame us for questioning its existence. Nobody knows, nobody can know if any deity is watching over us. Amen.
"
15,14,Boy 4,"Except for Karen's guardian angel.
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"What?
"
15,14,Melissa,"Where did he take you after he saved you, Karen?
"
15,14,Karen,"He just took me back to my classroom. Then he disappeared like always.
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"What have he told you about making up angel stories?!
"
15,14,Girl 3,"But we SAW him. He leaped down from the sky.
"
15,14,David,"And he kicked the crap out of Jessica Pinkerton. 
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"Stop it, children! We do not speak such certainties in this house!
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"Get down to the basement, all of you! It's time for the Punishment Room! 
"
15,14,David,"AAAAAAAH!
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"Now, did you see an angel?!
"
15,14,David,"No, I - no - I didn't see an angel.
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"No, you can't be certain of that! You might've seen one!  Hit him with the Dr Pep-er again.  Are there such things as angels?!
"
15,14,David,"Maybe.
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"Good! 
"
15,14,Karen,"What do we do, Kenny?  Kenny?
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"What is the meaning of life?!
"
15,14,David,"It's impossible to knoooow!
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"That's right! 
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"Who could that be? 
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, I received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"What business is that of yours?!
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"It's my business because Child Protective Services is accountable for these kids!  Have I given you my head shot?
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"Yes, yes, we have that.
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"Okay now, are you only giving these kids Dr Pepper to drink?
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"If we want to serve agnostic beverages in this house, then by Goddish we'll do it! The children you've sent here are undisciplined and talking about the certainty of angels! 
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"Excuse me!  Let's have a look around.
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"What the? Who did this?
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"What is that? 
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"It was like a... little mystery person... flying around.
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"Almost like some kind of... agnostic angel. 
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"Oh my God.  What's going on here?
"
15,14,David,"We don't know... We can't possibly know...
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"What have I done?  I took you kids from your parents without even checking into where you were going! I put innocent children in a dangerous environment! What am I, a recruitment coach for Penn State?  It's not funny!
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"There's nothing in there but Dr Pep-er, right? There can't be. 
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"Ohhh...
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"How did that get here?!  It says it's a Pabst Blue Ribbon.
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"What is it?
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"It's like beer... but different. 
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"But how did it get here? 
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"Shut your mouth, bitch!
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"You shut your mouth, you filth-fucking asshole!
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"Fuck you, bitch!
"
15,14,Greeley Officer 1,"You have the right to remain silent. Now look at the camera and say ""I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.""
"
15,14,Mrs. Weatherhead,"I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
"
15,14,Greeley Officer 2,"Get in the car, you!
"
15,14,Mr. Weatherhead,"Wait a minute, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble?
"
15,14,Mr. Adams,"No, no, take all these kids back to their parents! We've embarrassed the system and made it something nobody wants to be a part of! It's like a Penn State homecoming party! 
"
15,14,Greeley Officer 3,"A false police report can carry up to a two-month prison term, son.
"
15,14,Cartman,"I'm not saying it.
"
15,14,Greeley Officer 3,"We can do this the easy way, or we can do it hard!
"
15,14,Cartman,"I'm not saying it!
"
15,14,Greeley Officer 3,"Then we'll add another charge for resisting!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
"
15,14,Narrator,"Three arrests in just one power-packed episode, proving once again that we are all just one Pabst Blue Ribbon away from becoming... white trash in trouble! Sponsored by Schlitz.
"
15,14,Stan,"Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
"
15,14,Kenny,"(Thanks, Stan.)
"
15,14,Kyle,"I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
"
15,14,Kenny,"(Good for me.)
"
15,14,Cartman,"There he is, there's my buddy.
"
15,14,Kyle,"How was jail, fatass?!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-
"
15,14,Kids,"Aaaah! 
"
15,14,Kenny,"(AAAAHH!) 
"
15,14,Stan,"...What the fuck?!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Aww, my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say ""No, I found ooone.""
"
