9,1,Doctor,"Hello, Mr. Garrison, I'm Dr. Biber. I'll be performing your surgery today.
"
9,1,Mr. Garrison,"God bless you, Doctor. I know you'll make me well again.
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Now, you're absolutely sure you want a vaginoplasty?
"
9,1,Mr. Garrison,"My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness.
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"All right, then let's begin.  Just relax, Mr. Garrison. I think if more people could just see a sex-change operation, they would know how perfectly natural it is. The first thing I'm going to do is slice your balls. 
"
9,1,Mr. Garrison,"Ough, ergh. Eww. 
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"With the scrotum open, I can now discard of your testicles.
"
9,1,Mr. Garrison,"So long, balls. 
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Now, I'll just continue the incision up the shaft of the penis. 
"
9,1,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, that stings.
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Now I'll just... turn your... penis inside out.
"
9,1,Mr. Garrison,"OH! Oh jeez.
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"All we need to do now is ...stuff the ...unskinned penis inside your... pelvis... And now I'll use the skin from your penis to make vaginal lips.
"
9,1,Mr. Garrison,"Do I look like a woman?
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Pretty much.
"
9,1,Stan,"Dude, don't be nervous.
"
9,1,Kyle,"How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
"
9,1,Stan,"You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.
"
9,1,Cartman,"This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.
"
9,1,Kyle,"I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! 
"
9,1,Lead Referee,"All students trying out for the All-State team to center court! 
"
9,1,Stan,"Good luck. 
"
9,1,Coach,"All right boys, now you're all here because you're the best of the best.  I know that you've all worked really hard to make it this far, so let's get out there and  SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT!  Uh, uh excuse me, Brof-Broflovski, is it?
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yeah?
"
9,1,Coach,"Can we talk to you for a minute?  You uh... You're the best player in your school, are ya?
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
"
9,1,Coach,"Yeah. Uh, look, kid, you've got great skills and a great attitude. But you're just not physically ...built for the game.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Oo whataya mean?
"
9,1,Coach,"Well, it's just that... Jew's can't play basketball.  Awright, kids, we've gotta work on that shooting! Come on!
"
9,1,Stan,"Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. 
"
9,1,Cartman,"Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.
"
9,1,Kyle,"I know. I deserve it.
"
9,1,Cartman,"Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!
"
9,1,Kyle,"You're right.  Jesus, that was fun...
"
9,1,Man,"Hey everybody, you're not gonna believe it!
"
9,1,Randy,"Believe what?
"
9,1,Man,"It's Mr. Garrison! Only it ISN'T Mr. Garrison! He- He's a woman now! 
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Hello everybody!  Can you believe it ladies? I'm one of YOU now!  Wow, just look at all these tampons! Regular, heavy flow- Oh boy, I can't wait till I get my first period! 
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Hi gals!  Oh boy, can you believe the sales they're havin' out there? Well, I'm about to pee out my vagina for the first time.  Give us a hug. Girls' Club!  Oh wow! This is great! Look at that, I'm peeing sittin' down like a dainty dignified little woman!  Sany, any of you ladies wanna go see a sad movie together?  You guys try those new wings tampons? Do those work well?
"
9,1,Stan,"Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.
"
9,1,Kyle,"But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Hello, boys! It's me, your teacher! Mrs. Garrison! 
"
9,1,Cartman,"You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"I had a sex-chamge operation. My penis is now a vagina and I'm experiencing womanhood for the first time in my life! See ya in class! 
"
9,1,Kyle,"Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?
"
9,1,Gerald,"What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older.
"
9,1,Kyle,"But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
"
9,1,Ike,"Penis!
"
9,1,Gerald,"Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God! 
"
9,1,Ike,"Vagina!
"
9,1,Gerald,"That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL! 
"
9,1,Sheila,"Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.
"
9,1,Gerald,"He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!
"
9,1,Sheila,"It's very simple.  You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yeah. That's right.
"
9,1,Sheila,"They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand?
"
9,1,Kyle,"Totally! I totally understand!
"
9,1,Sheila,"There. You see, Gerald? He totally understands.
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive surgery.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had a vaginoplasty. Mhm.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants to be a man. That procedure is called a peniplasty.
"
9,1,Kyle,"No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"...You what?
"
9,1,Kyle,"I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Ohhhhh! You want a negroplasty!
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yeah! 
"
9,1,Stan,"Wha-a-a negroplasty??
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"It's a fairly common procedure, really, just the reverse of a caucasioplasty just like Michael Jackson had. Let's take a look here.  What we do is slice your face and peel it back so we can insert now pigment producing cells inside.  We break the arm bones in several places and put braces to make them longer.  Now, the knees we need to snap off and fill with small round objects that can cause better movement.  And we finish it off with a nice peniplasty to enhance the genitalia.  Negroplasty takes about seven hours and costs roughly three thousand dollars.
"
9,1,Stan,"Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Well, it's a good idea if you wanna be tall and black. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Hello, Mr. Slave.  Boy have I been busy. A woman's work is never done.  I got some tampons. I should be getting my period really soon. I hope I don't get too emotional and drive you crazy with my PMS.  Mr. Slave, I got&#160;!Mrs.somethin' for us, too.  Would you like to take this beautiful woman to bed?
"
9,1,Mr. Slave,"No thanks.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Nu- no thanks? Come on, Mr. Slave, I wanna try out my new snootch.
"
9,1,Mr. Slave,"I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Well, I ASSUMED you supported me. It's still me; I just have a vagina instead of a penis.
"
9,1,Mr. Slave,"But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas!
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Don't you even care that I was suffering? I wasn't happy the way I was!
"
9,1,Mr. Slave,"It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel!
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Look, we can still be together. All you have to do is stop being gay!
"
9,1,Mr. Slave,"How can you say that?! You're gay too!
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"I'm not gay! I'm a woman!
"
9,1,Mr. Slave,"Oh, Jesus Christ! 
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Oh, so is that it?!  You're just gonna walk out?! You men are all alike! Go ahead and find somebody who doesn't have a vagina, you fag! 
"
9,1,Kyle,"Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
"
9,1,Sheila,"What??
"
9,1,Kyle,"Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. 
"
9,1,Gerald,"Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!
"
9,1,Kyle,"Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??
"
9,1,Sheila,"Absolutely not, Kyle!
"
9,1,Kyle,"But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
"
9,1,Sheila,"Yes, but Kyle-
"
9,1,Kyle,"Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.
"
9,1,Sheila,"Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
"
9,1,Sheila,"The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!
"
9,1,Kyle,"But Jews can't play basketball! 
"
9,1,Gerald,"Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!
"
9,1,Kyle,"I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 
"
9,1,Gerald,"Oh, that does it!
"
9,1,Sheila,"Where are you going?!
"
9,1,Gerald,"That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off! 
"
9,1,Gerald,"Who the hell do you think you are?!
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Dr. Biber.
"
9,1,Gerald,"What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Oh, you're Kyle's father.
"
9,1,Gerald,"Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"What is that on your shirt?
"
9,1,Gerald,"What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins! Why?
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Ahhh you like dolphins, hm? 
"
9,1,Gerald,"A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"I can make you one.
"
9,1,Gerald,"...What?
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Invert the back, move the esophagus to the top of the head. Yes, a full dolphinoplasty could be achieved relatively simply...
"
9,1,Gerald,"Make me a... dolphin? 
"
9,1,Singer,"If I could swim with the dolphins, the soft and gentle dolphins...Why can't I swim with the dolphins?
"
9,1,Gerald,"...No.  No, no, it's crazy.
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"There's nothing crazy about a person wanting to look on the outside the way they feel on ths inside.
"
9,1,Announcer,"It's Girls Gone Wild!  These girls will do anything! 
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Oh jeez, should I do it?! Should I do it?! Oh what the hell!  Wooo! Huhuh, wooo!
"
9,1,Men,"Awww!
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Look, I'll giggle and make them bounce up and down!  Heeheeheeheehee, heeheeheeheeheeheehee.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Oh boy, men will do just about anything to get a look at our tits, won't they? Men are all the same. My boyfriend walked out on me! Turns out he was a fag. But I've been livin' it up ever since, havin' sex with all kinds of different guys! Girl power!  You know, the strange thing is, I haven't gotten my period yet. Is there a reason a woman might miss her period?
"
9,1,Redhead,"Well, normally, if a woman misses her period, it means she's pregnant.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"...Pregnant?  Oh my God. Of course.  I haven't gotten to experience a period because... one of those truckers I slept with got me knocked up.  I'm pregnant, everybody! Hoh boy, now I can have an abortion! 
"
9,1,Sheila,"Gerald! What happened to you?!
"
9,1,Gerald,"That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.  Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin! 
"
9,1,Sheila,"A dolphin?!?!
"
9,1,Gerald,"Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself? 
"
9,1,Sheila,"Gerald, this is crazy!
"
9,1,Gerald,"I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...  here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding! 
"
9,1,Butters,"Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!
"
9,1,Stan,"What?
"
9,1,Butters,"Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro! 
"
9,1,Jason,"Wow.
"
9,1,Craig,"Can't believe it.
"
9,1,Clyde,"Did it hurt?
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yeah, but it was totally worth it. 
"
9,1,Stan,"Jesus Christ, dude!
"
9,1,Kyle,"Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
"
9,1,Gerald,"Come on, Kyle, we should get going!
"
9,1,Kyle,"Alright, Dad! 
"
9,1,Stan,"Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?
"
9,1,Cartman,"He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"You here for an abortion too?  Yeah, I discovered a few days ago I wasn't bleedin' out my coo, so I guess I'm knocked up. Is this doctor any good?
"
9,1,Nurse,"Mrs... Garrison?
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Oh, that's me. 
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Hello doctor, looks like I need an abortion. 
"
9,1,Doctor,"...an abortion?
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Yeah, I've got one growing inside me. Now, are you gonna scramble its brains or just vacuum it out?  ...If you want you can just scramble it and I'll queef it out myself.
"
9,1,Doctor,"Mmister Garrison-
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Mrs. Garrison.
"
9,1,Doctor,"Mmrs. Garrison, you can't have an abortion.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Don't you tell me what I can and can't do with my body!  A woman has a right to choose!
"
9,1,Doctor,"No, I mean you're physically unable to have an abortion, because you can't get pregnant.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"But I missed my period.
"
9,1,Doctor,"You can't have periods either.  You had a sex change, Mr. Garrison, but you don't have ovaries or a womb. You don't produce eggs.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"You mean, I'll never know what it feels like to have a baby growing inside me and then scramble its brains and vacuum it out?
"
9,1,Doctor,"N-that's right.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"But I paid five thousand dollars to be a woman. This would mean I I'm not really a woman. Ih, I'm just a... a I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis!
"
9,1,Doctor,"Basically, yes.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"...Oh boy, do I feel like a jackass.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Hey asshole!
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Excuse me, I'm performing an operation here!
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"You told me you were going to make me into a woman!
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"I gave you a sex change.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Yeah?! Well what kind of woman can't have abortions and bleed out her snatch once a month?! You made me into a FREAK is what you did! And I want you to change me back!
"
9,1,Patient,"Am I a man yet?
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Mr. Garrison, I can't reattach your organs.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Why the hell not?!
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Because I've already used your testicles to fashion new knees for a little boy who wanted to be tall and black.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"You WHAT?!
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"And your scrotum has been made into a dorsal fin for a man who wanted to look more like a dolphin.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Oh you! You're comin' with me right now to find my ball and scrotum right now, Mr. Man! 
"
9,1,Announcer,"Welcome to the All-State Basketball Playoffs between the best fourth-grade players from Colorado and the best fourth-grade players from Wyoming. 
"
9,1,Kyle,"Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.
"
9,1,Coach,"Who are you?
"
9,1,Kyle,"Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
"
9,1,Coach,"Well, you're tall and black enough. All right, Broflovski, suit up!
"
9,1,Kyle,"All right!  Dad, I can play! 
"
9,1,Gerald,"Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Boys, have you seen Kyle?! He's not at home.
"
9,1,Stan,"Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"He's going to play basketball? Oh my God.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"What?
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Well, ah I only made him look like he could play basketball. If he actually does it, the testicle in his knees will explode! 
"
9,1,Stan,"What?! But you made him into a basketball player.
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"No, I just made him look more like one. We have to stop him from playing! Those testicles in his knees are ticking time balls!
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Oh Jesus! We've gotta get to my balls before Kyle hurts himself! 
"
9,1,Singer,"...and the home of the... brave! 
"
9,1,Coach,"Broflovski, be ready to take over for Owens.
"
9,1,Kyle,"I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! 
"
9,1,Gerald,"Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?
"
9,1,Usher,"We don't... have one.
"
9,1,Gerald,"Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.
"
9,1,Usher,"Ahhh- Too bad?
"
9,1,Gerald,"Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!
"
9,1,Usher,"You're a lawphin?
"
9,1,Usher,"Tickets please.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"We don't have tickets!
"
9,1,Security Guard,"Sorry ma'am, no tickets, no entry.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Look, there's a boy with my balls in his knees and he's in serious danger!
"
9,1,Usher,"What?
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"My scrotum!  That dolphin has my scrotum! Now let us in!
"
9,1,Security Guard,"You can't go in, ma'am!  We have unauthorized entry on level one!
"
9,1,Coach,"All right. Broflovski, you're going in next possession.
"
9,1,Kyle,"All right!  Ow. Hm. 
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Gerald, where's Kyle?!
"
9,1,Gerald,"What? Why??
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"My balls are in his knees. If he jumps with them they'll explode!
"
9,1,Gerald,"Oh my God! 
"
9,1,Security Guard,"There they are, next to that dolphin!
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Come on, we've gotta get to those balls! 
"
9,1,Security Guard,"Stop them! They didn't pay the two-dollar entry fee!
"
9,1,Announcer,"Now substituting for Colorado, number 8, Kyle Broflovski. 
"
9,1,Stan,"Oh Jesus, he's about to play! 
"
9,1,Gerald,"Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle!
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"Which one is he?? 
"
9,1,Wyoming Coach,"Hey, what the hell?!
"
9,1,Gerald,"Stop the game! 
"
9,1,Kyle,"I got it! I got the ball. 
"
9,1,Stan,"Kyle, NO! 
"
9,1,Announcer,"Broflovski goes for the dunk!
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"NO!  My baaaallllssss. 
"
9,1,Officer,"So let me get this straight. That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin.
"
9,1,Stan,"Yeah, that's basically it.
"
9,1,Officer,"Sounds like an open and shut case. All right, let's head 'em out! 
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"I'm sorry, Kyle, I should have told you the surgery was cosmetic only.
"
9,1,Gerald,"So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?
"
9,1,Dr. Biber,"Let's get you two up to the clinic and I'll change you back, for a nominal fee.
"
9,1,Kyle,"But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
"
9,1,Mrs. Garrison,"You know what? I'm okay. Even though I'm not truly a woman, I think I still like the new me. I'd rather be a woman who can't have periods than a fag.  Hey guys! This girl is staying a woman! Who wants to pound my vadge! Girl power!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.
"
9,2,Elderly Woman,"Hippies?
"
9,2,Cartman,"Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?
"
9,2,Cartman,"Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  See that? Hippies. 
"
9,2,Elderly Woman,"Oh my.
"
9,2,Cartman,"These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. 
"
9,2,Elderly Woman,"Oh, well they showed up a few days ago, but I didn't think they were hurting anything.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.
"
9,2,Elderly Woman,"Oh dear.
"
9,2,Elderly Woman,"Oh, well, so, so what do I do?
"
9,2,Cartman,"Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit! 
"
9,2,Hippie 1,"Whoa, how did I get here? Man, I'm so high.
"
9,2,Cartman,"God damn hippie! 
"
9,2,Hippie 1,"Whoa, dude!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Get out of here!
"
9,2,Hippie 1,"Not cool!  What's up?! 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!
"
9,2,Elderly Woman,"Ooooo...what's that?
"
9,2,Cartman,"The college know-it-all hippies.
"
9,2,Driver,"Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place.
"
9,2,Woman 1,"Yeah, this will be a great place to spend spring break. 
"
9,2,Kyle,"Hey, let's ask them. 
"
9,2,Stan,"All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?
"
9,2,Driver,"Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world?
"
9,2,Kyle,"Wha- whataya mean?
"
9,2,Man 1,"You're playing into the corporate game! See, the corporations are trying to turn you into little Eichmann's so that they can make money. 
"
9,2,Stan,"Who are the corporations?
"
9,2,Woman 2,"The corporations run the entire world. And now they fooled you into working for them.
"
9,2,Stan,"Are you serious? We never heard that.
"
9,2,Driver,"We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.
"
9,2,Kyle,"Ugh! Those dirty liars!
"
9,2,Kenny,"(Sonofabitch!) 
"
9,2,Man 2,"This is a really nice town you have here. That's why the corporations are trying to use you to take it down.
"
9,2,Stan,"Well... Well what do we do?
"
9,2,Driver,"Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told. 
"
9,2,Hippie 2,"It is time to let us out! I'm sending your names! Open this door right now!
"
9,2,Cartman,"All right, in you go.
"
9,2,Hippie 2,"What are you doing, man?!
"
9,2,Hippie 3,"Let us out! 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! 
"
9,2,Hippie 2,"What's up, man?! You can't keep us down here like this!
"
9,2,Hippie 4,"What's wrong with you?!
"
9,2,Cartman,"What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!
"
9,2,Hippie 5,"What makes you think you could tell us where to live?!
"
9,2,Hippie 6,"This is a free country, man!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.
"
9,2,Hippie 3,"Just go with it? We've been down here for days!
"
9,2,Cartman,"And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar! 
"
9,2,Singer,"What's goin' on in this world o'mine?There's a whole lot of killin' in this world o'mine. Somebody's gotta help this world o'mine...
"
9,2,Stan,"Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind.
"
9,2,Sharon,"Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come?
"
9,2,Stan,"Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.
"
9,2,Sharon,"Okay, sweetie.
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B.
"
9,2,Chef,"Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!
"
9,2,Linda Stotch,"We don't have it in the budget to fix them right now.
"
9,2,Gerald,"We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.
"
9,2,Chef,"We- 
"
9,2,Guard,"You can't go in there!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Please, I have to talk to you all right now!
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Kid, we're have a city council meeting.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!
"
9,2,Randy,"What are you talking about?
"
9,2,Cartman,"I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.
"
9,2,Linda,"A what?
"
9,2,Cartman,"It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. 
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Kid, what the hell are you talking about?
"
9,2,Cartman,"I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!
"
9,2,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay.
"
9,2,Cartman,"It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Johnson, get him out of here. 
"
9,2,Cartman,"What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger! 
"
9,2,Driver,"You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind.
"
9,2,Stan,"Right, so how do we get back at them?
"
9,2,Kyle,"Yeah, we're pissed off.
"
9,2,Driver,"Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the hell?! 
"
9,2,Cartman,"I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!
"
9,2,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!
"
9,2,Stan,"NO!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. 
"
9,2,Man 1,"What is your problem? Get lost, little Eichmann. 
"
9,2,Woman 2,"Oh my God!
"
9,2,Man 2,"What the hell are you doing?! 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Everybody get in a single-file line!
"
9,2,Officer Barbrady,"There you are!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.
"
9,2,Officer Barbrady,"Eric Cartman, you are under arrest.
"
9,2,Cartman,"What?
"
9,2,Officer Barbrady,"I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.
"
9,2,Cartman,"You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!
"
9,2,Officer Barbrady,"Oh no, you're coming downtown! 
"
9,2,Cartman,"No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! 
"
9,2,Driver,"Who was that?
"
9,2,Cartman,"What did I do?!
"
9,2,Officer Barbrady,"You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.
"
9,2,Cartman,"They're not people, they're HIPPIES!
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels.,"Is this problem under control?
"
9,2,Officer Barbrady,"I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"I know. I signed the permit.
"
9,2,Cartman,"You... You what?
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little ""festival"" should pump some money into our economy.
"
9,2,Cartman,"They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want!
"
9,2,Cartman,"You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! 
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"That kid really needs some psychiatric help.
"
9,2,Officer Barbrady,"Yeah.
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, let's go.
"
9,2,Cartman,"How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!
"
9,2,Announcer,"This is a South Park News special report! 
"
9,2,Anchorman,"Thousands of people have descended on South Park for a hippie music jam festival. The event is said to be the largest such gathering in the history of man. 
"
9,2,MC,"All right, welcome to Hippie Jam Fest 2005!  Sooo great to see sooo many people turn out to make an impact on on the world! 
"
9,2,Stan,"Yeah!
"
9,2,Kyle,"You said it!
"
9,2,MC,"For too long, the corporations have bled the world of its love and resources! It is time for us to get to work and make the world a better place! And we're gonna start right now. 
"
9,2,Man 1,"Oh man, I can't wait to see the look on those little Eichmann's faces when they hear this crunchy groove. 
"
9,2,Randy,"Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?
"
9,2,Sharon,"He went with his friends to that music festival.
"
9,2,Randy,"Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!
"
9,2,Sharon,"Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s.
"
9,2,Randy,"Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.
"
9,2,Sharon,"You ate too much acid, man! 
"
9,2,Sharon,"...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.
"
9,2,Randy,"S-stan. STAAAN!
"
9,2,Announcer,"This is South Park News!
"
9,2,Anchorman,"Fear and horror in South Park today as the music festival continues to grow.  They're arriving in droves and apparently no end is in sight.
"
9,2,Reporter,"Tom, the crowd just keeps getting bigger and the town is literally bursting at the seams. We don't know where this music festival came from, but, it's very close to consuming us all.
"
9,2,Linda,"Steven, what do we do?
"
9,2,Randy,"Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! 
"
9,2,Jimbo,"Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!
"
9,2,Randy,"My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!
"
9,2,Male hippie,"Hey, chill man. It's all good.
"
9,2,Female hippie,"Have some water laced with acid.
"
9,2,Randy,"Sta-ogh. Ugh! 
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"What have I done?
"
9,2,MC,"Yeah, South Park is now the hippie capital of the world! 
"
9,2,Mr. Mackey,"Uh huh hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'?
"
9,2,Cartman,"Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.
"
9,2,Randy,"Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?
"
9,2,Cartman,"Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
"
9,2,Sheila,"We we need to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Forget it. 
"
9,2,Randy,"Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.
"
9,2,Chef,"Yeah. We apologize.
"
9,2,Jimbo,"Please. Don't let them ruin our town.
"
9,2,Cartman,"It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!
"
9,2,Mr. Mackey,"We know you can do it, Eric. You're smart. Wha- why you're the smartest kid in school, m'kay?
"
9,2,Randy,"We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
"
9,2,Randy,"It's yours.
"
9,2,Cartman,"I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.
"
9,2,Principal Victoria,"Fine.
"
9,2,Jimbo,"Anything else?
"
9,2,Cartman,"Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!
"
9,2,Sheila,"Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th-  Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you.
"
9,2,Cartman,"All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! 
"
9,2,Driver,"Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed.
"
9,2,Stan,"So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
"
9,2,Man 1,"Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money!
"
9,2,Kyle,"Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.
"
9,2,Man 2,"Right now we're proving we don't need corporations. We don't need money. This can become a commune where everyone just helps each other.
"
9,2,Man 1,"Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety.
"
9,2,Stan,"You mean like a baker and a cop?
"
9,2,Man 2,"No no, can't you imagine a place where people live together and like, provide services for each other in exchange for their services?
"
9,2,Kyle,"Yeah, it's called a town.
"
9,2,Driver,"You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE.
"
9,2,Cartman,"All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.
"
9,2,Randy,"My God...
"
9,2,Cartman,"In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.
"
9,2,Jimbo,"Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?
"
9,2,Cartman,"We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.
"
9,2,Steven,"Yuh... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob? It's a suicide mission!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.
"
9,2,Randy,"I'm the... only scientist in town.
"
9,2,Linda,"I'm your engineer.
"
9,2,Steven,"Honey, no!
"
9,2,Linda,"I have to do it, Steven.
"
9,2,Cartman,"All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I know. How about- 
"
9,2,Chef,"Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine!
"
9,2,Steven,"I I can't believe we're actually listening to this. This is a crazy plan!
"
9,2,Randy,"You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!
"
9,2,Cartman,"There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got.
"
9,2,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where a desperate attempt to save the town is underway. Some call it a suicide mission, but the heroic men and women of the hippie digger may be our only hope of survival. 
"
9,2,Ramdu,"Well I... guess this is it, Sharon.
"
9,2,Sharon,"Please, save our boy, Randy.
"
9,2,Linda,"Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy.
"
9,2,Butters,"Ah I will, Mom.
"
9,2,Chef,"Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine.
"
9,2,Cartman,"I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. 
"
9,2,Sheila,"Look out for yourselves!
"
9,2,Mrs. Garrison,"Godspeed! 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Primary engine running?
"
9,2,Randy,"Check.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Navigation systems?
"
9,2,Linda,"Online
"
9,2,Cartman,"Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?
"
9,2,Randy,"Vehicle shell holding! 
"
9,2,Jimbo,"They're in!
"
9,2,Townsfolk,"All right! All right, yeah! We did it!
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people, let's save it!  They still have a long way to go!
"
9,2,Stan,"Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!
"
9,2,Kyle,"You're doing what?
"
9,2,Guard,"Hey, you can't go up there. Hoohoo, woo! 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that?
"
9,2,Randy,"The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. 
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"What's happened?
"
9,2,Mr. Mackey,"They, they s- they stopped. Something's wrong.
"
9,2,Steven,"Jesus... they're dead in the water.  '
"
9,2,Stan,"Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?
"
9,2,A hippie,"We're using the power of rock and roll to change the world! Woo! 
"
9,2,Stan,"Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?
"
9,2,Singer,"He's right. It's time for all of us to focus our energy and get this hippie jam into full swing. 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Come on, come on!
"
9,2,Linda,"It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.
"
9,2,Randy,"Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
"
9,2,Cartman,"No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!
"
9,2,Chef,"...I didn't volunteer!
"
9,2,Cartman,"...All right, fine Chef, go!
"
9,2,Chef,"...Aw dammit! 
"
9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!
"
9,2,Steven,"God dammit no! Y-you have to give them more time!
"
9,2,Stan,"Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.
"
9,2,Kyle,"We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
"
9,2,Stan,"What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? 
"
9,2,Man 2,"Hey, what happened to the tunes, man?
"
9,2,Man 1,"More tunes. More tunes! 
"
9,2,Linda,"We made it, We made it!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! 
"
9,2,Randy,"Which cord is it?
"
9,2,Cartman,"You're the scientist, jackass!
"
9,2,Randy,"I'm a geologist!
"
9,2,Linda,"We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!
"
9,2,Randy,"Nyugh!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Put them in my laptop! 
"
9,2,A hippie,"Oh man, not cool.
"
9,2,Hippie 3,"This music is so angry.
"
9,2,Man 2,"This is killing my buzz.
"
9,2,Man 1,"Let's bail on this whole angry scene. 
"
9,2,Randy,"It's working!
"
9,2,Linda,"What?
"
9,2,Randy,"It's, it's working!
"
9,2,Mrs. Garrison,"We did it! We did it! 
"
9,2,Stan,"Dad!
"
9,2,Randy,"Stan! 
"
9,2,Chef,"I'm alive! 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Hold it right there, Kyle! 
"
9,2,Kyle,"Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!
"
9,3,Mrs. Garrison,"Children, children, we have a very special announcement.  Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing! Well let's give him a hand! 
"
9,3,Stan,"Token sings?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Of course he sings. He's black.
"
9,3,Mrs. Garrison,"Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna be paid two hundred dollars.
"
9,3,Class,"Whoa!
"
9,3,Stan,"Two hundred dollars.
"
9,3,Mrs. Garrison,"Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special.
"
9,3,Stan,"Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?
"
9,3,Kyle,"How come we never get opportunities like that?
"
9,3,Cartman,"You wanna know what it is, guys?
"
9,3,Kyle,"We're not talented?
"
9,3,Cartman,"That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
"
9,3,Stan,"Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Probably.
"
9,3,Cartman,"So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
"
9,3,Stan,"Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
"
9,3,Cartman,"We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. 
"
9,3,Stan,"He's looking at the sign.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
"
9,3,Stan,"All right.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Why?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
"
9,3,Stan,"It's genius.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!
"
9,3,Token,"Nothin'
"
9,3,Cartman,"Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
"
9,3,Token,"Yeah.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
"
9,3,Token,"I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
"
9,3,Cartman,"This will only take a second.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token.  Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.
"
9,3,Stan,"Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right?
"
9,3,Token,"...Yeah?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Can I talk to you?! 
"
9,3,Cartman,"I'll I'll call you back, Abe. 
"
9,3,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
9,3,Cartman,"I'm making it look like important people call us.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
"
9,3,Cartman,"...well Token doesn't know that.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Yes he does!
"
9,3,Cartman,"How?!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Jew! 
"
9,3,Stan,"You guys, we're gonna lose our client. 
"
9,3,Cartman,"Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?
"
9,3,Token,"We were at why I should give you ten percent.
"
9,3,Stan,"Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
"
9,3,Stan,"This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie.
"
9,3,Token,"Well, I guess that makes sense. All right. 
"
9,3,Cartman,"Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Welcome to the team, Token.
"
9,3,Stan,"Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!
"
9,3,Kenny,"(Hey, terrific!)
"
9,3,Cartman,"From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.
"
9,3,MC,"And there are your finalists, the sixteen most beautiful women in Colorado. Here to sing for our sixteen lucky finalists, the winner of the Colorado Child Star Contest, Token Black. 
"
9,3,Token,"You'll never find...As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do...
"
9,3,Man,"Wow, he's really great. We should get him to sing at Tommy's bar mitzvah 
"
9,3,Stan,"Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?
"
9,3,Cartman,"We represent Token.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.
"
9,3,Token,"Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, babyBut I'm the one who loves youAnd there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else.
"
9,3,Mrs. Garrison,"Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing.
"
9,3,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Garrison, for the love of God.
"
9,3,Token,"... (you're gonna miss my lovin')I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove.
"
9,3,Stan,"You were awesome, Token!
"
9,3,Kyle,"We knew you could do it!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is...
"
9,3,Kyle,"Twenty dollars.
"
9,3,Token,"Here you go. 
"
9,3,Kenny,"(All right!)
"
9,3,Cartman,"Sweet!
"
9,3,Stan,"This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
"
9,3,Agent,"Hey there my man, that was a great performance.
"
9,3,Token,"Thanks.
"
9,3,Agent,"Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in Los Angeles. I think you've got real promise. How'd you like to sign with CAA?
"
9,3,Token,"Are you serious?
"
9,3,Stan,"Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.
"
9,3,Cartman,"You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
"
9,3,Don,"Mm, no. Uh, look, Token, there's some shows in LA we wanna book you on right away. If you come out to my limo we can talk everything through.
"
9,3,Token,"Oh my God! Okay!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Token, you signed with us!
"
9,3,Token,"Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.
"
9,3,Cartman,"What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
"
9,3,Don,"Actually, our fountain is two stories tall.
"
9,3,Cartman,"...Oooo...
"
9,3,Don,"Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Mister, you can't do this to us!
"
9,3,Don,"Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know?  Do you like steak, Token? I know a great place for you locally. 
"
9,3,Cartman,"...Goddamnit! 
"
9,3,Stan,"So unfair... so unfair.
"
9,3,Kyle,"All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
"
9,3,Cartman,"This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! 
"
9,3,Mr. Kim,"Ahh hello, is this the Talent Agency
"
9,3,Stan,"Huh?
"
9,3,Mr. Kim,"I see this sign on the street for a talent agency? I need a representation.  Hey, wowee, nice fountain.

9,3,Mr. Kim,"No, not me, my wife.  This is Wing. She just come over from China.  She over here uh irregarry. The Chinese Mafia help me out.
"
9,3,Stan,"And what does she do?
"
9,3,Mr. Kim,"Ah, she sing. She very popular in China. Hey, you just sit and listen. You'll be very impressed.  Well? What you think?
"
9,3,Stan,"Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.
"
9,3,Mr. Kim,"Aww, that's too bad. She just got accepted to be on American Idol in Ros Angeres, but I can't take her 'cause I have to mind the restaurant. 
"
9,3,Cartman,"You've ...already done all the work?
"
9,3,Mr. Kim,"Yes. They say it pays a thousand dowar.

"
9,3,Stan,"There it is! American Idol contestants!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Jesus, we made it just in time! 
"
9,3,Cartman,"Excuse us!
"
9,3,Contestant,"Hey kid, what do you think you're doing? 
"
9,3,Stan,"Ah our client has an audition to this show.
"
9,3,Contestant,"Yeah. So do we! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Oh crap!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Dude, how long is the wait?
"
9,3,Contestant 2,"It's been about seventeen days for me.
"
9,3,Stan,"Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am.
"
9,3,Attendant,"Wait in line with everyone else. 
"
9,3,Stan,"No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
"
9,3,Cartman,"Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Aw, just forget it! 
"
9,3,Cartman,"Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
"
9,3,Stan,"We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Stupid assholes! 
"
9,3,Agent,"What do you mean your client isn't coming?! We're taping the show tomorrow! Where am I goin' to find another contestant? Fine! Go screw yourself!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
"
9,3,Stan,"We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
"
9,3,Agent,"Really?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
"
9,3,Agent,"Well yeah, winner gets a thousand dollars.
"
9,3,Stan,"All right, our client will do it!
"
9,3,Agent,"Great! You kids just saved my ass! See you over at Stage 6. 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
"
9,3,Agent,"Naw, this is better. It's called The Contender. 
"
9,3,Stan,"What's ""The Contender""?
"
9,3,Announcer,"Tonight, two people will compete for glory. One will stay, one will go home, in the new hit show by Sylvester Stallone.
"
9,3,Stallone,"Hello.
"
9,3,Announcer,"The Contender!
"
9,3,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Contender! Fighting out of the red corner, wearing blue and white trunks, the Destructor from Del Fuego, Mexico, Manuelo Furrrrnanda! 
"
9,3,Stallone,"Le's go! Le's see a good fight!
"
9,3,Announcer,"And fighting out of the blue corner, wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk dress, Wing!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Come on, Wing!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Let's do it Wing!
"
9,3,Stan,"Go Wing! 
"
9,3,Stallone,"Aw yeah! 
"
9,3,The Boys,"Awww! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Oh my God, dude!
"
9,3,Cartman,"She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. 
"
9,3,The Boys,"Awww! 
"
9,3,Cartman,"Gay.
"
9,3,Stan,"Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Your gift of hope is a great deduction. 
"
9,3,Stallone,"Hey kid! 
"
9,3,Producer,"Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
"
9,3,Stan,"Oh, thanks.
"
9,3,Stallone,"Yo kid. 
"
9,3,Producer,"Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.  He really likes her voice.  You know, the way she vocalizes the melody,  it brings tears to his eyes.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. 
"
9,3,Producer,"Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.
"
9,3,Stan,"You do? 
"
9,3,Producer,"He'll pay her four thousand dollars.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Four thousand dollars? 
"
9,3,Producer,"Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp. And don't be late.
"
9,3,Stan,"We won't! 
"
9,3,"Stan, Cartman","Waaaaah! 
"
9,3,Stan,"You guys, you guys!
"
9,3,Kyle,"What?
"
9,3,Stan,"Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
"
9,3,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
9,3,Kyle,"Get out!
"
9,3,Cartman,"That's four hundred for us! We did it! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Woohoo! Yeah!
"
9,3,Stan,"Yeah!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Who let the dogs out?
"
9,3,The Boys,"Who? Who? Who who?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Who let the dogs out?
"
9,3,The Boys,"Who? Who? Who who?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Who let-?
"
9,3,Stan,"Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing? 
"
9,3,Kyle,"What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Naw, sh-she was with you!
"
9,3,Stan,"...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Wing? Wing?
"
9,3,Kyle,"Wing?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Wing? Here, Wing!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Wing?
"
9,3,Kenny,"(Wing?) 
"
9,3,Tong Leader,"You thought you could run from us, did you? 
"
9,3,Stan,"Oh no!  Hey! That's our client! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
"
9,3,Tong Leader,"You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away. Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves. It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us. 
"
9,3,Stan,"Two four nine all right, this is the place.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!
"
9,3,Guard 1,"""It's just four little boys"" 
"
9,3,Cartman,"Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.
"
9,3,Stan,"Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. 
"
9,3,Kyle,"You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
"
9,3,Stan,"You tell 'em, Kyle!
"
9,3,Kyle,"You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 
"
9,3,Stan,"Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
"
9,3,Tong Leader,"What the hell is that?! Go! Go! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Dude, maybe we should give up!
"
9,3,Stan,"No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Cartman! 
"
9,3,Cartman,"Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this! 
"
9,3,Stan,"We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Wing?
"
9,3,Kyle,"Stupid talent agents!
"
9,3,Kyle,"All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!
"
9,3,Kyle,"They killed Kenny!
"
9,3,Stan,"You bastards!
"
9,3,Tong Leader,"Enough!  I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here. But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!
"
9,3,Stan,"Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!
"
9,3,Tong Leader,"This woman has a contract with us! We own her!
"
9,3,Kyle,"She had a contract with us first! We own her!
"
9,3,Tong Leader,"Her life belongs to us!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Her life belongs to us!
"
9,3,Stan,"Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
9,3,Stan,"Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
"
9,3,Tong Leader,"Perhaps... you're right. We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.
"
9,3,Tong Leader,"I am tired of this business. It is a very dirty and perverse business.
"
9,3,Stan,"It's a lousy business. I quit.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Me too.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Aw aw guys, come on!
"
9,3,Tong Leader,"We quit too.  It's time for us to find another way to make money. From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void.
"
9,3,"Stan, Kyle","All right!
"
9,3,Producer,"Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding. And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing! 
"
9,3,Wing,"Sing, sing a song, make it simple, to last your whole life long...
"
9,3,Mr. Kim,"Boys, thank you so much for eveything. You rearry helped us out.
"
9,3,Tong Leader,"Yes, you were right, kids. Her voice is so beautiful.  To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing. 
"
9,3,Stan,"I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. 
"
9,3,Token,"Send a cress in your plates, folks? 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Token?
"
9,3,Token,"Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Token, you're... waiting tables?
"
9,3,Token,"Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! 
"
9,3,Tong Leader,"My God, her voice is sooo beautiful! 
"
9,3,Mr. Kim,"Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower. 
"
9,3,Wing,"Sing, sing a song.
"
9,4,Cartman,"Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!
"
9,4,Liane,"Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early.
"
9,4,Cartman,"Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one!  Come on! 
"
9,4,Liane,"Sweetie, can't we go after school?
"
9,4,Cartman,"Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!
"
9,4,Cartman,"I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!
"
9,4,Cartman,"Kenny, when did you get here?
"
9,4,Kenny,"(Friday)
"
9,4,Cartman,"Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. 
"
9,4,Tall Goth,"Hey dickhole! What do you think you're doing?
"
9,4,Cartman,"Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.
"
9,4,Sixth Grader,"There's no saving place, fourthie! Get to the back or we'll beat your face in!
"
9,4,Cartman,"Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out!
"
9,4,Kyle,"That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
"
9,4,Stan,"It's a game called ""Heaven versus Hell."" Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?
"
9,4,Cartman,"YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!
"
9,4,Kyle,"Wuh what'd I do?
"
9,4,Cartman,"JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!
"
9,4,Game Voice,"""Congratulations! You have reached ...level nine!""
"
9,4,Kyle,"Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell.""
"
9,4,Stan,"Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.
"
9,4,Mrs. McCormick,"Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else!
"
9,4,Kenny,"(I could get to level sixty!)
"
9,4,Mrs. McCormick,"Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, just like your dead-beat father!
"
9,4,Stuart,"Hey, I heard that, bitch!
"
9,4,Mrs. McCormick,"I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!! 
"
9,4,Stuart,"How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!
"
9,4,Mrs. McCormick,"I'd like to see you try!
"
9,4,Stuart,"Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!
"
9,4,Mrs. McCormick,"It's my house too, you no-good loser!
"
9,4,Game Voice,"You have reached level sixty!
"
9,4,Kenny,"(Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!) 
"
9,4,Driver,"Oh yeah, level four, sweet!
"
9,4,Kenny,"(Hey, that's odd.)  (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!) 
"
9,4,Angel 1,"Open the gate!
"
9,4,Angel 2,"Open the gate! 
"
9,4,Peter,"Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven, Kenny. I am Peter.
"
9,4,Kenny,"(What the fuck is going on?)
"
9,4,Peter,"There isn't much time, Kenny. You're dead, but, your death was no accident. Heaven needs you.
"
9,4,Kenny,"(Me?)
"
9,4,Peter,"Come! There is much to discuss.  Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan is planning a massive attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him! God has changed the rules here. For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven.  But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command.
"
9,4,Kenny,"(That I what?)
"
9,4,Peter,"The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe.
"
9,4,Angel 3,"Satan's army grows as we speak. The Dark Lord knows that our armies are few in number, and unorganized. So our only hope... is perfect strategy. 
"
9,4,Angel 4,"A child? This is God's solution?
"
9,4,Peter,"He beat Satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations.
"
9,4,Angel 4,"Archangel Michael, what say you?
"
9,4,Michael,"The child did something none of us could: Reach level sixty on the PSP. Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverance, but it's Goddamned impressive. All right, Kenny, let me show you what we're up against.  This is the Kingdom of Heaven. Satan's armies will attack the gate ...here. They are... ten billion in number. Maybe more.  Our armies are here, here, and here. Just under... ten thousand strong.  We are outnumbered and in need of someone who can single handedly bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically, Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves. 
"
9,4,Satan,"My fellow damned souls! Now is the time for our assault!  You know no fear! You will drink the blood of angels! We go now! Nothing can stop us!
"
9,4,Angel 5,"Step aside! Step aside, I say!  Satan! God has mocked thee once again!
"
9,4,Satan,"My spy!
"
9,4,Angel 5,"God has found a way to defeat your army.
"
9,4,Satan,"Impossible! How?!
"
9,4,Angel 5,"A young man. Basically, he-he's like Keanu Reeves.
"
9,4,Satan,"Oh Jesus Christ.
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"My Lord. My Lord, we must attack, now!
"
9,4,Satan,"What's the point?! They have a Keanu Reeves now.
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"Do not fear, my Lord. Your army is great!
"
9,4,Satan,"Very well.  Demon Army, begin your march on Heaven! 
"
9,4,Michael,"Up here, you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress. It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven.
"
9,4,Kenny,"(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)
"
9,4,Angel 6,"Simple. You will use... this. 
"
9,4,Michael,"This golden PSP is king of all PSPs.
"
9,4,Angels,"Hail the holy PSP.
"
9,4,Michael,"It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals.
"
9,4,Angel 7,"Gabriel returns with news!
"
9,4,Gabriel,"Hell's army is departing! They head now for the Gates of Heaven.
"
9,4,Michael,"Prepare the troops!  We must be ready for them!  The time is at hand, Kenny. The stage is set and the final battle between Heaven and Hell is about to begin! The fate of the outcome is in your hands.  Where'd he go?
"
9,4,Female Nurse,"Doctor! Doctor, we have a pulse!
"
9,4,The Doctor,"Then that's it! We brought him back.
"
9,4,Male Nurse,"Amazing, doctor! You've revived somebody who's been legally dead for almost a day!
"
9,4,The Doctor,"Call the parents. They're going to be shocked to find out... their son is alive.
"
9,4,The Doctor,"It's the latest in electro-plastilical science. Your son's organs are all functioning again.
"
9,4,Stuart,"It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive.
"
9,4,The Doctor,"I'm afraid he can't respond to you. You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny's brain cells died from lack of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in what we call a ""persistent vegetative state.""
"
9,4,Mrs. McCormick,"Will he ever recover?
"
9,4,The Doctor,"I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be repaired once dead. But his soul is still in here.  Almost... trapped in here, if you will. Kenny is the same as he ever was. It's just that, now, he's more like ...a tomato.
"
9,4,Stuart,"He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat?
"
9,4,The Doctor,"A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient paste directly into Kenny's stomach. With it we can actually keep Kenny the tomato alive for years.
"
9,4,Michael,"A feeding tube?!
"
9,4,Gabriel,"Yes. Apparently they're using machines to keep them alive.
"
9,4,Michael,"But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?!
"
9,4,Angel 3,"The child's soul is now trapped inside his vegetative body. We have no one to command the troops with the PSP.
"
9,4,Gabriel,"And Satan's armies are approaching.
"
9,4,Michael,"Oh, Goddammit.
"
9,4,Lawyer,"Boys I want to thank you for coming down to my office on such short notice. 
"
9,4,Stan,"Are we in trouble or something?
"
9,4,Lawyer,"No. Boys, I'm a lawyer. Your friend Kenny has passed away and I've called you here to read his will.
"
9,4,Kyle,"Kenny had a will?
"
9,4,Lawyer,"""In the highly likely event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have.""
"
9,4,Stan,"Oh wow...
"
9,4,Kyle,"That's... really touching.
"
9,4,Cartman,"(looking bored) Fags!
"
9,4,Lawyer,"To Eric Cartman: ""Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP.""
"
9,4,Cartman,"Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?
"
9,4,Lawyer,"There is one more thing I would like to ask you all, as my friends. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life-support, please,... 
"
9,4,Stan,"Please what?
"
9,4,Lawyer,"I don't know. I lost the last page.
"
9,4,Cartman,"Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?
"
9,4,Lawyer,"It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours.
"
9,4,Cartman,"Yes!
"
9,4,Man,"He's alive!
"
9,4,Stan,"What?
"
9,4,Man,"Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital! 
"
9,4,Kyle,"Oh my God! 
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"Your army nears the Kingdom of Heaven, my Lord.
"
9,4,Satan,"I don't know if we should continue without knowing more about this Keanu Reeves God has.
"
9,4,Spy Angel,"Satan! I come bearing good news! The Keanu Reeves boy has been revived on Earth! His soul is no longer in Heaven.
"
9,4,Satan,"Then God is helpless.  Full march, to the Gates of Heaven! Victory is ours!
"
9,4,Stan,"Kenny?
"
9,4,Kyle,"Kenny! You're alive!
"
9,4,Stan,"Dude, how'd you do that?
"
9,4,The Doctor,"He can't respond to you, boys. Being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain.
"
9,4,Cartman,"Well... well then he's NOT alive.
"
9,4,Mrs. McCormick,"He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think...
"
9,4,Cartman,"That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?
"
9,4,Stuart,"I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want.
"
9,4,Stan,"Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.
"
9,4,Cartman,"Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.
"
9,4,Mrs. McCormick,"He did? When?
"
9,4,Cartman,"Um, it was um, this one time...
"
9,4,Kyle,"He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
"
9,4,Cartman,"Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that?  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!
"
9,4,Kyle,"He did not!
"
9,4,Cartman,"Did so!
"
9,4,Kyle,"Did not!
"
9,4,Cartman,"Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! 
"
9,4,Peter,"Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo!
"
9,4,Gabriel,"Then they will be here on the morrow. Without Kenny's soul here there will be nobody who can use the holy PSP.
"
9,4,Uriel,"No! There is another. A Japanese boy did make it to level fifty-nine.
"
9,4,Michael,"Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people don't have souls!
"
9,4,Angel 9,"Yeah
"
9,4,Angel 10,"Yeah
"
9,4,Angel 11,"Yeah
"
9,4,Angel 12,"Yeah, Uriel!
"
9,4,Uriel,"Oh, right right, I'm sorry
"
9,4,Michael,"Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do.  Gabriel and Uriel, you go down to Earth and try to get that feeding tube removed. In the meantime  we will put all our troops at Heaven's Gate. We will try to keep Hell's Army from breaking through as long as possible.  Hopefully, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back.
"
9,4,Cartman,"You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.
"
9,4,Chief Justice,"Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents want their child kept alive. I don't believe you have any legal authority here.
"
9,4,Cartman,"I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.
"
9,4,Judge 2,"Best friends forever?
"
9,4,Cartman,"That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.
"
9,4,Mrs. McCormick,"Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again.
"
9,4,The Doctor,"But this just doesn't seem right.
"
9,4,Stuart,"Wha, what's the matter, doctor?
"
9,4,The Doctor,"I'm afraid I've been given a court order to remove Kenny's feeding tube.
"
9,4,Mrs. McCormick,"What?
"
9,4,Cartman,"He's right in here.
"
9,4,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
9,4,Chief Justice,"Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want to be kept alive artificially. The courts have determined we must obey his wish.
"
9,4,Kyle,"Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!
"
9,4,Police Officer,"Sir, take a look at this. 
"
9,4,Chief Justice,"That's all the verification we need. Pull the feeding tube, doctor.
"
9,4,Mrs. McCormick,"No doctor! You can't!
"
9,4,The Doctor,"I'm sorry. I have no choice. 
"
9,4,Gabriel,"Here is the hospital
"
9,4,Uriel,"This is hopeless, Gabriel. We cannot interact with anything on Earth, how could we possibly get a feeding tube removed?
"
9,4,Kyle,"That dirty no-good sonofabitch!
"
9,4,Stan,"Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! 
"
9,4,Gabriel,"The tube has been removed?
"
9,4,Kyle,"How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
"
9,4,Uriel,"Apparently, some blessed child has done our work for us.
"
9,4,Gabriel,"Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody interferes with the child's death a second time.
"
9,4,Kyle,"Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!
"
9,4,Stan,"Yeah!
"
9,4,Gabriel,"No!
"
9,4,Stan,"Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.
"
9,4,Kyle,"Yeah, come on! 
"
9,4,Uriel,"No! No, no boys! Aw Goddammit! 
"
9,4,Anchor,"This is HBC News. A right-to-die case debate is heating up in Colorado,  where Kenny McCormick's feeding tube has been removed by his BFF.  Two boys are bringing national attention to this story by protesting outside the hospital.
"
9,4,Stan,"Don't kill Kenny!
"
9,4,All,"You bastards!
"
9,4,Stan,"Don't kill Kenny!
"
9,4,All,"You bastards!
"
9,4,Uriel,"No! No, they're not killing him, they're letting him die!
"
9,4,Skeeter,"You bureaucrats have no right to play God and take that tube out!
"
9,4,Gabriel,"Nono, see, they were playing God when they put the feeding tube IN!
"
9,4,Anchor,"A woman was arrested for trying to bring food to the patient. 
"
9,4,Mrs. Garrison,"Get your man-hands off of me!
"
9,4,Anchor,"However, a growing number of people are also standing behind Kenny's BFF, Eric Cartman.
"
9,4,Man 1,"We must respect the wishes of people's BFFs. Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces would become meaningless
"
9,4,Man 2,"We all have BFFs, and we believe that a BFF is the highest legal authority.
"
9,4,Cartman,"That's right. Respect our authoritah.
"
9,4,Satan,"What mockery is this?!
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"My Lord...
"
9,4,Satan,"The feeding tube has been pulled! If the child dies and his soul returns to Heaven, God will have his Keanu Reeves!
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"Perhaps the child won't die in time.
"
9,4,Satan,"Forget it! I'm calling the attack off!
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"No! Keep your army marching, my Lord. I will get that feeding tube put back in. 
"
9,4,Satan,"How?
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"I will do what we always do: Use the Republicans.
"
9,4,George Bush,"We Republicans are deeply saddened by the tragic events in Colorado. 
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"Removing the feeding tube is murder, hughughughughughugh...
"
9,4,George Bush,"Removing the feeding tube is murder!
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?
"
9,4,George Bush,"Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"It is God's will that he live!
"
9,4,George Bush,"It is God's will that he LIVE!  Haaghaghaghaghaghagha...
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"No no, you don't say that part. 
"
9,4,George Bush,"No no, you don't say that part, haghaghaghagha. 
"
9,4,Angel 9,"Jesus, their army is massive.
"
9,4,Angel 10,"Heaven help us.
"
9,4,Anchor,"The biggest battle of all time is about to begin: the battle of the feeding tube! As people on both sides of the argument vie for media attention.
"
9,4,Kyle,"We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
"
9,4,Cartman,"I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!
"
9,4,Kyle,"You say tomato, but I say Kenny!
"
9,4,Cartman,"You say Kenny, but I say tomato! 
"
9,4,Cartman's Side,"Tomato!
"
9,4,Kyle's Side,"Kenny! Kenny!
"
9,4,Cartman's Side,"Tomato!
"
9,4,Judge,"Uuhh, excuse me. I uh, just found the last page of Kenny's will. 
"
9,4,Cartman,"What?
"
9,4,Judge,"I found the page where Kenny specified his wishes about being on life support.
"
9,4,Stan,"Well, what does it say?
"
9,4,Judge,"If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life support, please...  for the love of God, don't ever show me in that condition on national television. 
"
9,4,Stan,"Oooo.
"
9,4,Man,"Oowhoops
"
9,4,Kyle,"Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace.
"
9,4,Stan,"You mean, Cartman's side is right?
"
9,4,Kyle,"Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.
"
9,4,Both sides,"Yeah.
"
9,4,Kyle,"Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 
"
9,4,Anchor,"We've just received word that Kenny McCormick... has passed away. The debate still rages on in America, but at least now, Kenny... is in a much more peaceful place.
"
9,4,Angel 11,"The armies of Satan have already broken through the gate!
"
9,4,Angel 12,"We're gonna die!!!
"
9,4,Michael,"Send our troops to the battlefield! I'll command as best I can!
"
9,4,Gabriel,"Michael! Michael!  The humans finally did the right thing!
"
9,4,Michael,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Get him into the command station! Hurry!  Satan's army charges! Tell our troops what to do, Kenny!  So it begins.  Now we shall see the final battle between Heaven and Hell play out!  Yesss, good, Kenny! The angel spearmen are taking out their demon soul rippers! Oh, the cavalry angels are clashing with their Black Knights! Oh my God! My God, this battle is epic! Ohh, they're bringing in their demon dragons! Look at the size of them! My God, this is even bigger than the final battle in the Lord of the Rings movie! It's like, it's like TEN times bigger than that battle!
"
9,4,Satan,"No! NO! How are we losing?! 
"
9,4,Spy Angel,"The child's soul is in Heaven! God has his secret weapon!
"
9,4,Satan,"Full retreat!
"
9,4,Hooded Figure,"Patience, my Lord!
"
9,4,Satan,"No, Kevin!  That's it! I'm breaking up with you! 
"
9,4,Michael,"Yesss. Yes, Kenny! Satan's forces are retreating! This is TRULY a sight to behold! OH I wish I had a camcorder!  We have done it! We have defeated the armies of Satan! 
"
9,4,Peter,"Kenny! Bless your soul! You've saved all of Heaven!
"
9,4,Michael,"Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all you've done, we are going to give you a very special gift. For saving the entire universe from the forces of evil, we give you this.  Keanu Reeves' statue.  Congratulations. 
"
9,5,Kyle,"This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.
"
9,5,Local Announcer 1,"Now batting for Conifer is little Allen Varcas. 
"
9,5,Randy,"Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.
"
9,5,Mr. Varcas,"Hit it out of the park, Allen! South Park sucks!
"
9,5,Mr. Donovan,"Just look at those boys out there, lovin' the great game of baseball like we did when we were kids. 
"
9,5,Kyle,"Aw God, I'm so borrred. 
"
9,5,Butters,"I see a ladybug- Hello lady ladybug. 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Strike.
"
9,5,Mr. Varcas,"That was no strike! What the hell is wrong with you, ref?
"
9,5,Randy,"Good call, ref! Good call!
"
9,5,Mr. Varcas,"Come on, Allen! This pitcher throws like a girl!
"
9,5,Randy,"What'd you say?!
"
9,5,Mr. Varcas,"You heard me, asshole!
"
9,5,Randy,"You want me to kick your ass right here?! 
"
9,5,Sharon,"Randy, sit down.
"
9,5,Mr. Varcas,"You want a piece of me?! 'Cause I'm pretty sick of your Goddamned mouth!
"
9,5,Randy,"Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do?
"
9,5,Sharon,"Randy, don't!
"
9,5,Mr. Varcas,"You'd better shut up, asshole!
"
9,5,Randy,"I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?
"
9,5,Mr. Varcas,"I told you to SHUT UP! 
"
9,5,Stan,"Aw Jesus, not again.
"
9,5,Kyle,"Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Strike three! You're out!
"
9,5,Stan,"Yes! It's over! It's over!
"
9,5,Local Announcer 1,"That's it. South Park wins the game 4 to 0.
"
9,5,Cartman,"We're done! No more baseball!
"
9,5,Kyle,"No more boring baseball until next year!
"
9,5,Stan,"We can start having fun again! 
"
9,5,Cartman,"All right, we did it! 
"
9,5,Stan,"We did it! We did it!
"
9,5,Steven,"Yeah, we did it, boys! We did it! We're going to the finals! Woohoo! 
"
9,5,Stan,"... What?
"
9,5,Steven,"Well we won! That means we've got the best record in the division! 
"
9,5,Gerald,"Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!
"
9,5,Cartman,"Post-season?
"
9,5,Kyle,"Nobody said anything about a post-season.
"
9,5,Tom,"There's more little-league baseball for South Park! Yehheah! 
"
9,5,Stan,"No... NOOO!!
"
9,5,Randy,"This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! 
"
9,5,Kyle,"I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
"
9,5,Cartman,"Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!
"
9,5,Stan,"Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.
"
9,5,Craig,"Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us!
"
9,5,Stan,"I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.
"
9,5,Butters,"Well yeah, but... we usually win.
"
9,5,Craig,"All the other teams are worse than us.
"
9,5,Jimmy,"Yeah. Let's face it, we're winners.
"
9,5,Stan,"I know we can lose if we try.
"
9,5,Kyle,"You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
"
9,5,Butters,"Yeah. My dad always said ""It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister.""
"
9,5,The other boys,"Yeah, uh huh.
"
9,5,Stan,"Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.
"
9,5,Butters,"We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!
"
9,5,Gerald,"Boy, that was great, wasn't it?!
"
9,5,Mr. Donovan,"Yeah, our boys really stuck it to 'em! 
"
9,5,Randy,"Heeey!
"
9,5,Men,"Heeey!
"
9,5,Steven,"You're out. 
"
9,5,Gerald,"How much was bail this time? 
"
9,5,Stan,"Hundred bucks, no big whoop.
"
9,5,Richard,"Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad.
"
9,5,Randy,"Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
"
9,5,Steven,"Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself in the playoffs.
"
9,5,Randy,"Wha-what do you mean?
"
9,5,Steven,"I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy redneck dats up here in the mountains, but some of those Division Two dads are tough!
"
9,5,Gerald,"Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.
"
9,5,Randy,"I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
"
9,5,DJ,"...the Beatles in the White Album in Helter Skelter. Okay- 
"
9,5,FC Announcer,"We want to welcome all South Park parents to Fort Collins, and the Little League Division One Playoffs. 
"
9,5,Stan,"Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order.
"
9,5,FC Team,"Ooooo!
"
9,5,FC Fat Player,"I don't think so, South Park
"
9,5,FC Pitcher,"Yeah, you think we wanna win? Then we have to keep playing this boring game!
"
9,5,FC Team,"Yeah!
"
9,5,Kyle,"You hate this game too?
"
9,5,FC Batter,"Yeah! And then we won the stupid regionals and had to do this lousy-ass tournament!
"
9,5,FC Catcher,"We wanna play video games.
"
9,5,Butters,"Oh no!
"
9,5,Stan,"Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!
"
9,5,FC Pitcher,"I don't think so! There's no way you can lose to us! We're going doowwn! We're gonna get creeaamed!
"
9,5,Kyle,"No, we're gonna get creamed!
"
9,5,FC Batter,"We'll just see about that!
"
9,5,SP Team,"Oh yeah?
"
9,5,FC Team,"Yeah!
"
9,5,Randy,"Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!
"
9,5,Mr. Pratt,"Come on, Fort Collins! Let 'em have it! Yeah!
"
9,5,Randy,"Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. 
"
9,5,Cartman,"All right, hit one out of the park!
"
9,5,FC Announcer,"And first up for Fort Collins is... Morgan Pratt.
"
9,5,Randy,"Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter batteruuuuuuuupp batterbatterbatterbatter!
"
9,5,Mr. Pratt,"Knock it out of the park, Morgan! Cream these turds! 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Steerike!
"
9,5,Randy,"Yeah!
"
9,5,FC Team,"Yeah, all right!
"
9,5,Stan,"Damnit!
"
9,5,Cartman,"Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.
"
9,5,Morgan,"No way! I'm striking out!
"
9,5,Kyle,"Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Ball!
"
9,5,Cartman,"All right! 
"
9,5,FC Pitcher,"Morgan!
"
9,5,Morgan,"What?
"
9,5,FC Pitcher,"You have to swing when it's a ball, otherwise, you're gonna walk to first base. Don't swing, only if it's a strike!
"
9,5,Morgan,"Well how the Sam Hell am I supposed to know if he's gonna be throwing a strike or a ball?!
"
9,5,FC Pitcher,"You just have to guess.
"
9,5,Morgan,"Aw, Jesus! 
"
9,5,Cartman,"Ball. Balll. 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Steerike two!
"
9,5,Stan,"No!
"
9,5,Cartman,"That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!
"
9,5,Randy,"Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!
"
9,5,Mr. Pratt,"Come on Fort Collins! This team can't pitch!  There you go, Morgan! Run run run!
"
9,5,Morgan,"Aw damnit! 
"
9,5,FC Pitcher,"Why the hell did you swing at it?!
"
9,5,Morgan,"Well I thought he was gonna throw a ball that time! 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Strike three! You're out!
"
9,5,FC Batter 1,"All right!
"
9,5,Umpire,"Ball four!
"
9,5,Cartman,"What?!

9,5,Randy,"Walk to first! Woo!
"
9,5,Cartman,"Aw Goddamnit!

9,5,Umpire,"Safe!
"
9,5,Kyle,"Crud!

9,5,Randy,"Fort Collins can't play!
"
9,5,Mr. Pratt,"Why don't you shut your mouth before I kick your ass!
"
9,5,Randy,"Come on, let's go! I'm right here!
"
9,5,Sharon,"Randy...

9,5,Mr. Pratt,"Sit down before you get hurt!  Mother bitch! 
"
9,5,Stan,"Goddamnit... 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Strike three! 
"
9,5,FC Announcer,"That's it. South Park wins the game. 
"
9,5,Stan,"Aw spit!

9,5,Randy,"Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry!
"
9,5,Umpire,"Strike three. You're out.
"
9,5,Greeley Batter,"Yeah!
"
9,5,Greeley Team,"All right! Yeah! Woohoo!
"
9,5,Greeley Man,"Goddamnit Brian, swing!
"
9,5,Randy,"Greeley sucks! Greeley sucks!
"
9,5,Umpire,"Ball four!
"
9,5,Butters,"Aw hamburgers. 
"
9,5,SP Team,"God! 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Strike three!
"
9,5,Cartman,"How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first!
"
9,5,Randy,"What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America!
"
9,5,Umpire,"ЎStrrrrike tres!
"
9,5,Pueblo Team,"Bueno bueno! Bueno! Espectacular!
"
9,5,Pueblo Dad,"ЎVamonos Pueblo! ЎViva la Pueblo!
"
9,5,Randy,"ЎPueblo, no bueno! ЎPueblo es muy mal! 
"
9,5,Umpire,"ЎBall cuatro, por favor! 
"
9,5,Randy,"This is America! This is an honest America!
"
9,5,Steven,"Can you believe it, boys?! We're playing in the State Championship Game! 
"
9,5,Kyle,"We're so proud of you kids!
"
9,5,Cartman,"What happens if we win the State Championship game?
"
9,5,Steven,"Well, then your whole season starts over, but on the national circuit! You get to spend your whole summer playing baseball!
"
9,5,Kyle,"What?
"
9,5,Mr. Donovan,"You could do it, kids! We know you can win State!
"
9,5,Steven,"Then we'll spend the whole summer going to Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming.
"
9,5,Stan,"Oh no. No, no, no!
"
9,5,Stan,"Dad? Dad, we need to talk.
"
9,5,Randy,"Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever.
"
9,5,Stan,"Goddamnit. 
"
9,5,Randy,"I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game.  This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life.
"
9,5,Announcer,"This is News 4, at noon.
"
9,5,Anchor Tom,"The Colorado Little League State Championship is being played this week. Two teams of youngsters get to go head to head at the major-league stadium downtown.
"
9,5,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing here with the little sluggers and some of their parents, and I can't tell you how excited they are.
"
9,5,Stan,"I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
"
9,5,Denver Player,"Win? Why the hell would we want to win?
"
9,5,Denver Player 2,"Yeah. Then we'd have to play this boring game all summer.
"
9,5,Reporter,"Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for the South Park Little League team, and Stan, how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship?
"
9,5,Stan,"Gay.
"
9,5,Reporter,"Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son.
"
9,5,Randy,"They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really ""trash-talk,"" but, I don't think Denver has a chance.
"
9,5,Reporter Chris,"Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver kids' parents would disagree with you and your team-
"
9,5,Bat dad,"Oh yeah! Oh yeah!  South Park is goin' down! Feel it comin'!  You ain't got a chance, South Park! Here we go, Denver, here we go! Huh, huh!
"
9,5,Sheila,"Who's that?
"
9,5,A Woman,"That's Tom Nelson, one of the Denver players' fathers. He goes to every game in that ridiculous outfit and usually drinks too much and gets into a fight.
"
9,5,Tom Nelson,"There ain't no way some little mountain kids can beat Denver. Not with my son on second base!
"
9,5,Reporter Chris,"Oho, looks like we got some parental trash talking going on here. Mr. Marsh, any comments?
"
9,5,Randy,"Well I think that there's a uh...
"
9,5,Tom Nelson,"Mr. Marsh? Who wants to hear from a Mr. Marsh?! Iii am the ultimate Little League trash-talking father! Iii am the Bat Dad!
"
9,5,Denver Cop,"All right, Mr. Nelson, let's go, come on.
"
9,5,Tom Nelson,"Bat Dad knows no fear! Bat Dad knows no pain! I want you, Marsh! I want you!!
"
9,5,Reporter Chris,"Well, tension is certainly high here, but I guess everything will be decided on the playing field.
"
9,5,Randy,"Oh my God.
"
9,5,Denver Player 3,"Good luck! You're gonna need it.
"
9,5,Denver Player 4,"Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible. 
"
9,5,Kyle,"Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
"
9,5,Cartman,"Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.
"
9,5,Clyde,"Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.
"
9,5,Cartman,"Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.
"
9,5,Stan,"Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
"
9,5,Craig,"But who?
"
9,5,Kyle,"I know who.
"
9,5,Announcer,"Announcing the arrival of flight six seven three, from New York City. 
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"I'm baaack!
"
9,5,Kyle,"There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"Hello, cousin Kyle. Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible. They served a chicken dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas.
"
9,5,Kyle,"Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am. I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though. Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses.
"
9,5,Craig,"He's perfect.
"
9,5,Stan,"Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance.
"
9,5,Randy,"...I'm not gonna go. 
"
9,5,Sharon,"What?
"
9,5,Randy,"Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go.
"
9,5,Sharon,"Why?
"
9,5,Randy,"I just... don't think I can, all right?
"
9,5,Sharon,"You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-? 
"
9,5,Randy,"Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.
"
9,5,Sharon,"So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!
"
9,5,Randy,"Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.
"
9,5,Sharon,"No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself.
"
9,5,Randy,"I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. 
"
9,5,Announcer,"Welcoem to the Colorado Little League State Championship Game!  This must be pretty exciting for these youngsters. A chance to go to the national circuit. 
"
9,5,Denver Pitcher,"You know what these guys look like to me? A bunch of winners!
"
9,5,Denver Catcher,"Yeah! We're about to get our asses kicked!
"
9,5,Cartman,"I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
"
9,5,Denver Pitcher,"You're the best!
"
9,5,Kyle,"You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
"
9,5,Denver Pitcher,"Not a chance, 'cause we're gonna lose to you right now!
"
9,5,Bat Dad,"Here we go, Denver! These South Park kids got nothin' on you! Let's go, Denver!
"
9,5,Woman,"Chris, will you sit down?
"
9,5,Announcer,"First up to bat for South Park, Kyle Schwartz. 
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"Where do I stand?
"
9,5,Umpire,"R-right over here. 
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"Don't throw the ball too fast, because I might get startled and I have asthma. 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Strike 1!
"
9,5,SP Team,"Yeah! All right!
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"Jesus, not so close! That was three feet from hitting me in the head!
"
9,5,Second Baseman,"He's not gonna swing! Throw balls!
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"Oh Jesus!
"
9,5,Umpire,"Strike 2!
"
9,5,SP Team,"Yeah!
"
9,5,Stan,"Wow, he IS great at sucking.
"
9,5,Cartman,"We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"Don't throw it so hard or so close next time! Is it cold out here? I think I need a jacket. 
"
9,5,Umpire,"It's a bunt!
"
9,5,Mr. Donovan,"Run kid, run!
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"Oh Jesus! 
"
9,5,Kyle,"Aw crap! 
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"I can't, I can't keep running like this! I have corns in my feet!
"
9,5,Steven,"Keep running, kid! 
"
9,5,Bat Dad,"Throw the ball to third, you idiots! He's runnin' home! 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Safe! 
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"Oh Jesus, did you see that? I hit a homerun! High-five, everybody! 
"
9,5,Kyle,"Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
"
9,5,Stan,"Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. 
"
9,5,Token,"No!
"
9,5,Mr. Williams,"Yeeaahh! Go Token go!
"
9,5,Bat Dad,"All right, Denver! You're up to bat now! 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Out!
"
9,5,Denver Team,"Yaaay!
"
9,5,Kyle,"Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
"
9,5,Butters,"Son of a biscuit!
"
9,5,Announcer,"It's the bottom of the last inning here at Coors Field; the score is South Park 23, Denver 0. 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Strike 1!
"
9,5,Bat Dad,"Come on, Denver! Get the lead out! Do not cross the Bat Daaad!
"
9,5,Gerald,"Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.
"
9,5,Bat Dad,"Why don't you just go home, South Park? You can't beat Denver!
"
9,5,A Voice,"Denver sucks ass!  Come on, South Park! These kids can't play! In fact, these kids are terrible! 
"
9,5,Umpire,"Strike 2!
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"Oh Jesus, we're gonna win! I I never won a sport before; this is so exciting.
"
9,5,Randy,"It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!
"
9,5,Bat Dad,"You'd better shut your mouth before I shut it for you!
"
9,5,Randy,"What do you wanna do, huh? 
"
9,5,Stan,"This can't get any worse. 
"
9,5,Bat Dad,"Now for the finishing move! You're about to be Bat-Dadded! 
"
9,5,Commentator,"It all comes down to this! South Park is just one pitch away from being State Champions.  Oh geez, it looks like two parents are fighting. They'd better be careful. The Little League has a no-tolerance policy.
"
9,5,Umpire,"Stop! Stop, or you're gonna get your teams disqualified!
"
9,5,Stan,"Disqualified?  Fight! Keep fighting! 
"
9,5,Umpire 2,"Break it up! Break it up!  That's enough! The next person that fights is getting his team disqualified!
"
9,5,Bat Dad,"He's done for anyway. 
"
9,5,Stan,"Come on, Dad! Get up!
"
9,5,Kyle,"Get up! You have to fight! 
"
9,5,Umpire 2,"All right, come on! Let's play ball!
"
9,5,SP Team,"Randy! Randy! Randy!
"
9,5,Mickey,"Get up, Randy! Get up, ya bum!
"
9,5,Sharon,"Get up, Randy! Fight! Fight for me!
"
9,5,Crowd,"Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
"
9,5,Randy,"Hey Bat Dad!  I didn't hear no bell.
"
9,5,SP Team,"Yeah! 
"
9,5,Umpire 2,"Stop, stop right now!  I'm warning you, sir!  That's it! That's it! South Park is disqualified!
"
9,5,SP Team,"Yeah!
"
9,5,SP Adults,"Aww!
"
9,5,Commentator,"South Park has been disqualified from the game! Denver wins! 
"
9,5,Kyle 1,"We... We lost.
"
9,5,Randy,"What? I thought this was a free country! 
"
9,5,Stan,"Dad!  You're the greatest. 
"
9,6,Stan,"Dude, where is she? We can't wait.
"
9,6,Kyle,"God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!
"
9,6,Sharon,"Hi boys.
"
9,6,Stan,"Mom!
"
9,6,Kyle,"She's here!
"
9,6,Cartman,"She's got Colonel!
"
9,6,Kyle,"I want some!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Oh boy!
"
9,6,Stan,"I want a breast!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?
"
9,6,Sharon,"Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can help bring in the other groceries in the car, then have your chicken.
"
9,6,The Boys,"Awww!
"
9,6,Stan,"But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!
"
9,6,Sharon,"It won't take a minute.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.
"
9,6,Stan,"All right.
"
9,6,Kyle,"Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. 
"
9,6,Stan,"Okay, this is everything, mom. 
"
9,6,Kyle,"All right, let's eat Colonel! 
"
9,6,Stan,"Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Well, I saved you all the chicken part. 
"
9,6,Kyle,"The skin's the best part...
"
9,6,Cartman,"Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. 
"
9,6,Stan,"I can't believe that fat asshole!
"
9,6,Kyle,"You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
"
9,6,Stan,"Well this time he's gone too far!
"
9,6,Kenny,"(Yeah, fuck him!)
"
9,6,Stan,"Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?
"
9,6,Kyle,"Hello?? I've been saying this for years!
"
9,6,Stan,"Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!
"
9,6,Kyle,"Yes, but he thrives on that.
"
9,6,Stan,"All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.
"
9,6,Kenny,"(Fuck yeah!)
"
9,6,Kyle,"That sounds great!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. 
"
9,6,Kyle,"Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
"
9,6,Stan,"I think I have extra.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?
"
9,6,Stan,"Here you go.
"
9,6,Kyle,"Thanks. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off?  Kenny? Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!  Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I can't be dead.  I can't be dead!!
"
9,6,Black Plumber,"All right, ma'am. We've got your new toilet installed and we'll haul away the old one away for ya.
"
9,6,Liane,"Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you.
"
9,6,Black Plumber,"Hunh, I could think of a few ways, hunh.
"
9,6,Liane,"Ohoho, nhn.
"
9,6,Cartman,"No! No!!
"
9,6,Fat Plumber,"What happened? Did they say?
"
9,6,Thin Plumber,"Apparently there was so much chicken skin in the system it just ruptured the insides.
"
9,6,Fat Plumber,"Aww, that's tragic.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Oh my God, this can't be happening!  Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!  Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why??? 
"
9,6,Jimmy,"Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman? 
"
9,6,Stan,"Cartman isn't our friend anymore. 
"
9,6,Kyle,"We're ignoring him.
"
9,6,Token,"Ignoring him? How come?
"
9,6,Kyle,"Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
"
9,6,Token,"Oh yeah.
"
9,6,Craig,"Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you?
"
9,6,Blond,"Yeah.
"
9,6,Kevin,"Me too.
"
9,6,Other boys,"Yeah, screw him! Yeah.
"
9,6,Clyde,"I never realized ignoring him was an option.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You guys??  Token, Token, I'm here!  Hello! Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can't you feel me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!  They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.
"
9,6,Woman,"What is that kid doing?
"
9,6,Man,"Ah I don't know, just ignore him.
"
9,6,Butters,"Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-
"
9,6,Cartman,"What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!
"
9,6,Butters,"Hey Eric! 
"
9,6,Cartman,"...What did you say?
"
9,6,Butters,"Huh I just said, ""Hey Eric!""
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters...  Butters! You can see me??
"
9,6,Butters,"Well, sure I can see you.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Oh my God, and you can hear me??
"
9,6,Butters,"Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?
"
9,6,Cartman,"Because, Butters, I'm... dead. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!
"
9,6,Butters,"You died?? How??
"
9,6,Cartman,"I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
"
9,6,Butters,"But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?
"
9,6,Cartman,"I don't know, but you're the only one who can.
"
9,6,Butters,"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!
"
9,6,Linda,"Butters, what on earth are you doing??
"
9,6,Butters,"Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
"
9,6,Linda,"Dead people?
"
9,6,Stephen,"Who's seeing dead people?
"
9,6,Butters,"Me! I saw a ghost!
"
9,6,Stephen,"Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts.
"
9,6,Butters,"But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
"
9,6,Stephen,"Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you.
"
9,6,Butters,"Ruh, really?
"
9,6,Stephen,"Yeess.
"
9,6,Butters,"So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
"
9,6,Stephen,"That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS.
"
9,6,Butters,"Huh s-s-super-AIDS?
"
9,6,Stephen,"That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years.
"
9,6,Butters,"AAAH!  Oh Jesus.
"
9,6,Stephen,"So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS.
"
9,6,Butters,"Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters...
"
9,6,Butters,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters, you have to help me!
"
9,6,Butters,"Go away! You aren't real!
"
9,6,Cartman,"All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. 
"
9,6,Butters,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
9,6,Stephen,"Butters, what is going on?!
"
9,6,Butters,"Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
"
9,6,Stephen,"Well you'd better stop having nightmares or eles you're gonna be grounded!
"
9,6,Butters,"Y yes, yes sir. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters.
"
9,6,Butters,"AH- 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!
"
9,6,Butters,"But I don't want to see you!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.
"
9,6,Butters,"Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
"
9,6,Cartman,"What do you mean?
"
9,6,Butters,"Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
"
9,6,Cartman,"I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!
"
9,6,Butters,"Oh.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
"
9,6,Butters,"I can't. Ahah I have school tomorrow.
"
9,6,Cartman,"This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! 
"
9,6,Butters,"Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!
"
9,6,Butters,"Mrs. Cartman?
"
9,6,Liane,"Yes?  Oh hi.
"
9,6,Butters,"This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.
"
9,6,Liane,"Oh, what is it?
"
9,6,Cartman,"Tell her, tell her that I love her.
"
9,6,Butters,"He says, he love you. 
"
9,6,Liane,"Oh, that's so nice.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!
"
9,6,Butters,"He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
"
9,6,Cartman,"It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!
"
9,6,Butters,"He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.
"
9,6,Liane,"Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! 
"
9,6,Butters,"Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Just the good times.
"
9,6,Kyle,"There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
"
9,6,Cartman,"I can't! Don't you understand?!
"
9,6,Butters,"He can't! Don't you understand?!
"
9,6,Cartman,"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!
"
9,6,Butters,"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!
"
9,6,Cartman,"All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. 
"
9,6,Butters,"Uhh alright then. 
"
9,6,Stan,"Who was that?
"
9,6,Kyle,"It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
"
9,6,Stan,"Dude, he did that to me this morning.
"
9,6,Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
9,6,Kyle,"He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
"
9,6,Kenny,"(That guy would try anything)
"
9,6,Stan,"Yeah, we know better than to think that.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.
"
9,6,Butters,"Aww, that's okay, Eric.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.
"
9,6,Butters,"So I won't see you again?
"
9,6,Cartman,"Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.
"
9,6,Butters,"Wow.
"
9,6,Cartman,"G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! 
"
9,6,Butters,"Yeh you're still here.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?
"
9,6,Butters,"Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.
"
9,6,Cartman,"What else do I have to do?!
"
9,6,Butters,"Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Atone?
"
9,6,Butters,"Did you ever do anything really bad?
"
9,6,Cartman,"Not really...
"
9,6,Cartman,"Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.
"
9,6,Butters,"Broke fence...
"
9,6,Cartman,"I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.
"
9,6,Butters,"Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Really?
"
9,6,Butters,"Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
"
9,6,Cartman,"I know how.
"
9,6,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna make, make it right.
I'm gonna take a little time and set things right.
Make, make it right.
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
It feels so good to be making up
For all the things I've done wrong.
I know now what the Good Lord in Heaven
Wanted from me all along.
All along, I'm gonna make, make it right.
'Cause Jesus wants me to have a clean slate.
Not faking it, I'm making it right.
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
Make, make it right!
Make, make it right!
Gonna make it right, girl, I've got to have your lovin' tonight!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.
"
9,6,Butters,"Does this mean... you have to go now?
"
9,6,Cartman,"Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!
"
9,6,Butters,"Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
"
9,6,Cartman,"I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?
"
9,6,Butters,"Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God! 
"
9,6,Stephen,"Butters! What have you done?!
"
9,6,Butters,"Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
"
9,6,Linda,"Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor.
"
9,6,Stephen,"No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him.
"
9,6,Linda,"What do you think, Doctor?
"
9,6,Doctor,"Your son is suffering from severe dementia. He claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him. This is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the child's past. I think it's best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests.
"
9,6,Linda,"Oh no.  NO!
"
9,6,Doctor,"All right, Butters, just try to relax.  Doin' just fine, Butters.  Just stay perfectly still now, Butters.
"
9,6,Butters,"Lu lu lu, lu lu lu 
"
9,6,Doctor,"Good. You're gonna feel a little pinch now, Butters.  Don't worry, Mr. Stotch. Whatever traumatized your son in his past, we'll find it. 
"
9,6,Doctor,"Well, after fourteen hours of testing, I can say Butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressed memory syndrome. You see, Butters, when the brain wants to cover something up, it makes up images and sounds for you to hear.
"
9,6,Butters,"So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
"
9,6,Stephen,"Now do you believe us, Butters?
"
9,6,Butters,"Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.
"
9,6,Doctor,"Good. We're making a lot of headway. We'll do some more testing tomorrow. All right, folks. Let's let Butters get some rest. 
"
9,6,Linda,"Goodnight, baby. 
"
9,6,Butters,"Ahhh. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters.
"
9,6,Butters,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.
"
9,6,Butters,"Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.
"
9,6,Cartman,"I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!
"
9,6,Butters,"Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
"
9,6,Cartman,"She's gonna close soon! Come on! 
"
9,6,Butters,"Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!
"
9,6,Butters,"Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?
"
9,6,Psychic,"Certainly. Come in.  Have a seat and tell me what it is you seek.
"
9,6,Butters,"Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.
"
9,6,Psychic,"Well, many times, the reason that the soul stays Earth-bound is because God is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose, to help prevent an impending tragic event.
"
9,6,Butters,"Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!
"
9,6,Psychic,"But now, you shouldn't think you're crazy, young man. I see ghosts all the time.
"
9,6,Butters,"Really?
"
9,6,Psychic,"Yes. When's the last time you saw yours?
"
9,6,Butters,"Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.
"
9,6,Psychic,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
9,6,Butters,"Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.
"
9,6,Cartman,"I told you, Butters. 
"
9,6,Announcer,"This is breaking news!
"
9,6,Anchor Tom,"A tragic event is unfolding in South Park. Three convicted murderers have escaped from jail and are holding twelve people hostage at the Red Cross!
"
9,6,Reporter Chris,"Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the Red Cross behind me, and threatened to kill all the workers inside. The violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!
"
9,6,Officer,"Stay back, people!
"
9,6,Man,"Stay back?! Hell, my wife and child are in there!
"
9,6,Det. Yates,"Stay calm in there. We don't want anybody getting hurt.
"
9,6,Lead Convict,"You get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars or these people start dyin', man!
"
9,6,Cartman,"All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.
"
9,6,Butters,"Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Don't worry. I have a plan. 
"
9,6,Butters,"Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal.
"
9,6,Cartman,"They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. 
"
9,6,Det. Yates,"What the hell is that kid doing?
"
9,6,Bald Convict,"Somebody's comin' in!
"
9,6,Convict 2,"It's just some little fat kid. 
"
9,6,Bald Convict,"What the hell is going on?
"
9,6,Convict 2,"I have no idea.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Yes, it's working! 
"
9,6,Lead Convict,"This is really weird. 
"
9,6,Reporter Chris,"An incredible development here, Tom. Two little boys have fearlessly gone inside the Red Cross. 
"
9,6,Stan,"Cartman?
"
9,6,Bald Convict,"I'm so confused! 
"
9,6,Butters,"Hurry. Go, go! 
"
9,6,Officer 2,"The hostages are clear!
"
9,6,Det. Yates,"All right, move in! 
"
9,6,Convict 2,"The hostages are gone!
"
9,6,Bald Convict,"What?!  Son of a bitch.
"
9,6,Reporter Chris,"Tom, an incredible story of courage. Two little boys, armed only with the weapon of confusion, managed to go in and save the Red Cross. Nobody seems to know who the boys are or where they went off to, but they are heroes.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.
"
9,6,Butters,"Boy, we sure did.
"
9,6,Cartman,"My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.
"
9,6,Butters,"Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.
"
9,6,Cartman,"We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.
"
9,6,Butters,"I'll miss you too, ghost pal.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! 
"
9,6,Stan,"Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.
"
9,6,Clyde,"Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now. 
"
9,6,Kyle,"We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
"
9,6,Stan,"Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.
"
9,6,Jimmy,"Yeah. S-see ya, Eric. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"You sonofabitch Butters!
"
9,6,Butters,"Huh?
"
9,6,Cartman,"You told me I was a ghost!
"
9,6,Butters,"Huh but I thought you were one!
"
9,6,Cartman,"How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  GET YOU BACK! 
"
9,6,Stephen,"Butters?!
"
9,6,Butters,"Oh hamburgers.
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know it can sometimes be difficult to talk about subjects like drugs and sex and alcohol, m'kay? So, as you remember, last week I told you to write down any difficult questions you had and put them in this box anonymously so we could discuss in class, m'kay? I got a lot o' responses, so let's read some aloud.  ""Mr. Mackey is gay.""  Okay kids, that is not funny! M'kay?! This box is supposed to be used for serious questions! About, about serious issues! M'kay, let's let's stop the tomfoolery!  M'kay, this looks like a real one here.  ""Dear Mr. Mackey, you are gay.""  All right, all right. That's enough, kids. Let's quiet down and try to be mature, 'kay?  Uh here we go. Okay, ""Mr. Mackey, sometimes my parents hit me, and you are gay.""  dammit, is there not one serious question in here?!  ""Mr. Mackey is gay, Mr. Mackey is gay""  Okay, here.  I am a boy at South Park Elementary. Sometimes, when I'm sitting in class, my penis becomes hard for no reason. What should I do?  All right kids, all right kids, that's enough!  If you all can't be serious about the question box,  then we'll just do drug identification exercises, unkay?!
"
9,7,Class,"Awwwww!
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come up here and write down the names of two narcotics?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Uh no, that-that's okay, Mr. Mackey.
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"Jimmy, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Uhhh, just uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey.
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well why the hell not?!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Uh... 
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"He's what... Oh, you do? R-right now, right now it is? M'kay, m'kay. Don't worry, Jimmy.  N'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else. Um, Eric, why don't you come up here?
"
9,7,Cartman,"Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now. 
"
9,7,Stan,"He's what?? 
"
9,7,Stan,"A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.
"
9,7,Kyle,"Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hey fellas.
"
9,7,Stan,"Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Oh I sure have. I've been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long
"
9,7,Kyle,"I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone.  Aaah!
"
9,7,Kyle,"Huh wuh, what's the matter?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas.  Eh, excuse me! Evuh evuh - excuh, cuh, cuse me! Excuse me, puh-please. 
"
9,7,Craig,"It's occupied. 
"
9,7,Cartman,"No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. 
"
9,7,Butters,"Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?
"
9,7,Butters,"Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!
"
9,7,Cartman,"Up yours, Butters.
"
9,7,Sarah,"Hey Jimmy, how was school?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Fine, Mom.
"
9,7,Ryan,"Jimmy, we understand you're getting erections in the classroom.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"What? Uh who told you that?
"
9,7,Ryan,"Mr. Mackey, your counselor.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus!
"
9,7,Ryan,"Now, Jimmy, it's nothing to be ashamed of. But we know it's something you might have a hard time talking about. Get it? A hard time. So, we took your counselor's advice 'nd called Doctor Pal to help us all talk about this.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Dz-n-Doctor Pal?
"
9,7,Doctor Pal,"Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal. That's because I'm a doctor, but I'm also your pal. Are we cool?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Uh, sure?
"
9,7,Doctor Pal,"A lot of times parents call me in because I can relate to younger kids. I'm I'm down, I'm dope, you dig? Now, I understand you have some concerns about erections.  ""Oops, can't say erection in front of the parents right. Oh God, I feel so weird"" huh?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well, a little, yes.
"
9,7,Doctor Pal,"Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random erections. Almost every boy goes through a phase where his penis becomes hard... for no particular reason. It's just part of growing up. Growing up? Growing out is more like it. 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday.
"
9,7,Doctor Pal,"Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don't you skedaddle for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo.
"
9,7,Ryan,"A-all right, come on, honey. 
"
9,7,Doctor Pal,"Jimmy, as you get older your body goes through a lot of changes. Certain hormones start to release as your whole reproductive system begins to awaken, and so, if you like, we can take off our shirts and kiss.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Ke...c-come again?
"
9,7,Doctor Pal,"Oh, hey, nothin', you see? See, that set you off on a different tangent, got you thinkin' a different way. That's what Doctor Pal is here to do.  Unless, of course, you think we should take off our shirts and kiss.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss
"
9,7,Doctor Pal,"Well then to hell with you, kid. You can just deal with your problems on your own. 
"
9,7,Announcer,"Next up for the talent show, put your hands together for the incredibly talented Jimmy Valmer! 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She's very excited to get started on her new show, ""Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet.""  So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. Have you seen this, have you heard about this?  A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope, a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic.  Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson is having back problem in court.  You know... huh... you uh you know what they say about b-b-b-b-back problems.  Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience.  What a fantastic audience.
"
9,7,Mrs. Garrison,"Don't worry, Jimmy. We're not laughing with you, we're laughing AT you. 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Nuh uh! Wuh. Huh. Waaagh! Ungh! 
"
9,7,Butters,"Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Butters!
"
9,7,Butters,"Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me.
"
9,7,Butters,"Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard?
"
9,7,Butters,"Well sure I do.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Really??
"
9,7,Butters,"Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her ""vagiiina.""  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?
"
9,7,Butters,"That's right, Jimmy.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday.
"
9,7,Girl,"Talk to you, Bertha.
"
9,7,Bertha,"Okay, see you later, Jessie.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hey Bertha.
"
9,7,Bertha,"Oh, hey Jimmy. What's goin' on?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina?
"
9,7,Bertha,"What?? No way! 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"But the talent show is tomorrow!  Ooo!
"
9,7,Bertha,"Jerk! 
"
9,7,Cartman,"Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?
"
9,7,Cartman,"Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before?
"
9,7,Cartman,"Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well, wha-what do I do?
"
9,7,Cartman,"I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch.
"
9,7,Cartman,"Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow! Thanks, Eric.
"
9,7,Mom,"Shawna honey, I think your little date is here.
"
9,7,Shawna,"Okay, Mom. 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hey Shawna.
"
9,7,Shawna,"Hi Jimmy.
"
9,7,Cartman,"Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, Shawna, you look f-fantastic.
"
9,7,Shawna,"Thanks, Jimmy. Where are we going?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini
"
9,7,Waiter,"Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for the authentico experience Italiano. My name is Roma. Can I start you out with some lotsa pasta macaroni minis?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers.
"
9,7,Waiter,"Right away. 
"
9,7,Shawna,"You know that girl Sally Rauman at our school? I can't stand her.
"
9,7,Cartman,"Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, ""Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.""
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.
"
9,7,Shawna,"Really? Well, Kelligan bought the same purse and I was like, ""No WAY do I want it now!"" because who wants a purse that both their best friends have, right? And so-
"
9,7,Cartman,"All right, when she stops yappin' again, say ""Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.""
"
9,7,Shawna,"I guess that's why I figured, ""Who needs friends like THAT?""
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.
"
9,7,Shawna,"It's like I told Debbie: ""If you're gonna go out with my friends-""
"
9,7,Cartman,"All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with ""Wow, how insightful.""
"
9,7,Shawna,"""And so if you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend.""
"
9,7,Jimmy,"""If you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend."" Wow, how insightful.
"
9,7,Shawna,"You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Really?
"
9,7,Shawna,"Yeah. I mean, no other boys really communicate like you do.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shawna, because I really wanna stick my penis in your vagina.
"
9,7,Cartman,"Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.
"
9,7,Shawna,"...What???  I'm not doing that!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"But the talent show is tomorrow night!
"
9,7,Shawna,"Creep! 
"
9,7,Cartman,"Aaagh!
"
9,7,Mrs. Garrison,"Welcome students and parents to the annual South Park Elementary Talent Show!  We have a lot of little talneted performers to get through, so the quicker you shut up, the quicker this will be over!  Okay, first up we have Billy Turner, from the third grade, who will be doing an alto sax solo. 
"
9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Jimmy? Jimmy Valmer?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Oh... Hi, Officer B b-b-buh b-b-buh b-Barbrady.
"
9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show. 
"
9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Not perform?  But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I just c-can't risk getting up in front of everyone.
"
9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Why?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"All right! I I keep getting an erection for no reason! Okay! But I can't get any of the girls here to let me... do it to them.
"
9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don't wanna have it in their vaginas? It's like a cruel joke.
"
9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"...Colfax Point?
"
9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Really? M-maybe I can catch the bus ...and get down there before the talent show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady! 
"
9,7,Officer Barbrady,"You're welcome, Jim.  Wait...
"
9,7,Voice-over,"Colfax Point. Pimps and hos and tricks in rows. Women walk the street with corns on their feets. Broken dreams and no ice creams.
"
9,7,Ho,"You lookin' for a date?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hello? Hello? I need to put my ...p-penis in a woman's vagina. Any takers?  Excuse me, ma'am. What's your name?
"
9,7,Prostitute,"They call me Nut Gobbler.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well, Nut Gobbler, I need to get laid.
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Huh??
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I have a raging hard-on that just won't quit, and the talent show has already started.
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"You a cop?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"No. Actually, I'm a stand-up comic.
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"You got money?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Sure do.
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"All right, you got a place to go?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Sure. I know the p-perfect place.
"
9,7,Roma,"Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for the authentic experienso Italiano. My name is Roma, and uhhh  Oh, it's so nice to see you again, Mr. Valmer.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hey, can it, jackass! I just don't want them to know I was here with a different girl.
"
9,7,Roma,"Oh right, pardone, segnore. I'll come back with some garlic bread mediterraneane. 
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"What are we doin' anyway?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"This is authentic Italian food straight from S-Sicily. You should try the Lotsa Mozzarella Pizza Roll.
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"I can't eat too much, I've got an infected urinary tract. I've been pissin' blood for a week.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Huh?  Well, that's it, I just piss blood! So I have to stick a tampon up my peehole.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow. You know, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. If you're pissing blood, you can shove a tampon up your peehole. You are very insightful. Please tell me more.
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Look, kid, what are you doin'?! You wanna get laid or not?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well of couse I wanna get laid. That's why I'm taking you to this ...fancy place and pretending to be interested in what you have to say..
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Kid, I'm a hooker. You don't have to take me to dinner OR be nice to me.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"What? Fo-for real?
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"You paid me, so you get to do me. It's that simple.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well jumpin' Jesus, what are we wasting our time here for then? The talent show is happening right now! Let's get to r-r-rammin'! 
"
9,7,Pimp,"What are you doin', ho?! Havin' dinner?! You're supposed to be workin' for me!
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"It's where the trick wanted to go, you bastard!
"
9,7,Pimp,"Trick?! I ain't stupid! Ain't no trick gonna take you out to dinner!  This PIMP is tryin' to steal you away from me!  This is MY ho!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I beg to differ with you, sir. I paid for her and took her out to dinner. She's my ho!
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Uh Jesus.
"
9,7,Pimp,"You got a problem, bitch?!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Yes, I do have a problem, as a matter of fact! I've spent all my money on this ho, and she's now my only shot at getting laid, and the talent show is only a couple of hours from being over.
"
9,7,Pimp,"You're comin' home right now! 
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Agh! Let go of my hair, you son of a bitch!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Sir, sir, that is my ho!
"
9,7,Pimp,"I'm gonna kick your ass, ho! 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Sir, sir!
"
9,7,Stan,"Woof.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Son of a ...b-bitch!  Taxi!  Follow that pimp and ho! 
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Where are you taking me?!
"
9,7,Pimp,"I'm gonna kill you, ho!
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"No! Please! Q Money! I'm sorry!
"
9,7,Q Money,"You're already dead, ho! 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking her, you are no better than a common th-thief!
"
9,7,Q Money,"Fuck you, punk! 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Nut Gobbler, grab onto my crutch! 
"
9,7,Q Money,"Get your ass back in here, ho!
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Aaaah! 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I got you, Nut Gobbler! 
"
9,7,Tall Goth,"No no nono no, I'm not gonna be in the talent show. Oh no nono no. I'll never be in your faggy talent show. 
"
9,7,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, that was the Goth kids with ""Talent Shows Are For Fags""
"
9,7,Tall Goth,"That was killer. We showed them.
"
9,7,Red Goth,"Yeah, I hope we win.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Come on, ho! 
"
9,7,Cabbie,"Look out!
"
9,7,Motorcyclist,"Daww?
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Aah??  NO!  '
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Eugh! Stay on him! I'm not giving up! 
"
9,7,Kid Magician,"Tada! 
"
9,7,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, very nice, Clark and Laura. Very nice.  Our next act is Butters, who will be singing a song
"
9,7,Stephen,"There's our boy. 
"
9,7,Butters,"Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo! 
"
9,7,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, thank you Butters, very nice, short and sweet. 
"
9,7,Q Money,"Goddamn, this pimp just won't give up!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Get close to him!  How much do I owe you?
"
9,7,Cabbie,"Six dollars and twenty-four cents.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"C-can I just get two back, please?
"
9,7,Cabbie,"Oh, thank you very much.  There you go. Have a good 'n.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Thank you. 
"
9,7,Q Money,"You're gonna pay for this, bitch!
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"No! Heelllp!!  Haaaaaaaaaa!!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Don't worry, Nut Gobbler! I'm coming!  Oh Jesus, not now.  Oh boy, this is embarrassing. 
"
9,7,Mrs. Garrison,"And now we have Eric Cartman, who will be doing select readings from the movie, Scarface. 
"
9,7,Cartman,"D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say ""That's the bad guy!"" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!
"
9,7,Liane,"That's my little boy. 
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Please, Q Money! Don't do this!
"
9,7,Q Money,"I told you never to turn on me, ho!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hey, j-j-jackass!  I'm sorry I resorted to calling you jackass just now, but I'm very upset!
"
9,7,Q Money,"And what are you gonna do, huh?! I've got four feet on you AND a gun! What do you have?!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"What do I have? The weapon of comedy. So apparently the Chinese and the Japanese aren't getting along lately. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
"
9,7,Q Money,"What?!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't been getting along with my stomach for years.
"
9,7,Q Money,"That's pretty good.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
"
9,7,Q Money,"Oh yeah. That's right, she is. 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"She's apparently gotten real good with baking cakes with keys in them. 
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Serves you right, you son of a bitch!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Nice teamwork, Nut Gobbler.
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"I can't believe you chased me all this way. You, you really care about me.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Not really. You're just a hooker, and I need to get laid. The talent show could be over any minute.
"
9,7,Nut Gobbler,"That's good enough for me.  Take me to bed. 
"
9,7,Ike,"I have a Yankee Doodle sweetheart,She's my Yankee Doodle girl.'Ankee Doodle came to London,Just to ride the ponies,I am da Yankee DoodleI am da Yankee DoodleI am da Yankee Doodle boy.
"
9,7,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, very nice, Ike, thank you. All right, children, it looks like we have no more contestants, which means, the Talent Show is over! 
"
9,7,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Mackey, it's over.
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"Huh?  Oh oh oh, right.
"
9,7,Mrs. Garrison,"Now we will tally up the judges' scores and find out which act they hated the least.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hold everything!  Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind, I'll be taking that microphone..
"
9,7,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, let's put our hands together for Jimmy Valmer. 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, what a terrific audience. So apparently it's been exactly two years since the fall of Baghdad. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Just as B-Bush predicted, Baghdad fell, Iraq fell, Saddam fell. The only thing that didn't fall was ...the price of gas.  I just read in the paper that China's protesting Japan. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah, I guess in China you don't get to-  You've gotta be kidding me.
"
9,8,Stan,"Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.
"
9,8,Stan,"Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.
"
9,8,Cartman,"You know how?
"
9,8,Stan,"Sure I do!
"
9,8,Cartman,"Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.
"
9,8,Stan,"Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility.
"
9,8,Stan,"Okay, turn on the ignition,
"
9,8,Cartman,"Awesome.
"
9,8,Stan,"Okay... 
"
9,8,Cartman,"We're not moving.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Maybe you have the parking brake on.
"
9,8,Stan,"Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! 
"
9,8,Cartman,"Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!
"
9,8,Stan,"Jesus Christ!!!
"
9,8,Cartman,"Stan... beaver dam!  Very large beaver dam, Stan!! 
"
9,8,Stan,"Oh dude! Oh Jesus!
"
9,8,Cartman,"Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!
"
9,8,Stan,"You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
"
9,8,Cartman,"I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
"
9,8,Stan,"What?
"
9,8,Cartman,"Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! 
"
9,8,Stan,"Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! 
"
9,8,Announcer,"With an eye on America and all of today's events, it's South Park Evening News, with Tom Pusslicker
"
9,8,Tom,"Herro, crisis and fear tonight, as what appears to be a massive flood has overtaken the town of Beaverton, Colorado, home of the world's largest beaver dam.  Earlier today, a break in the beaver dam which protected the town broke open, trapping people in their houses and destroying their lives. 
"
9,8,Sharon,"Oh my gosh, those poor people.
"
9,8,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm currently ten miles outside of Beaverton, unable to get inside the town proper. We do not have any reports of fatalities yet, but we believe that the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions. Beaverton has only a population of about eight thousand, Tom, so this would be quite devastating.
"
9,8,Tom,"Any word on how the survivors in the town are doing, Mitch? 
"
9,8,Mitch,"W-we're not sure what exactly is going on inside the town of Beaverton, uh Tom, but we're reporting that there's looting, raping, and yes, even acts of cannibalism.
"
9,8,Tom,"My God, you've, you've actually seen people looting, raping and eating each other?
"
9,8,Mitch,"No, no, we haven't actually seen it Tom, we're just reporting it.
"
9,8,Sharon,"You all done with your fishsticks, Stan?
"
9,8,Randy,"I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful.
"
9,8,Tom,"In the nearby town of South Park, the cause of the Beaverton flood is being investigated.
"
9,8,Man 1,"That's right! We know whose fault this is!
"
9,8,Stan,"Huh oh. 
"
9,8,Man 1,"It's George Bush's fault!
"
9,8,Man 2,"Yeah! George Bush doesn't care about beavers!
"
9,8,Man 3,"George Bush didn't break that beaver dam! It was terrorists and Al Qaeda!
"
9,8,Man 4,"They've been secretly building beaver dam WMDs for years now! 
"
9,8,Stan,"Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?
"
9,8,Sharon,"I don't know. You know, to me, it seems like the mayor of Beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago.
"
9,8,Randy,"Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault.
"
9,8,Stan,"Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?
"
9,8,Randy,"That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is. 
"
9,8,Stan,"Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?
"
9,8,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
9,8,Stan,"You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
"
9,8,Cartman,"Shyeah, that was pretty funny.
"
9,8,Stan,"Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!
"
9,8,Cartman,"Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!
"
9,8,Stan,"But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
"
9,8,Cartman,"Well they should've gotten out of there!
"
9,8,Stan,"Maybe they couldn't get out!
"
9,8,Cartman,"We did!
"
9,8,Stan,"Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!
"
9,8,Kyle,"Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
"
9,8,Stan,"Nothing
"
9,8,Cartman,"Hngh, totally.
"
9,8,Butters,"Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! 
"
9,8,Cartman,"Aw crap!
"
9,8,Mr. Mackey,"Quiet, children, quiet! We need to hear.
"
9,8,Tom,"At first, nobody knew what caused the dam to break, but now, shocking new evidence has indicated that the flood in Beaverton was caused by... global warming!  It now appears that... all rumors of global warming were true. We were warned this would happen and ...we didn't listen!  We didn't listen!  All the top Colorado geologists have gathered at the governor's office for an emergency meeting.
"
9,8,Randy,"Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen. 
"
9,8,Geologist 1,"Excuse me, sir, but, ...when? When is this going to happen?
"
9,8,Randy,"My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow. 
"
9,8,Geologist 2,"Excuse me, I'm sure we're all very impressed with your wild theories, Doctor uh, Marsh, but the fact is no statistical proof has ever been confirmed that global warming exists. Are you suggesting we shut down the economy?!
"
9,8,Randy,"With all due respect, clichй dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow. 
"
9,8,Scientist 1,"Listen! Listen! We've finished running the tests!
"
9,8,Scientist 2,"Global Warming is going to strike... two days before the day after tomorrow.
"
9,8,Randy,"Oh my God... That's today! 
"
9,8,Man 5,"We didn't listen!
"
9,8,Randy,"Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!
"
9,8,Man 6,"We didn't listen! 
"
9,8,Randy,"Come onnn, come on!
"
9,8,Sharon,"It's useless. This traffic isn't moving!
"
9,8,Stan,"Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.
"
9,8,Randy,"No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.
"
9,8,Driver,"We didn't listen!
"
9,8,Randy,"We, we didn't listen!  Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! 
"
9,8,Man 7,"Oh Jesus, here it comes!
"
9,8,Man 8,"Global warming! 
"
9,8,Man 9,"It's coming! Here comes global warming!
"
9,8,Man 10,"We didn't listen! 
"
9,8,Randy,"Come on, hurry! 
"
9,8,Man 11,"It's right behind us!  It's coming the other way! 
"
9,8,Randy,"Go back, go back!!
"
9,8,Stephen,"Everyone into the community center! Hurry! Go!
"
9,8,Randy,"Get inside! We have to close these doors! 
"
9,8,Randy,"Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.
"
9,8,Sheila,"Mr. Garrison, are you all right?
"
9,8,Mrs. Garrison,"I'm in pretty bad shape. My... leg is broken and my... left boob is leaking
"
9,8,Sharon,"Here you go, sweetheart.
"
9,8,Stan,"Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.
"
9,8,Sharon,"I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie. We have to try and save ourselves now.
"
9,8,Gerald,"Shh, shh! We've got the television working! 
"
9,8,Announcer,"This is a FOX News update! Global Warming Disaster!
"
9,8,Anchor,"Global warming appears to have struck as predicted in the Colorado Rockies! All around the country, panic and chaos are settling in!
"
9,8,Field Reporter,"Tom, I am standing just outside of Chicago, where the panic of global warming has already caused countless deaths. Already we're reporting that the death toll here in Chicago is over 600 billion people
"
9,8,Officer Barbrady,"Oh God.
"
9,8,Stephen,"This is all your fault, Jimbo!
"
9,8,Jimbo,"Me??
"
9,8,Stephen,"Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?!
"
9,8,Kyle,"Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.
"
9,8,Stan,"Kyle, it... it isn't global warming.
"
9,8,Kyle,"Huh?
"
9,8,Stan,"Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.
"
9,8,Kyle,"How do you know that?
"
9,8,Stan,"Because, I know what did cause the flood.
"
9,8,Kyle,"George Bush?
"
9,8,Stan,"No.
"
9,8,Kyle,"Terrorists?
"
9,8,Stan,"No.
"
9,8,Kyle,"Communists?
"
9,8,Stan,"No.
"
9,8,Kyle,"Chinese radicals?
"
9,8,Stan,"No.
"
9,8,Kyle,"...Cartman?
"
9,8,Stan,"...sort of.
"
9,8,Kyle,"Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!
"
9,8,Stan,"Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.
"
9,8,Kyle,"Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Hey Stan.  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!
"
9,8,Kyle,"Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!
"
9,8,Stan,"Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.
"
9,8,Kyle,"How?
"
9,8,Cartman,"Why?
"
9,8,Stan,"We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.
"
9,8,Randy,"Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!
"
9,8,Mrs. Garrison,"But... we need supplies, food, silicone.
"
9,8,Randy,"You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate,  bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero!
"
9,8,Stephen,"Jesus.
"
9,8,Randy,"All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.
"
9,8,Gerald,"And... the rest of the country?
"
9,8,Randy,"Everyone below this line  will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line  is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out.  The balmy southwestern states  might have a chance but, New York  will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast.  What, Frank?!  Aw awww, Goddammit! 
"
9,8,Resident 1,"Hello? Anybody? We'd like to be rescued, please. Any day now.
"
9,8,Resident 2,"Why haven't they come for us?
"
9,8,Resident 1,"I... I don't know.
"
9,8,Resident 3,"Wait, look! Here comes a boat!
"
9,8,Resident 2,"Really? Oh! It's about time!
"
9,8,Wife,"Oh Kevin, we're saved! 
"
9,8,Resident 3,"It looks like... three little boys.
"
9,8,Resident 1,"Hey, we'll take it!  Over here, yes! Thank you! Thank you!  Oh, thanks. Thanks. That's a LOT better.
"
9,8,Kyle,"We can't get out! The flames are too big!
"
9,8,Cartman,"Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle!  ""Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility.""
"
9,8,Kyle,"Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 
"
9,8,Randy,"Stan?? Stan!!
"
9,8,Gerald,"Randy! We've looked everywhere! Kyle's missing too!
"
9,8,Sharon,"Oh my God! Where would they go?!
"
9,8,Stephen,"Randy, Randy! Your son's on the phone!
"
9,8,Randy,"Stan??
"
9,8,Stan,"Uh, hey Dad.
"
9,8,Randy,"Stan, you're alive!
"
9,8,Stan,"Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!
"
9,8,Randy,"Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!
"
9,8,Stan,"No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something.
"
9,8,Randy,"What is it, son?
"
9,8,Stan,"Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?
"
9,8,Randy,"You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!! 
"
9,8,Mr. Mackey,"Randy, wheh-where are you going?
"
9,8,Randy,"I'm going to Beaverton.
"
9,8,Tom,"You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
"
9,8,Randy,"My son is counting on me!
"
9,8,Gerald,"I'm going with you.
"
9,8,Randy,"You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
"
9,8,Gerald,"You can't do this alone!
"
9,8,Stephen,"Let me go too.
"
9,8,Man 12,"You can't go out there. You'll freeze to death.
"
9,8,Randy,"All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find.
"
9,8,Gerald,"Stephen!  Stephen, you have to keep moving!
"
9,8,Stephen,"I can't go on! Feel so... hot.
"
9,8,Randy,"Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!
"
9,8,Gerald,"Oh Jesus...  I feel warm too!
"
9,8,Randy,"Yeah, me too.  Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing! 
"
9,8,Gerald,"Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!
"
9,8,Randy,"Don't be a fag!  Come on! We can make it!  We have to try!
"
9,8,General,"Come on, people, we're running out of time! We need all Army helicopters to the Southern states for evacuation NOW!
"
9,8,Officer,"Sir! More people in Beaverton are calling. They say they're trapped in floods and fire now.
"
9,8,General,"Tell them that the government can't help them, but that we're very sorry. You know the plan, people! We can only evacuate citizens below this line! 
"
9,8,Scientist,"E-excuse me, General?
"
9,8,General,"WHAT??
"
9,8,Scientist,"We've just compiled some new information. The er, the flood in Beaverton wasn't caused by global warming after all.
"
9,8,General,"What??
"
9,8,Scientist,"We know the truth now. We know what caused it! 
"
9,8,General,"Oh my God. Quick! Radio the helicopters!
"
9,8,Cartman,"Help! Help! 
"
9,8,Kyle,"Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!
"
9,8,Stan,"We have to find a way out! 
"
9,8,General,"Don't worry, everyone. The government is here to save you. 
"
9,8,Resident 1,"Oh wow, thank you so much! What a swift and speedy rescue!
"
9,8,Stan,"Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! 
"
9,8,Kyle,"Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!
"
9,8,Stan,"It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! 
"
9,8,Cartman,"Not so fast, Kyle.
"
9,8,Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
9,8,Cartman,"Hand over the gold!
"
9,8,Kyle,"What gold??
"
9,8,Cartman,"You know what I'm talkng about!
"
9,8,Kyle,"No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
"
9,8,Cartman,"All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!
"
9,8,Stan,"Guys, come on! 
"
9,8,Kyle,"Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
"
9,8,Cartman,"I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!
"
9,8,Kyle,"Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
"
9,8,Cartman,"Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!
"
9,8,Kyle,"Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!
"
9,8,Cartman,"I want... your Jew gold! 
"
9,8,Kyle,"...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go!
"
9,8,Cartman,"Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo! 
"
9,8,Cartman,"Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! 
"
9,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hey, look everybody! Helicopters! 
"
9,8,Sharon,"They, they've got the boys!
"
9,8,Tom,"Global warming must be over!
"
9,8,Man 13,"We made it! 
"
9,8,Sharon,"Stanley! 
"
9,8,Sheila,"Kyle! 
"
9,8,Randy,"Stan?  We've found Stan! Ugh. 
"
9,8,Mr. Mackey,"So does, does this mean the storm is past. Global warming's over?
"
9,8,General,"Global warming didn't cause the Beaverton flood. We know now whose fault it is.  It was...  Crab people!
"
9,8,Crowd,"Ohhhh.
"
9,8,Theme,"Crab People, Crab People, Taste like-
"
9,8,Stan,"Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. 
"
9,8,Cartman,"...Aw man.
"
9,8,Sharon,"Stanley. You?
"
9,8,Man 14,"No. Don't you see what this child is saying? We can't spend all our energy placing blame when something bad happens. He's saying... we all broke the dam. '
"
9,8,Stan,"No. I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Woman 1,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Man 15,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Man 16,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Stan,"No. I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Woman 2,"And I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Man 17,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.
"
9,8,Man 18,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Woman 3,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Stan,"I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.
"
9,8,Man 19,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Man 20,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Man 21,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Man 22,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Stan,"No! I broke the fucking dam!
"
9,8,Man 23,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Man 24,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Stan,"I literally broke the dam!
"
9,8,Man 25,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Man 26,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Stan,"On a boat! That wasn't mine!
"
9,8,Man 27,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Man 28,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Stan,"I kept it secret, for two days!
"
9,8,Man 29,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Man 30,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Stan,"The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!
"
9,8,Man 31,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Man 32,"I broke the dam.
"
9,8,Stan,"Ohhh, fuck it!
"
9,9,Kyle,"What are all you guys doing here?
"
9,9,Clyde,"I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement. 
"
9,9,Stan,"Yeah, us too.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.
"
9,9,Craig,"What?
"
9,9,Cartman,"What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.
"
9,9,Stan,"What?
"
9,9,Butters,"How do you know?
"
9,9,Kyle,"The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
"
9,9,Clyde,"YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS!  NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!
"
9,9,Cartman,"Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.
"
9,9,Butters,"Okay. I'm not lookin'. 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Video playback initialized. 
"
9,9,Bebe,"Okay, okay. My turn, do me now!
"
9,9,Kale,"Okay Bebe. What do you want to know?
"
9,9,Bebe,"I want to know if I'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future.
"
9,9,Kale,"Okay, let's find out. Ready?  Pick a number.
"
9,9,Bebe,"Four.
"
9,9,Kale,"One, two, three, four. Okay, pick a color.
"
9,9,Bebe,"Blue.
"
9,9,Kale,"B-L-U-E. All right pick another color
"
9,9,Bebe,"Red.
"
9,9,Kale,"'Kaaay. Okay, will Bebe live in a big mansion in the future?  Definitely yes!
"
9,9,Bebe,"All right!
"
9,9,Girls,"Woohoo! You rock, Bebe!
"
9,9,Boys,"Whoa! Wow!
"
9,9,Red,"Do me next. I wanna know if I'm gonna marry somebody cute.
"
9,9,Heidi,"I'll do it! I'll do it!  Pick a number.
"
9,9,Red,"Three.
"
9,9,Heidi,"One, two, three. Now, pick a color.
"
9,9,Clyde,"Where did they get that thing? 
"
9,9,Heidi,"G-R-E-E-N.
"
9,9,Red,"Now blue!
"
9,9,Heidi,"The answer is no. 
"
9,9,Red,"Aw dangit!
"
9,9,Stan,"Oh my God, how does it know the answer?
"
9,9,Craig,"I... don't believe it.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.
"
9,9,Cartman,"How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?
"
9,9,Clyde,"It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Good man. Any luck here?
"
9,9,Kyle,"The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.
"
9,9,Craig,"Let's go take it!
"
9,9,Cartman,"Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?
"
9,9,Stan,"So what do you suggest?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.
"
9,9,Stan,"Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.
"
9,9,Cartman,"No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.
"
9,9,Kevin,"You mean like that movie, Juwanna Mann?
"
9,9,Cartman,"No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!
"
9,9,Stan,"But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.
"
9,9,Kyle,"That's a pretty solid idea. But who?
"
9,9,Officer 1,"Mr. and Mrs. Stotch?
"
9,9,Stephen,"Yes? What is it, officer?
"
9,9,Officer 1,"You'd better come quick.
"
9,9,Officer 2,"Your son is at the Bowery Building threatening to kill himself.
"
9,9,Linda,"What?!
"
9,9,Officer 3,"Don't do it son! You have too much to live for! 
"
9,9,Linda,"Oh my God, Butters!
"
9,9,Butters,"Oh uh, hi Mom.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. 
"
9,9,Stephen,"Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks.
"
9,9,Butters,"N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. 
"
9,9,Linda,"He, h-he's coming down! Oh thank God!
"
9,9,Officer 1,"No, wait. What... what's he doing? 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Okay. One! Two! 
"
9,9,Officer 3,"JEESUS CHIRST! 
"
9,9,Linda,"OHHHH MY GOD!!
"
9,9,Doctor,"He... didn't make it.
"
9,9,Linda,"NOOOOO!! NOOOOO!! My son is DEAD!! NOOOO!!
"
9,9,Cartman,"Nice.
"
9,9,Priest Maxi,"And he shall be remembered as the peaceful little boy who warmed his parent's hearts.  Lord, as we commit this child's body to the earth, may we ask it'd be the last child you strike down so mercilessly. We know this request to be futile, Lord, but just though we would ask. 
"
9,9,Linda,"NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS!  Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!
"
9,9,Ms. Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Now I know that we're all still in deep, deep mourning over the tragic death of our classmate, Butters.
"
9,9,Red,"Who's Butters?
"
9,9,Ms. Garrison,"But we all must try to move on. And so I'd like you to help me welcome a new student who was just moved here from Dallas. Children please say hello to... Marjorine. 
"
9,9,Butters,"Oh... Thank you. 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. 
"
9,9,Ms. Garrison,"Why don't you tell the children a little bit about yourself, Marjorine?
"
9,9,Butters,"Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.
"
9,9,Clyde,"Nice.
"
9,9,Ms. Garrison,"Now Marjorine, that's not very ladylike. Us Colorado girls love to get pounded in the snootch just like any woman, but we keep it to ourselves.
"
9,9,Butters,"Oh...
"
9,9,Bebe,"That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Dude, they totally think he's a girl. 
"
9,9,Ms. Garrison,"All right, have a seat, Marjorine. I'm sure all the other girls will be happy to show you around the school.  Won't you, girls?
"
9,9,Red,"Where do you buy your clothes?
"
9,9,Butters,"Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. 
"
9,9,Mrs. Turner,"Heidi, sweetie, I'm just gonna set the snacks over here.
"
9,9,Heidi,"'Kay Mom.
"
9,9,Mrs. Turner,"Oh, and Heidi, there's going to be one extra girl coming to your slumber party.
"
9,9,Heidi,"Who?
"
9,9,Mrs. Turner,"The new girl in your class, Marjorine.
"
9,9,Heidi,"Mom, I didn't invite her!
"
9,9,Mrs. Turner,"I know, sweetie, but I got a call from Marjorine's mother.
"
9,9,Heidi,"Her mother?
"
9,9,Mrs. Turner,"She said Marjorine is having a really hard time being in a new school. Her mom asked me personally if we could have Marjorine over, and besides, her mother told me that she works as a state official and that I should  respect her authoratay.
"
9,9,Stephen,"Linda? Linda, please come downstairs.
"
9,9,Linda,"Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead? 
"
9,9,Stephen,"Oh butter! Oh Butters, I miss you so much! 
"
9,9,An old farmer,"Mr. Stotch. I know what you're thinkin'.
"
9,9,Stephen,"Who are you?
"
9,9,An old farmer,"I came to talk you out of it. You need to... just accept that your son is dead, not try to bring him back.
"
9,9,Stephen,"Bring him back? W-What are you talking about?
"
9,9,An old farmer,"I know you're thinkin' of puttin'; him up there, the Indian Burial Ground up that road. You're thinking if you bury his body there, he will come back alive. Sometimes, dead is better.
"
9,9,Stephen,"Indian... Burial Ground?
"
9,9,An old farmer,"It's been done before, what you're thinkin' of. The Nelson boy, back in '85.
"
9,9,Stephen,"You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury him at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I-
"
9,9,An old farmer,"Don't do it Stotch! What comes out of the ground ain't the thing you put in. The Indians knew that. That's why they stopped using it when the ground went sour. I'm just here to talk you out of it.  Don't bury your son's body at the Indian Burial Ground, Stotch! The one that's right up over there, behind Andersons' bar. Sometimes... dead is better. 
"
9,9,Stan,"All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.
"
9,9,Butters,"I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?
"
9,9,Clyde,"You're gonna be fine.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.
"
9,9,Butters,"Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?
"
9,9,Kyle,"Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
"
9,9,Butters,"Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
"
9,9,Stan,"Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.
"
9,9,Clyde,"Good luck, man. 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.
"
9,9,Mr. Turner,"All right, now we all want you to have a good time. but as Heidi's parents, tonight it is our responsibility to look out for all of you. There's not gonna be any drinking, no pot, and most importantly, if I catch any boys anywhere near this party, they're gonna be in a world of hurt.  All right, have a nice time, girls. 
"
9,9,Heidi,"So, what do you guys wanna do first?
"
9,9,Bebe,"We could play ""girl talk."" 
"
9,9,Red,"I bought the new Justin Timberlake CD. We should dance to it. 
"
9,9,Butters,"How about we read each other's future?
"
9,9,Wendy,"I know. Let's do ""Light as a feather, stiff as a board.""  Who wants to do it first?
"
9,9,Red,"I will. 
"
9,9,Butters,"Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? 
"
9,9,Wendy,"Light as a feather, stiff as a board.
"
9,9,Girls,"Light as a feather, stiff as a board! 
"
9,9,Kyle,"Jesus, what are they doing in there?
"
9,9,Cartman,"God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
"
9,9,Butters,"AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches! 
"
9,9,Heidi,"Marjorine, what is your problem?
"
9,9,Butters,"Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?
"
9,9,Red,"Yeah. I can tell your future, Marjorine! You're going to live alone your entire life because you're a nerdy, dorky geek.
"
9,9,Heidi,"Yeah, and your hair is totally stupid. 
"
9,9,Bebe,"Yeah, and you're flat! 
"
9,9,Heidi,"Marjorine, why don't you just leave? Nobody want you here!
"
9,9,Stephen,"Hello son. Don't you worry. Daddy's gonna make everything all right again.  There he is. There's my boy! Come on, Butters!  Oh... Butters... you smell like... bacon  Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son. We're gonna bring you back!
"
9,9,Wendy,"I think we went too far with Marjorine.
"
9,9,Bebe,"She's in the bathroom crying. 
"
9,9,Heidi,"Marjorine.
"
9,9,Butters,"Nobody likes meee...
"
9,9,Bebe,"Aw gee, she's really upset.
"
9,9,Wendy,"I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school.
"
9,9,Heidi,"Marjorine? Marjorine? Hey, we didn't mean it.
"
9,9,Butters,"You don't know how hard it is to be me. 
"
9,9,Bebe,"Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great.
"
9,9,Butters,"You think I'm ugly-ehehee...
"
9,9,Wendy,"You're not ugly, Marjorine.
"
9,9,Butters,"You said I'm ugly and flat.
"
9,9,Heidi,"Marjorine, you just have a different look, that's all. We just... we need to help you bring out your inner beauty.
"
9,9,Wendy,"Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine?
"
9,9,Girls,"Yeah. Let's go!
"
9,9,Butters,"You mean it?
"
9,9,Kyle,"Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong.
"
9,9,Stan,"Maybe they found him out.
"
9,9,Clyde,"Then, he's already dead.
"
9,9,Stan,"Come on, we gotta go check on him. 
"
9,9,Kyle,"Can you see anything? 
"
9,9,Stan,"He's just dancing around.
"
9,9,Cartman,"That son of a bitch!
"
9,9,Mrs. Turner,"Marjorine, sweetie your mom's on the phone.
"
9,9,Butters,"My mom?  Hello?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
9,9,Butters,"Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.
"
9,9,Cartman,"You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.
"
9,9,Butters,"Well, I'm workin' on it.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Working on what?! Your dance moves?!
"
9,9,Butters,"Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! 
"
9,9,Red,"Hey Marjorine, you wanna know your future?
"
9,9,Butters,"Ah. Uhh, could I hold that?
"
9,9,Heidi,"Sure.  Here, you do my future.
"
9,9,Butters,"How?
"
9,9,Heidi,"Well uh you know, it's easy. You just put your thumbs and index fingers in here...
"
9,9,Mr. Turner,"Aha! I knew it! Boys in the slumber party!
"
9,9,Heidi,"There's a boy here?
"
9,9,Butters,"Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! 
"
9,9,Craig,"He got it! He got the device! 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! 
"
9,9,Stan,"Come on, Butters.
"
9,9,Butters,"No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! 
"
9,9,Heidi,"What the hell?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! 
"
9,9,Heidi,"...Anybody have a piece of notebook paper so I can make another one?
"
9,9,Jason,"Go! Go! Get in the containment field! 
"
9,9,Linda,"Stephen, you did what??
"
9,9,Stephen,"I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest chance it would bring him back! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anymore!
"
9,9,Linda,"You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?
"
9,9,Stephen,"Linda, I did it for you, you wanted him back so much! So did I!
"
9,9,Linda,"Not like this!  Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn! 
"
9,9,Butters,"Hello?
"
9,9,Stephen,"It's him.
"
9,9,Linda,"Keep the door locked.
"
9,9,Butters,"Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. 
"
9,9,Linda,"Oh God...  No! 
"
9,9,Stephen,"It's gone, dear. It's gone. Forgive me.
"
9,9,Butters,"Hey Mom and Dad, I'm not- 
"
9,9,Stephen,"Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?!
"
9,9,Butters,"Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.
"
9,9,Linda,"It isn't right! Make it go away!
"
9,9,Cartman,"Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. 
"
9,9,Stan,"Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
"
9,9,Cartman,"No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.
"
9,9,Clyde,"How come you get to use it first?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Because I do, Clyde.
"
9,9,Craig,"I wanna use it.
"
9,9,Cartman,"I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?
"
9,9,Kyle,"Wait! I don't wanna know that!
"
9,9,Clyde,"Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.
"
9,9,Jason,"Nah dude, then it won't be fun tow watch.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Will you all shut up so I can do this!?
"
9,9,Craig,"You shut up, asshole.
"
9,9,Kyle,"I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 
"
9,9,Stan,"Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.
"
9,9,Jason,"How could be nothing but trouble?
"
9,9,Stan,"We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
"
9,9,Clyde,"Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure.
"
9,9,Craig,"Maybe we should take it so someplace safer.
"
9,9,Stan,"And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.
"
9,9,Bradley,"You mean destroy it?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?
"
9,9,Stan,"We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Think of the power!
"
9,9,Kyle,"It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.
"
9,9,Stan,"Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Damn, Ken.
"
9,9,Stephen,"Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son. 
"
9,9,Butters,"Hi Dad.
"
9,9,Linda,"He was supposed to stay dead!
"
9,9,Butters,"Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?
"
9,9,Stephen,"Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. You're an abomination.
"
9,9,Butters,"Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.
"
9,9,Linda,"It's... hungry.
"
9,9,Stephen,"Yes, it must feed.
"
9,9,Rachel,"Hello, I'm Rachel with Quality Curtains.
"
9,9,Stephen,"Oh yes, thank you for coming.
"
9,9,Rachel,"Which room are we looking at?
"
9,9,Stephen,"Just follow me to the basement.
"
9,9,Linda,"Yes. The basement.
"
9,9,Rachel,"Oh my, it's pretty dark down here. You sure you need curtains?  Oh my God!
"
9,9,Butters,"Uh hello, I'm Butters.
"
9,9,Rachel,"Little boy, what are you doing here? 
"
9,9,Butters,"Huh?
"
9,9,Stephen,"Here you go, son. Eat!
"
9,9,Linda,"What are we becoming?!
"
9,9,Stephen,"Come on. Don't watch it eat. 
"
9,9,Butters,"Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, children, this week we are all going to learn about parenting.  I'm going to pair all the boys and girls in class into couples, and give each couple...  an egg. You must care for and look after this egg just like a baby for one full week. If you break your egg, it means you have a dead baby, and if you kill your baby, you get an F. When I announce your names, please move and sit with the person you're paired with.  Heidi, you'll be with Eric.
"
9,10,Heidi,"Awww!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Annie, you'll be a family with Timmy.
"
9,10,Timmy,"Timmiih!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Millie, your husband is Craig. Powder, you and Kenny are a loving couple now.
"
9,10,Stan,"Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.
"
9,10,Kenny,"(So?)
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Aaand let's see who else we have here, uh...
"
9,10,Stan,"So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"And, Wendy? Wendy will be with Kyle.
"
9,10,Stan,"Kyle??
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Bebe, you're paired up with Stan. Lola and Token, Red and Craig, and Esther and Bradley.  Now, I'm going to sign each of your eggs myself, so that we'll know it's the same one at the end of the week. That way if anybody cheats and tries to replace their eggs, we'll know, Eric.  All you have to do is make it to Friday with your egg unharmed to prove what great little parents you are.  Okay children, you can now take the rest of the school period to decorate your egg however you wish. Good luck, and remember, a dead baby means an F for the parents. 
Just look at all these little families
Newfound couples in a happy home.
It takes me back to another time
When I had a love of my own. 
Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now.
Love, so darn frail, you know? It shriveled and died. I don't know how.
Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now.
Guess that I'll never know how it all went wrong. How how how? 
Well perhaps I should try and boldly go and rekindle that love lost long ago.
Hello, Mr. Slave. 
"
9,10,Mr. Slave,"Mr. Garrison! Ohoh, Jezuth!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Just let me say what I came here to say. I know we had a falling out and... things were said that... shouldn't have been said. I want to apologize for calling you a faggot.
"
9,10,Mr. Slave,"That's, that's wonderful, Mr. Garrison!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Well, wait, wait, it gets better. I've forgiven you for walking out on me after I had my sex change, and uh...  And I'm ready to take you back, Mr. Slave!
"
9,10,Mr. Slave,"Ooooo...
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Well, give us a kiss!
"
9,10,Big Gay Al,"Say, honey, is that the pizza? 
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"What the hell is he doing here?!
"
9,10,Mr. Slave,"Mr. Garrison, Al and I have been living together for a few months.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Well, that didn't take you long, did it?!
"
9,10,Big Gay Al,"Slave, should I leave you two alone?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Yes!
"
9,10,Mr. Slave,"No!  Mr. Garrison, there's something you should know. Al and I are getting married.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Married?!
"
9,10,Big Gay Al,"Yes.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"You can't get married! You're faggots!
"
9,10,Mr. Slave,"Oh, Jesus Christ.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Mr. Slave, I am legally a woman now! If you wanna get married, you have to marry ME!
"
9,10,Big Gay Al,"Oh that's not true! Colorado is about to pass a bill which allows same-sex marriage.
"
9,10,Mr. Slave,"We're getting married right after the bill passes on Saturday.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Oh, that's just great! They're gonna let queers and homos get married, huh?!
"
9,10,Mr. Slave,"Okay, that's enough. Out, Mr. Garrison.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"We'll just see about this, you fudge-packin' fags!! I'll stop that gay-marriage law! 
"
9,10,Mr. Slave,"Oh my God, you're just saying that because you're jealous.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Jealous of what?! I'm doin' this out of principle! To protect the sanctity of marriage!  Fags are gettin' married over MY DEAD BODY!! 
"
9,10,Kyle,"Hello? Oh hey dude.
"
9,10,Stan,"So, what are you and Wendy doing?
"
9,10,Kyle,"Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.
"
9,10,Stan,"Uh huh...
"
9,10,Kyle,"I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
"
9,10,Stan,"Yeah, well, so is your hat. 
"
9,10,Bebe,"Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while.
"
9,10,Stan,"I can't. I'm busy.
"
9,10,Bebe,"I've been looking after it all day. I have to go to the hair salon and the candy store!
"
9,10,Stan,"...So take it with you!
"
9,10,Bebe,"Stan, this is our egg. We're both supposed to take care of it.
"
9,10,Stan,"Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!
"
9,10,Bebe,"Well whether you wanted to or not doesn't really matter now! We're going to get graded together! It's your egg too! Own up to your responsibilities! 
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"These homosexuals think they can just step all over our traditions! Well I say: Marriage is a holy sacrament between a man and a woman! 
"
9,10,Woman,"Who is that lady?
"
9,10,Man,"I don't know, but she is pissed.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"They passed this law behind our back! We need to tell the governor and the world that gay marriage is not okay! That homosexuals cannot muddy our traditions! And there is only one way for us, all together, to make that message very clear! We need to round up three or four queers and beat the livin' hell out of them!  Come on, everybody! Let's get some queers, and some trucks, and have us a good old-fashioned fag drag!
"
9,10,Man 2,"Well uh, we were thinkin' we would, you know, just go appeal to the Governor.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Appeal to the Governor? Oh,come on! Where's your balls?! Fag drag!
"
9,10,Man 3,"We don't ""hate"" homosexuals, we, we we just don't want them to be able to marry.
"
9,10,Man 4,"Yeah, we were just thinkin' o' goin' and askin' the Governor to veto the bill.
"
9,10,Man 5,"Yeah.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Eh fah, fag drag?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Governor, we have collected over one thousand signatures requesting that you veto this gay-marriage bill!
"
9,10,Governor,"Oh jeez, I knew this would happen. First the gay people come in here wanting equal rights, then this bill gets passed and now all the people against it want me to veto it. &gt; Why do I have to make this decision?? /&gt;
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Because you're the governor?
"
9,10,Governor,"I just wanted a big house and lots of respect. I didn't want this kind of responsibility.  I mean, I don't know anything about gay marriage. What argument can I use to deny them their right to a family?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Well, think of the children! If you allow gays to get married, then you're also givin' them full rights as parents to adopt. You think kids can be raised by queers??
"
9,10,Governor,"I can't use that argument. There's never been a study done which proves that either way.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"But, if you had such a study, a scientific study which proved same-sex couples are incapable of raising a child...
"
9,10,Governor,"Then I would have something to fall back on. So-something to take all the pressure off of me.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Mr. Governor, I will get you that study.
"
9,10,Bebe,"Hey Wendy, how's your egg doing?
"
9,10,Wendy,"Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg. 
"
9,10,Bebe,"Yeah.  I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, students, change of plan!  You've all been doing a great job taking care of your eggs, but now we're going to mix it up a little. Wendy and Kyle will no longer be together.
"
9,10,Stan,"HA!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Let's see what happens when we put two same-sex couples together to take care of an egg, shall we?! Kyle, you are now with Stan! And Wendy is with Bebe! 
"
9,10,Kyle,"Why?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Come on, Bebe. We'll take your egg for you and Wendy to look after.
"
9,10,Bebe,"Oh, goodie. 
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"And we'll just take this egg for Stan and Kyle to look out for. 
"
9,10,Wendy,"No. No, that's my egg.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Wendy, we're doing an experiment.  Here you go, boys. 
"
9,10,Wendy,"But I made that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Hoh now, what makes you say that, Wendy? I'm sure two boys can handle an egg just fine...  And if not, we'll certainly prove a point to that goddamned Governor, won't we?
"
9,10,Kyle,"Who?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Never mind, just carry on, children. Just carry on as two reckless little boys will.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.
"
9,10,Stan,"Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?
"
9,10,Stan,"Why do you say that?
"
9,10,Kyle,"It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.
"
9,10,Stan,"That's because I was pissed off!
"
9,10,Kyle,"At who?  Heh- hang on. 
"
9,10,Wendy,"I wanna see my egg.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Huh?
"
9,10,Wendy,"I want to see my egg.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!
"
9,10,Wendy,"Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!
"
9,10,Wendy,"...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;
"
9,10,Wendy,"Don't let anything happen to it, please. 
"
9,10,Kyle,"Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man.
"
9,10,Stan,"You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! 
"
9,10,Kyle,"What the hell is wrong with everybody?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, children, it's Wednesday! Time for an official egg check! Heidi and Eric?
"
9,10,Heidi,"Our egg is fine.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, Annie and Timmy?
"
9,10,Timmy,"TimmiIH!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Good. Millie and Clyde, I saw yours before class.  Powder and Kenny?
"
9,10,Kenny,"(Our egg is okay.)
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Now how about our gay couples? Stan and Kyle?
"
9,10,Stan,"Fine!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"What?
"
9,10,Stan,"No problems at all!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"That's impossible!  Are you sure you didn't break it and switch eggs on me?! Where's my signature?!
"
9,10,Stan,"It's right there, see? 
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Two boys can't possibly take care of an egg!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Dude, it's totally fine.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"It isn't fine! It has two daddies! You call that fine?! It may be fine on the outside, but inside it's confused and embarrassed! Look at the freak egg! It has two daddies!  Two daddies! Two daddies! Come on, class, let's rip on the freak egg! Two daddies! Two daddies!
"
9,10,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the Governor's office, where in just two days, the Governor can either sign or veto the new bill allowing gay marriage. Same-sex couples from all over the state have shown up in support,  while dissenters have also converged. The governor is about to give a statement.
"
9,10,Governor,"I believe that I might have come up with a compromise to this whole problem that will make everyone happy! People in the gay community want the same rights as married couples, but dissenters don't want the word ""marriage"" corrupted. So how about we let gay people get married, but call it something else?  You homosexuals will have all exactly the same rights as married couples, but instead of referring to you as ""married,"" you can be... butt buddies.  Instead of being ""man and wife,"" you'll be... butt buddies. You won't be ""betrothed,"" you'll be... butt buddies. Get it? Instead of a ""bride and groom,"" you'd be... butt buddies.
"
9,10,Mr. Slave,"We wanna be treated equally!
"
9,10,Governor,"Y-you are equal. It's just that instead of getting ""engaged,"" you would be... butt buuuddies. And everyone is happy!
"
9,10,Woman,"Well what about lesbians?!
"
9,10,Governor,"Well like anyone cares about fuckin' dykes.  Oh, God, I was sure that would work.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Damnit, damnit! Stan and Kyle's egg is still doin' fine! Those little assholes are screwin' up my entire plan!  Yes, what?!  What the hell is this?!
"
9,10,Cartman,"I broke the egg.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"You broke your egg?? Uh but you're partnered with a girl.
"
9,10,Cartman,"I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Did you tell anyone else about this?
"
9,10,Cartman,"...No.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Did you tell your egg partner, Heidi?
"
9,10,Cartman,"No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"I can't do that, Eric!
"
9,10,Cartman,"Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"You have to get an A, Eric. Here: I'll sign this new egg for you. We'll pretend this never happened, all right?  Just... put on the old hair, color in the same eyes... There we go, good as new.  Go enjoy the rest of your recess.
"
9,10,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"...Okay, well, you're welcome, Eric. Now, just run along. 
"
9,10,Cartman,"...Why are you doing this?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Because I'm a nice teacher, all right?
"
9,10,Cartman,"What do you want from me?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Nothing! It's all okay! Just take your damn egg!
"
9,10,Cartman,"...No.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Eric, you've never been anything but a problem for me! You're taking that egg! And if you break it again, I'll break both your legs, and burn down your house! Do you hear me?!
"
9,10,Cartman,"Yes teacher.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Get out of my face!  Urrgh, this scientific study isn't turning out the way I planned! Looks like I'm gonna have to... intervene.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Are you Jakartha?
"
9,10,Jakartha,"Who the hell are you?!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Mrs. Garrison. I spoke to your associates on the telephone.
"
9,10,Jakartha,"Ahh yes, you are interested in my services.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"I have a little... problem I need taken care of. I heard you're the best.
"
9,10,Jakartha,"Who do you want me to kill?  What is this?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"It's an egg.
"
9,10,Jakartha,"You want me to kill an egg?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"I can pay two thousand now, three more when the job is finished.
"
9,10,Jakartha,"What do you expect me to do with it?
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"I don't care. Scramble it, fry it, do what you will! It has to look like an accident.
"
9,10,Jakartha,"I am a serious assassin! Get out of my face!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"What's the matter? You... afraid you can't do it? Can't say that I blame ya. That egg has caused me nothin' but problems since day one!  I guess... you're not as good as they say you are...
"
9,10,Jakartha,"I am the greatest killer the world has ever seen!!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Then why are you scared of one little egg?!
"
9,10,Jakartha,"I will murder that egg! Then I will make it curse the day it was laid!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"That's more like it!
"
9,10,Stan,"Day five. I made it!  Hello?
"
9,10,Kyle,"Dude, did you hear what's happening?
"
9,10,Stan,"What?
"
9,10,Kyle,"Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
"
9,10,Stan,"Governor's office?
"
9,10,Kyle,"She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?
"
9,10,Stan,"Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
"
9,10,Stan,"What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Impress Wendy??
"
9,10,Stan,"You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!
"
9,10,Kyle,"What the hell are you talking about?!
"
9,10,Stan,"Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say ""See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is."" 
"
9,10,Jakartha,"Almost too easy. 
"
9,10,Stan,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Stan?
"
9,10,Stan,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Stan? Stan, I think we should talk.
"
9,10,Stan,"Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
"
9,10,Stan,"Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.
"
9,10,Kyle,"I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
"
9,10,Stan,"I don't. She's totally lame. 
"
9,10,Kyle,"Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
"
9,10,Stan,"I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
"
9,10,Stan,"Huh?
"
9,10,Kyle,"It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.
"
9,10,Stan,"That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?
"
9,10,Kyle,"Yeah dude. I'm sorry.
"
9,10,Stan,"Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Yeah. And I can still get my A!
"
9,10,Stan,"Come on, buddy, let's go! 
"
9,10,Kyle,"Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?
"
9,10,Stan,"As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on! 
"
9,10,Governor,"Today is a very big day in which I'm supposed to make a very big decision. As some of you know, my biggest issue with gay marriage regards child-rearing. And a new study has just been concluded which will give me the ability to take no personal responsibility in this decision.
"
9,10,Big Gay Al,"A new study?
"
9,10,Governor,"Here with the results of that study is the lovely Mrs. Garrison. 
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Thank you, Governor.
"
9,10,Mr. Slave,"Oh, Jesus Christ.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Ladies and Gentlemen, with the help of some adorable fourth-grade students, we've completed our scientific, non-biased study of fags having kids. Come on up, children.  The parents were grouped together as male and female. As you can see...
"
9,10,Aide,"Uh, Mrs. Garrison. You have an emergency phone call.
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Yes, what is it?! I'm a little busy!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"What?? Y-your... you're too late!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Don't fail us! We'll be right there!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"No you can'- Hello? Hello!!  You told me you killed that freak egg!!
"
9,10,Jakartha,"I was sure I did!
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Well it's here! You'd better make damn sure it doesn't reach these steps uncracked!  Haha, anyhow, as I was saying, we put one egg into the hands of two male students. 
"
9,10,Kyle,"Thanks dude! 
"
9,10,Stan,"There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!
"
9,10,Jakartha,"Yeeeeaah! 
"
9,10,Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Keep running! 
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"The the egg that the two boys were given just-
"
9,10,Kyle,"Hang on! Wait! 
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"In conclusion, Governor, you can rest assured that-! 
"
9,10,Stan,"Teacher, our egg is... okay. 
"
9,10,Governor,"This egg is fine.  Gays can get married! 
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Noo! Noooo!!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Gays can get married? What??
"
9,10,Fr. Maxi,"I now pronounce you man... and man. 
"
9,10,Randy,"Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights. 
"
9,10,Kyle,"What did we do?
"
9,10,Wendy,"Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad.
"
9,10,Stan,"Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. 
"
9,10,Mrs. Garrison,"Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now.
Guess that I'll never know how it all went wrong. How how how?
Well perhaps I should try and boldly go and rekindle that love lost long ago.
"
9,11,Token,"Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you. 
"
9,11,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, very nice, Token. Thank you. 'K kids, looks like we only have time for one more speech today, so let's have ah Eric.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled ""Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles.""  We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.
"
9,11,Kyle,"What?!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  vampires.
"
9,11,Class,"Aaaah.
"
9,11,Kyle,"That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!
"
9,11,Cartman,"I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called ""daywalkers."" 
"
9,11,Butters,"Ho! Daywalkers!
"
9,11,Kyle,"This is all a bunch of crap!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...
"
9,11,Mrs. Garrison,"Kyle, let Eric give his presentation.
"
9,11,Kyle,"It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
"
9,11,Clyde,"I am.
"
9,11,Mrs. Garrison,"Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with your paper tomorrow!
"
9,11,Kyle,"Fine, I will! 
"
9,11,Cartman,"Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again. 
"
9,11,Kyle,"Stupid supremacist asswipe!
"
9,11,Stan,"Dude, what's the big deal?
"
9,11,Kyle,"What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
"
9,11,Stan,"What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
"
9,11,Three kids,"Hello?
"
9,11,Kyle,"Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
"
9,11,Girl,"Sure. Come on in. 
"
9,11,Boy,"Mom, Dad, these boys wanna know about us.
"
9,11,Father,"What? Heh, hello there, kids.
"
9,11,Kyle,"We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
"
9,11,Father,"Oho, gingers, yes. Our cute little red-haired rascals.
"
9,11,Stan,"I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.
"
9,11,Father,"Yes, we've learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families' DNA. Actually, the odds of us having a red-haired freckled child were only one in four. And still it happened. Three times. What are the odds? 
"
9,11,Mother,"A lot of people carry the ginger gene and don't know.  If your spouse is also a carrier, then your children can turn out like... them. 
"
9,11,Father,"Each one of them's a blessing.
"
9,11,Mother,"Oh yes, each one of them's a blessing.
"
9,11,Father,"Huh Blesse-blessing full of love.
"
9,11,Three kids,"Thanks, Mom and Dad.
"
9,11,Kyle,"But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 
"
9,11,Father,"No... no, I'm sure they do.  Well it was nice meeting you boys. We've gotta get dinner started.
"
9,11,Kyle,"I just had a couple more questions about-
"
9,11,Father,"Look, boys, if you really don't wanna have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene.  I know a guy who's marrying a Japanese woman very soon for just that reason. 
"
9,11,Kyle,"And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 
"
9,11,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, very nice, Kyle. A little dry and science-y for my taste, but there you go.  All right, that's lunch, kids. We'll pick up with Clyde's speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess.
"
9,11,Butters,"That was a very informative speech, Kyle.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Thanks Butters
"
9,11,Cartman,"Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! 
"
9,11,Stan,"You buying school lunch today?
"
9,11,Kyle,"Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
"
9,11,Clyde,"Right this way!  You can't eat in the cafeteria! 
"
9,11,Boy,"How come?
"
9,11,Token,"Ginger kids eat in the hallway!
"
9,11,Jimmy,"Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard! 
"
9,11,Kyle,"There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
"
9,11,Stan,"That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Hey.  That's a great idea!
"
9,11,Kenny,"(What's a great idea?)
"
9,11,Kyle,"Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
"
9,11,Stan,"Sure, for what?
"
9,11,Kyle,"We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
"
9,11,Stan,"Okay dude, knock him out.  Dude, dude okay, he's out!  Kyle, that's good!  All right, let's do it.
"
9,11,Liane,"Eric honey, time to get up for school. 
"
9,11,Cartman,"-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-
"
9,11,Liane,"Poopsiekins!  Sweetie, what is the-  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
9,11,Cartman,"I'M GINGER!
"
9,11,Liane,"Oh my God! Eric!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Help me! Hellp mee!
"
9,11,Doctor,"Well, all his vital signs are still normal. From his outward appearance, I would say he has the standard skin pigment deficiency.
"
9,11,Liane,"You mean...
"
9,11,Doctor,"Yes, I'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus.
"
9,11,Cartman,"And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
"
9,11,Doctor,"Well, the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene. It must've stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence.
"
9,11,Cartman,"So I'm gonna stay like this forever?
"
9,11,Doctor,"I'm sorry, son.  Ms. Cartman, could I have a word with you?  Ms. Cartman, I know this must be... very difficult for you. I for one can't stand red-haired, freckled kids, but you need to understand, there is no cure. Your son will be ginger his whole life. You might want to just... put him down.
"
9,11,Liane,"Oh... 
"
9,11,Cartman,"Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!  Right, Mom?!  Mom?!
"
9,11,Liane,"Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie.
"
9,11,Doctor,"All right, but... you're gonna have to take certain precautions now. It's very important that you keep Eric out of the sun. The sun... is his worst enemy.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Hey dudes, what's goin' on?  How is everything with you guys?
"
9,11,Kyle,"Wow, Cartman. You look... different.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.
"
9,11,Stan,"You mean,you're a ginger?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Is that an umbrella you're using?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Yes, Kyle.  The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.
"
9,11,Kyle,"...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?
"
9,11,Cartman,"What do you mean, Kyle?
"
9,11,Kyle,"Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. 
"
9,11,Cartman,"That's fine, just get it out of the way...
"
9,11,Kyle,"Dude, this is going awesome.
"
9,11,Stan,"Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. 
"
9,11,Cartman,"Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? 
"
9,11,Token,"What are you doing?
"
9,11,Cartman,"I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?
"
9,11,Clyde,"You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Huh?
"
9,11,Craig,"You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.
"
9,11,Cartman,"But... it's me.
"
9,11,Clyde,"Right. And you're a ginger. 
"
9,11,Kyle,"Dude, check it out. 
"
9,11,Cartman,"Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. 
"
9,11,Clyde,"Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.
"
9,11,Jimmy,"Yeah, beat it, j... jackass. 
"
9,11,Kyle,"We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
"
9,11,Cartman,"I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!
"
9,11,Boy,"Yeah!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us ""genetically inferior."" The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!
"
9,11,Older Boy,"My dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel.
"
9,11,Cartman,"...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like...  Like uh...  Liiike...
"
9,11,Girl,"Ron Howard?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...
"
9,11,Older Boy,"Ron Howard? 
"
9,11,Cartman,"Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!
"
9,11,Kids,"Yeah!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power! 
"
9,11,Gingers,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Cartman,"We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Yeah!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Kyle,"I don't believe it.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Stan,"Should we tell him the truth?
"
9,11,Gingers,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Kyle,"Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Better red than dead!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Better red than dead!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Better red than dead!
"
9,11,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the Denver Center For The Performing Arts, where the new production of ""Annie"" has just premiered to cries of outrage.  A rapidly-growing organization called The Ginger Separatist Movement is furious that the lead role of Annie  is being played by a girl  who isn't actually red-haired and freckled. Joining me now is the gingers' head spokesperson, Eric Cartman.
"
9,11,Cartman,"That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
"
9,11,Reporter,"What harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true red-haired community?
"
9,11,Cartman,"The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Yeah! That's right! 
"
9,11,Cartman,"There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!
"
9,11,Reporter,"This is getting pretty ugly, Tom. These gingers are really riled up! If you are a ginger and would like to join The Ginger Separatist Movement, you can attend their first meeting this Friday in the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
"
9,11,Older Boy,"Okay, welcome, everyone. It's so great to see such a wonderful turnout at the first All-Ginger Pride Conference!  Now it is my honor to introduce the man who has brought self-respect to gingers, Eric Cartman!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'?  Can I get a Red Power?
"
9,11,Gingers,"Red Power!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Yeah!!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! 
"
9,11,Gary Nelson,"Hello there! Gary Nelson with Hilton Guest Relations. Just making sure you guys have everything you need. 
"
9,11,Cartman,"We're fine, thanks.
"
9,11,Gary Nelson,"Need any buffet items restocked? Everyone okay on coffee?
"
9,11,Cartman,"We're fine!
"
9,11,Gary Nelson,"Great. Oh, and hey guys, just wanted to say thanks for choosing the Airport Hilton for your conference.
"
9,11,Cartman,"You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!
"
9,11,Ginger 1,"Huh
"
9,11,Ginger 2,"What
"
9,11,Ginger 3,"Ex-terminate?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Wirha! atta!
"
9,11,Kyle,"Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
"
9,11,Stan,"Huh? Why?
"
9,11,Kyle,"Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
"
9,11,Kenny,"(Hehe, yeah. Hehe)
"
9,11,Kyle,"Are you in?
"
9,11,Stan,"... totally.
"
9,11,Stan,"You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.
"
9,11,Kenny,"(Hehe, yeah, heh) 
"
9,11,Kyle,"Oh... hey there. 
"
9,11,Stan,"You guys... need... anything? 
"
9,11,Kyle,"Let's just... let's just walk this way. 
"
9,11,Stan,"More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Yeah, good idea. 
"
9,11,Stan,"The hell do they want? 
"
9,11,Kenny,"(AH!)
"
9,11,Kyle,"Kenny!
"
9,11,Stan,"Run, dude, run!!
"
9,11,Clyde,"Uh... Gi... ginger kids! AAAAAH! 
"
9,11,Mom,"Clyde? What is it, honey? 
"
9,11,Boy,"Aaah!  Ginger kids! Nooo! 
"
9,11,Ginger Girl,"Laaa la, laaa lala.
"
9,11,Girl,"What is it?
"
9,11,Ginger Girl,"laaa lala.
"
9,11,Boy,"It's a... little ginger girl.
"
9,11,Ginger Girl,"laaa la.
"
9,11,Girl,"Shut the door!
"
9,11,Ginger Girl,"Laaa la, laaa lala, laaa la.
"
9,11,Kids,"AAAAAH! 
"
9,11,Boy,"Ow!
"
9,11,Ginger Girl,"Laaa la, laaa lala.
"
9,11,Kyle,"In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 
"
9,11,Stan,"Kyle. Kyle, wake up.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we? 
"
9,11,Stan,"I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
"
9,11,Cartman,"My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! 
"
9,11,Stan,"Cartman?
"
9,11,Kyle,"Oh Jesus, I should have known!
"
9,11,Cartman,"What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! 
"
9,11,Gary Nelson,"You guys got everything you need in here? Need more coffee, buffet items?
"
9,11,Cartman,"No, we're fine! Thank you!
"
9,11,Gary Nelson,"How about lava? You got enough lava?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Yes! We're good!
"
9,11,Gary Nelson,"Okay. Hey, thanks for choosin' the Airport Hilton, guys.
"
9,11,Cartman,"You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We will start... with the daywalker!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Daywalker!  Throw him in!
"
9,11,Kyle,"Cartman! I need to tell you something!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Go on then! Say your last words!
"
9,11,Kyle,"Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Okay fine, let him speak!  Then we kill every non-ginger here!  You... you what? 
"
9,11,Ginger Boy,"Come on, let's fulfill the plan! All non-gingers must die!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Yeah!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become?
"
9,11,Gingers,"Huh? What?
"
9,11,Cartman,"D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.
"
9,11,Ginger Boy 2,"But... you just said everyone who isn't ginger must die.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.
"
9,11,Ginger Boy 2,"But you just said they should all die fifteen seconds ago.
"
9,11,Cartman,"See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. 
"
9,11,Ginger Boy,"What did that kid in the green hat tell you?
"
9,11,Cartman,"... Huh?
"
9,11,Ginger Boy,"That kid right there. What did he just tell you?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.
"
9,11,Ginger Boy,"You wanted to kill everyone who wasn't ginger, then that kid in the green hat told you something, and now you don't wanna do it all of a sudden. What did he tell you?
"
9,11,Cartman,"No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together.
"
9,11,Gingers,"Ginger or not, it's all the same.
"
9,11,Cartman,"That's it! You've got it!
"
9,11,Cartman and the Gingers,"Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame. 
Hand in hand, we can live together.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Live together!
"
9,11,Gingers,"We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
"
9,11,Cartman,"The same, you and I!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.
"
9,11,Kyle,"You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Yes, but I'm not going to die.  That's why we gotta get along, people!
"
9,11,Gingers,"Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
"
9,11,Gingers,"Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.
Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame.
Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
"
9,12,Kyle,"Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
"
9,12,Cartman,"Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!
"
9,12,Kyle,"How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
"
9,12,Stan,"I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.
"
9,12,Cartman,"HA! Saving money, duhhh! 
"
9,12,Kyle,"So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
"
9,12,Cartman,"Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.
"
9,12,Kenny,"(Hey yeah!)
"
9,12,Stan,"No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.
"
9,12,Cartman,"Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.
"
9,12,Kyle,"Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.
"
9,12,Stan,"Well I can't spend any money.
"
9,12,Cartman,"Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. 
"
9,12,Kyle,"Yeah. See ya. 
"
9,12,Woman,"Hello, would you like to take a personality test? It's fun and it's free.
"
9,12,Stan,"Excuse me?
"
9,12,Woman,"We're doing free personality tests today.
"
9,12,Stan,"Uh what do I have to do?
"
9,12,Woman,"Have you heard of Scientology? It's all based on the book, Dianetics. A lot of really cool people are Scientologist's, like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Why don't you come on in and we'll get your fun free personality test started.  Let's just find an empty room here, lots of people getting free tests today.  Hey Brian.
"
9,12,Brian,"Hey Kelly. How's it going?
"
9,12,Kelly,"Great! I want you to meet my new friend, Stan.
"
9,12,Brian,"Hey there! How are you?
"
9,12,Stan,"Fine.
"
9,12,Kelly,"Brian's gonna give you your personality test and then let you know some things about Scientology.
"
9,12,Brian,"Good times, good times!
"
9,12,Stan,"L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.
"
9,12,Brian,"Ho, that's not a problem at all. Scientology is more like an alternative to psychology than a religion.
"
9,12,Stan,"Then how come that sign says ""Church of Scientology""?
"
9,12,Brian,"Oho, that's just this thing: What's the Denver Broncos' record now? Six and two?
"
9,12,Stan,"Seven and two.
"
9,12,Brian,"Wow! That's great! All right, come on in and take a seat; we're gonna have some fun!  All right now, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. Just answer these questions as truthfully as you can, alright?  Okay. Number 1: Do you ever make remarks... which you later regret?
"
9,12,Stan,"Uhhh, sh-sure?
"
9,12,Brian,"Uh huh. Would you rather give orders... than take them?
"
9,12,Stan,"Yeah?
"
9,12,Brian,"Do you ever whistle... just for the fun of it.  Okay, and finally, does life sometimes feel vague and confusing to you?
"
9,12,Stan,"Yes.
"
9,12,Brian,"Okay, Stan. Well, that's it. That's the end of the personality test.
"
9,12,Stan,"So how did I do?
"
9,12,Brian,"Well, I hate to tell you this, Stan, but... you are one messed-up kid.
"
9,12,Stan,"...Huh??
"
9,12,Brian,"Yeah, I'm afraid that you are completely miserable and totally depressed.
"
9,12,Stan,"I am?? I didn't know that!
"
9,12,Brian,"Well there's certainly no question that you are a perfect candidate for Scientology. I think it can really make you happy again.
"
9,12,Stan,"What what do I do?
"
9,12,Brian,"It's very simple. We just need two hundred and forty dollars.
"
9,12,Sharon,"Stanley, you haven't touched your food. What's the matter with you?
"
9,12,Stan,"I'm totally depressed.
"
9,12,Sharon,"What? Why?
"
9,12,Stan,"I don't know.
"
9,12,Sharon,"Well how long have you been feeling this way?
"
9,12,Stan,"I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.
"
9,12,Randy,"Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!
"
9,12,Stan,"No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.
"
9,12,Randy,"Oh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley.
"
9,12,Stan,"But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!
"
9,12,Sharon,"Stanley, I didn't know you were miserable.
"
9,12,Stan,"Neither did I!
"
9,12,Randy,"Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?
"
9,12,Stan,"Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??
"
9,12,Grandpa,"Huh?
"
9,12,Randy,"Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!
"
9,12,Stan,"...well but... but that's my money.
"
9,12,Randy,"Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?
"
9,12,Kelly,"Michelle, our friend Stan wants to have auditing.
"
9,12,Michelle,"Oho good, you're going to be so happy.
"
9,12,Stan,"I hope so.
"
9,12,Kelly,"It's the beginning of a whole new life for you, Stan. See ya afterwards.
"
9,12,Michelle,"Great, so do you have the two hundred and forty dollars.  Perfect! We're on our way!  Come on over here and I'll fill you in on how the Church of Scientology works.  You see, Stan, Scientology was founded by a great man named L. Ron Hubbard.  Mr. Hubbard discovered that negative emotions are actually caused by things called ""body thetans.""
"
9,12,Stan,"Really?
"
9,12,Michelle,"Yes! And being the genius that he was, Mr. Hubbard invented a way to get rid of those bad thetans.  This is called an E-meter. It's the main tool of Scientology. You just grab a hold of these handles as I talk you through past experiences in your life. I'll be taking readings here, and we'll be able to determine your thetan levels.
"
9,12,Stan,"Thetan levels...
"
9,12,Michelle,"Come on in the auditing room and I'll show you how it works.  All these people are just like you, Stan, auditing with E-meters to get rid of their negative emotions.  All right, Stan, I want you to just relax and take hold of the E-meter handles. 
"
9,12,Stan,"So, this is gonna make me happy?
"
9,12,Michelle,"Just take a few deep breaths, and I'll just get a base reading of your thetan levels.  Huh, that's, that's strange.
"
9,12,Stan,"What?
"
9,12,Michelle,"Somethin-,  something's wrong. Brian, could you come over here a second?
"
9,12,Brian,"Yep- Oh hey there, Greg!
"
9,12,Stan,"Stan.
"
9,12,Michelle,"Will you... look at his thetan levels?
"
9,12,Brian,"Huh, well. We'll get another E-meter - this one's obviously broken. Sorry about this, Greg.
"
9,12,Recruiter,"And so we just try to analyze your personality, and if it seems like you need some help, then you can have an audit counseling for a nominal fee.
"
9,12,Mr. Mackey,"Well, that sounds pretty reasonable, m'kay. 
"
9,12,Brian,"Mike, I need to talk to you!
"
9,12,Mike,"Excuse me, sir, I'll be right back.  Are you all right? You're sweating!
"
9,12,Brian,"Take a look at this.
"
9,12,Mike,"What is it?
"
9,12,Brian,"The E-meter results from the little boy in Room D
"
9,12,Mike,"This... this can't be right. 
"
9,12,Brian,"We ran the tests four times! We used four different E-meters!
"
9,12,Mike,"Fax these results to the head office in Los Angeles. The President has to see thus right away. Go!  Now! 
"
9,12,Woman,"The boy is from a small mountain town in Colorado, sir.
"
9,12,Man,"Sir, how can it be that a first timer scores that kind of thetan level?? He registered OT9! I'm only OT7 and I've been in the church all my life!
"
9,12,President,"I've waited... forty-two years... for this day.
"
9,12,Man,"Sir?
"
9,12,President,"Don't you all see what this means? There was only one person who EVER registered OT9 in the history of our church.  L. Ron Hubbard said he had lived past lives. That when he died his thetan would show itself again. Our prophet has returned. 
"
9,12,Sharon,"Uh, Stanley, take the garbage out before you go to bed.
"
9,12,Stan,"I took out the garbage yesterday.
"
9,12,Randy,"Right now, Stan!
"
9,12,Stan,"Aagh!  Stupid dumb garbage! 
"
9,12,Man 2,"There he is! 
"
9,12,Man 3,"Thank you for returning!
"
9,12,Man 4,"He's wonderful.  He's wonderful.
"
9,12,Randy,"Stan! What the hell did you do?!
"
9,12,Stan,"I don't know! 
"
9,12,President,"Hello young man. I'm the head of Scientology. It is...  a great honor to meet you!
"
9,12,Randy,"All right, what the hell is going on here?!
"
9,12,President,"We've been looking for your son for a long time, Mr. Marsh. He is the reincarnation of our church's most famous prophet.
"
9,12,Sharon,"Wwhat??
"
9,12,President,"Scientologist's the world over are simply rejoicing at his second coming.
"
9,12,Randy,"Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?
"
9,12,President,"We're not asking him to join us, we're asking him... to lead us.
"
9,12,Shelly,"Oh my God, it's John Travolta! 
"
9,12,John Travolta,"Is this where he lives? Is this where L. Ron Hubbard is? Oh my god!
"
9,12,President,"Yes, John Travolta and Tom Cruise are big Scientologist's. Do you believe me nooow?  Young man, I know you don't remember it,but... your name was L. Ron Hubbard. You revealed the secret that began the whole Church of Scientology.
"
9,12,Randy,"Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this. 
"
9,12,Stan,"Jesus Christ...
"
9,12,Cruise,"L. Ron?  L. Ron! It really is you!  Oh, this is the greatest day of my life!
"
9,12,Stan,"Aw dude, I need to go to bed.
"
9,12,Cruise,"Don't you understand, L. Ron? It's me! Tom Cruise!
"
9,12,Stan,"Yeah, I know who you are.
"
9,12,Cruise,"Ha-haven't I done well, L. Ron? Haven't you enjoyed my acting? Which film did you like best?
"
9,12,Stan,"Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.
"
9,12,Cruise,"...What?
"
9,12,Stan,"I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay.
"
9,12,Cruise,"I'm nothing.  I'm a failure in the eyes of the Prophet! AAAH! 
"
9,12,Stan,"Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
"
9,12,Cruise,"Go away!
"
9,12,Stan,"Dude, this is my room!
"
9,12,Cruise,"Go away, I said!
"
9,12,Stan,"Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!
"
9,12,Cruise,"What?!
"
9,12,Stan,"Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. 
"
9,12,Randy,"Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet.
"
9,12,Cruise,"No!
"
9,12,Randy,"Come on, Mr. Cruise, this is ridiculous.
"
9,12,Cruise,"I'm never coming out!
"
9,12,Randy,"What did you say to him?
"
9,12,Stan,"I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.
"
9,12,Randy,"Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out.
"
9,12,Sharon,"What's going on?
"
9,12,Randy,"Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
"
9,12,Sharon,"What??
"
9,12,Cruise,"Just leave me alone!
"
9,12,Randy,"Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!
"
9,12,Field Reporter,"It's been four hours now, and Tom Cruise still will not come out of the closet. Hundreds of onlookers here have gathered here in hopes that the celebrity will finally give in.
"
9,12,Sergeant,"Tom Cruise, this is Park County police! Please come out of the closet.  Everybody here just wants you to come out of the closet, Tom.  Nobody's gonna be mad, everything's gonna be all right. Just come out of the closet.
"
9,12,Field Reporter,"We're still not exactly sure why Tom Cruise is in the closet, but I'm being joined now by famous singer/songwriter R. Kelly.
"
9,12,R. Kelly,"Well I was just standing here, and Tom Cruise locked himself in the closetI asked myself why won't Tom Cruise just come out the closet?Nobody has no answers, and so I pull out my gun!
"
9,12,President,"Please, understand, we just want what is best for your son. The reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard must be taken care of. He had many enemies.
"
9,12,Randy,"Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer?
"
9,12,President,"Yes. But he was also a prophet... who knew the secret truth about the nature of life.
"
9,12,Sharon,"This is just too much.
"
9,12,President,"We want to reveal to Stan the great secret of life behind our church. The safely-guarded Scientology doctrine. Please, your son deserves to be enlightened.
"
9,12,Randy,"Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?
"
9,12,Stan,"Sure.
"
9,12,Randy,"All right, go ahead and tell him.
"
9,12,President,"Would you excuse us, please? This is highly-classified church information.
"
9,12,Randy,"Aw rats. 
"
9,12,President,"Usually, to hear the secret doctrine, you have to be in the church for several years, Stan.  Are you ready to hear the truth?
"
9,12,Stan,"I, I guess.
"
9,12,President,"You see, Stan, there is a reason for people feeling sad and depressed.  An alien reason. It all began 75 million years ago. Back then there was a galactinc federation of planets which was ruled over by the evil Lord Xenu.
"
9,12,Xenu,"Ho ho ho ho ho ho.
"
9,12,President,"Xenu thought his galaxy was overpopulated,  and so he rounded up countless aliens from all different planets,  and then had those aliens frozen. 
"
9,12,Xenu,"Wa ha ha ha!
"
9,12,President,"The frozen alien bodies were loaded onto Xenu's galactic cruisers, which looked like DC-8s, except with rocket engines. The cruisers then took the frozen alien bodies to our planet, to Earth, and dumped them into the volcanoes of Hawaii.  The aliens were no longer frozen, they were dead. The souls of those aliens, however, lived on, and all floated up towards the sky. But the evil Lord Xenu had prepared for this.
"
9,12,Xenu,"Wa ha ha ha!
"
9,12,President,"Xenu didn't want their souls to return! And so he built giant soul-catchers in the sky!  The souls were taken to a huge soul brain-washing facility, which Xenu had ALSO built on Earth.  There the souls were forced to watch days of brainwashing material  which tricked them into believing a false reality. Xenu then released the alien souls, which roamed the earth aimlessly in a fog of confusion. At the dawn of man, the souls finally found bodies which they can grab onto. They attached themselves to all mankind, which still to this day causes all our fears, our confusions, and our problems.  L. Ron Hubbard did an amazing thing telling the world this incredible truth. Now all we're asking you to do...  is pick up where he left off.
"
9,12,Stan,"But I don't know any of this stuff.
"
9,12,President,"Neither did L. Ron when he started. He said he just closed his eyes, and wrote down whatever came to mind. You can do the same. Just let it flow.
"
9,12,Stan,"Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
"
9,12,President,"I know. We've sent Nicole Kidman up there to see if she can help.
"
9,12,Nicole,"Tom? Tom, It's Nicole.
"
9,12,Cruise,"Ah hi Nicole.
"
9,12,Nicole,"Tom, don't you think this has gone on long enough? It's time for you to come out of the closet.
"
9,12,Cruise,"...I'm not, I'm not in the closet.
"
9,12,Nicole,"Yes you are, Tom. And you need to just end this and come out.  I'm not gonna think any differently of you. Katie's not gonna think any differently of you. You don't need to be in that closet anymore, Tom.
"
9,12,Cruise,"I'm not in here, though.
"
9,12,Nicole,"Yes, you are.
"
9,12,Cruise,"I'm not, ...I'm not in the closet.
"
9,12,Nicole,"Then how am I talking to you, Tom?  Tom, you can't hide forever just because the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard doesn't like your acting. Come out of the closet, Tom. You're not fooling anyone.
"
9,12,Cruise,"I'm, I'm not, I'm not in here.
"
9,12,Stan,"Yeah, yeah!
"
9,12,Kyle,"Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.
"
9,12,Stan,"I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.
"
9,12,Kyle,"Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.
"
9,12,Stan,"Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.
"
9,12,Kyle,"Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.
"
9,12,Stan,"I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
"
9,12,Kyle,"What secret truth??
"
9,12,Stan,"I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!
"
9,12,Kyle,"I didn't know you were depressed.
"
9,12,Stan,"Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! 
"
9,12,Cartman,"Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. 
"
9,12,Travolta,"Tom! Hey Tom, this is John Travolta.
"
9,12,Cruise,"Oh hey John.
"
9,12,Travolta,"Tom, you've gotta come out of the closet. Oh my God.
"
9,12,Cruise,"L. Ron Hubbard doesn't think I'm a great actor.
"
9,12,Travolta,"Mm-maybe you took what he said out of context. Okay, 's like, if you don't come out, can I at least come in and talk to you?
"
9,12,Cruise,"Oh... Okay, but no tricks.
"
9,12,Travolta,"No tricks.  Hey, it's really nice n here.
"
9,12,Cruise,"Yeah, see?
"
9,12,Travolta,"I feel really safe. Oh my god.
"
9,12,Randy,"Hello?  Hey, come out of there!
"
9,12,Field Reporter,"Tom, it now appears that John Travolta is also in the closet, and he refuses to come out. Here with more details once again, is R. Kelly.
"
9,12,R. Kelly,"I was just standing here. Tom Cruise locked himself in the closetThen John Travolta come and now, John Travolta in the closet too.Please Tom Cruise and John Travolta come out the closet!But then I calm myself down, and I pull out my gun!
"
9,12,Field Reporter,"Oh geez, here we go with the gun again.
"
9,12,President,"Yes... Yes, oh this is great, Stan!
"
9,12,Stan,"I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.
"
9,12,President,"Yes, of course! So wonderful!
"
9,12,Stan,"And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.
"
9,12,President,"Yes, of course!
"
9,12,Stan,"And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.
"
9,12,President,"What?
"
9,12,Stan,"I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.
"
9,12,President,"What are you, stupid?! Then how do we make money from those people?!
"
9,12,Stan,"... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?
"
9,12,President,"Wait a minute, whoa, whoa! You don't actually believe this crap, do you?? Dummy! Brainwashed alien souls?? E-meters and thetan levels?? Those people out there buy that crap and I thought YOU were smart enough to see what was really going on!
"
9,12,Stan,"But you said that there were-
"
9,12,President,"What's better than telling people a stupid story and having them believe you?!  Having them PAY you for it, stupid!
"
9,12,Stan,"But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?
"
9,12,President,"Because if those people all think you're the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, then they'll all buy your new writings, and you and I together will make three million dollars!
"
9,12,Stan,"Three million dollars?
"
9,12,President,"That's how the scam works! But this is a scam on a global scale! Do you fucking get me now?! 
"
9,12,Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, I get you.
"
9,12,President,"Then keep writing, L. Ron! Your people are waiting.
"
9,12,Field Reporter,"Breaking news here in South Park. Tom Cruise and John Travolta still... will not come out of the closet. Park County police have decided to try a new method.
"
9,12,R. Kelly,"I've been asked to come up here, get you both out of the closetMan, this is some crazy shit. Why won't you both just come out the closet?And they said...
"
9,12,"Cruise, Travolta","We're not comin' out the closet, so you can just go away.
"
9,12,R. Kelly,"But everyone wants you out the closet.
"
9,12,"Cruise, Travolta","That doesn't matter 'cause we're gonna stay.
"
9,12,R. Kelly,"Now I'm startin' to get angry, so I pull out my gun! 
"
9,12,President,"My fellow Scientologist's! Our prophet has finished his new doctrine, and will now read some passages before making it available to you all for a nominal fee.  I give you... the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard! 
"
9,12,Stan,"Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.
"
9,12,Crowd,"Ohhhh.
"
9,12,Man,"Nubanon.
"
9,12,Stan,"And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this.
"
9,12,President,"Huh, what?
"
9,12,Stan,"Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.
"
9,12,Man 2,"Huh?
"
9,12,Woman,"What?
"
9,12,Stan,"I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.
"
9,12,Brian,"Oh! We are gonna sue you!
"
9,12,Stan,"What??
"
9,12,President,"Yeah, you think you can say our religion is a lie?! We'll sue you, buddy!
"
9,12,Stan,"YOU told me it was a lie!
"
9,12,President,"Ho, now you're puttin' words in MY mouth! You are so sued!
"
9,12,Man 3,"You can't make fun of Scientology, kid! We are gonna sue your ass AND your balls!
"
9,12,Crowd,"Yeah, that's right!
"
9,12,President,"How dare you mock our faith, you little punk?! You'll be hearing from our lawyers tomorrow!
"
9,12,Field Reporter,"We've just had an incredible development here, Mitch. Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly, have all come out of the closet! 
"
9,12,Cruise,"So you're NOT the prophet, huh?! You made me look stupid! I'm gonna sue you too!
"
9,12,Stan,"Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!
"
9,12,Cruise,"I will! I'll sue you in England!
"
9,12,President,"You are so sued, kid!
"
9,12,Stan,"Well go on, then! Sue me!
"
9,12,President,"We're going to!
"
9,12,Stan,"Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!
"
9,13,Announcer,"And now, Jambu is going to going to give you all a big wave! 
"
9,13,Cartman,"I'm all wet! Sweet!
"
9,13,Kyle,"Dude, Jambu is the best! 
"
9,13,Announcer,"Now get ready for Jambu's next trick. 
"
9,13,Cartman,"Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!
"
9,13,Announcer,"How about that, folks! A full body flip! And now, Kelly's gonna show us how she makes Jambu do his tricks.  When Kelly slaps her hand three times, Jambu comes to her. Jambu will stay and wait until Kelly gives him a command.  Oh, what trick are we gonna see? Get those cameras ready!  That's Kelly riding on Jambu's nose!  I wish Kelly would ride on my nose. 
"
9,13,Cartman,"Yes! Yeehehehes! 
"
9,13,Announcer,"We hope you enjoyed Jambu's orca show, and enjoy the rest of your day at Denver's Sea Park!  You bunch of retards. 
"
9,13,Stan,"Okay, where to next?
"
9,13,Cartman,"I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Why?
"
9,13,Kyle,"Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?
"
9,13,Stan,"Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Killer. 
"
9,13,Kyle,"I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.
"
9,13,Jambu,"Hello, little boy.  You like my flippers?
"
9,13,Kyle,"Who said that?
"
9,13,Jambu,"I did.
"
9,13,Kyle,"No way!
"
9,13,Jambu,"This is very exciting! Usually when I talk, nobody can hear me. Where are you from?
"
9,13,Kyle,"South Park.
"
9,13,Jambu,"It sure is nice to have somebody to talk to. Can't we talk more? Please?
"
9,13,Kyle,"What do you wanna talk about?
"
9,13,Jambu,"Let's talk about rocket ships.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Rocket ships?
"
9,13,Jambu,"Yeah. I love rockets, but I can't see them 'cause I'm stuck in this tank. . You know, someday, I wish that I could go up in space in a rocket ship.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Why? Aren't you happy here?
"
9,13,Jambu,"I try to be, but my wish is to one day blast off in a big rocket ship!
"
9,13,Kyle,"This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! 
"
9,13,Jambu,"Oh God, it's funny every single time. 
"
9,13,Stingray Announcer,"And for those of you just joining us, this is the stingray tank. Stingrays are members of the shark family, but they're extremely peaceful creatures. We invite you to gently touch the top of them as they swim by.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!
"
9,13,Kyle,"Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
"
9,13,Stan,"What?
"
9,13,Kyle,"Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!
"
9,13,Kenny,"(What the fuck are you talking about?)
"
9,13,Kyle,"I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?
"
9,13,Cartman,"Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.
"
9,13,Kyle,"He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!
"
9,13,Partner,"Dude, he's back, he's back! 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Goddammit, say something!
"
9,13,Cartman,"Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.
"
9,13,Jambu,"Please don't call me stupid.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
"
9,13,Jambu,"I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't talk. It's because I'm very very sick, you see.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Sick?
"
9,13,Stan,"I don't believe it.
"
9,13,Jambu,"Yes, because I'm not used to the earth atmosphere. You see, my name is actually Willzy-x, and I'm from the moon! 
"
9,13,Partner,"The moon?
"
9,13,Jambu,"The... that's where all orca whales are from. If I don't get back to the moon, I'm going to die.
"
9,13,Cartman,"You live on the moon?
"
9,13,Jambu,"I used to. I wish I could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Oh my God...
"
9,13,Stan,"Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
"
9,13,Jambu,"I can't tell them, because they're evil communists from the Horsehead Nebula. They want to kill all us zypods, so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform.
"
9,13,Kyle,"That's terrible!
"
9,13,Partner,"Dude, dude, the boss is coming!
"
9,13,Jambu,"Uh, uh, sorry boys, I can't talk anymore. I'm too sick.  Can't. Talk. Any. More. 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
"
9,13,Butters,"Well okay! Let's do it!
"
9,13,Kyle,"The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.
"
9,13,Clyde,"...A whale. Talked to you.
"
9,13,Stan,"It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
"
9,13,Craig,"Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?
"
9,13,Craig,"Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
"
9,13,Craig,"...So it's true.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?
"
9,13,Token,"...What do we do?
"
9,13,Kyle,"Stan? 
"
9,13,Stan,"All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.
"
9,13,Timmy,"Timmihhhhh... 
"
9,13,Stan,"Craig, Token, get the slings ready. 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.
"
9,13,Announcer,"Dude, did you see that episode of Trading Spouses last night? That was insane. Yeah, well ha- whoa. What the hell? 
"
9,13,Owner,"How could you not have seen anything?? It's a whale, for Christ's sake!
"
9,13,Guard,"It must have been taken while I was going to the bathroom.
"
9,13,Owner,"Were you in there for three hours?!
"
9,13,Guard,"Don't yell at me! 
"
9,13,Announcer,"What happened?
"
9,13,Kelly,"Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park.
"
9,13,Partner,"What? How?
"
9,13,Guard,"I DON'T KNOW!
"
9,13,Sergeant,"All right, people, it's obvious we're dealing with a highly intelligent animal-rights group. Those bastards have done stuff like this before.
"
9,13,Nelson,"Sir! Sir, we've found a note!
"
9,13,Owner,"A note? Let me see that.  We're taking Willzy-x home to the moon. Long live the zypods!  What the hell does that mean?
"
9,13,Sergeant,"Harris, run a fingerprint on that note!  Nelson! Find out what kind of crayon it was written with.  We'll find out who was responsible for this! 
"
9,13,Partner,"We have to tell them! We know what those boys look like!
"
9,13,Announcer,"We can't tell them, then they're, they're gonna think this is all our fault
"
9,13,Partner,"It IS all our fault!
"
9,13,Announcer,"How were we supposed to know that they were gonna actually do it?!
"
9,13,Partner,"I shouldn't have laughed. All those times we've messed with those kids' heads, I shouldn't have just sat there and laughed.
"
9,13,Announcer,"Don't you say that! It was funny! It was really funny! We've just...  we've just gotta make this right ourselves.
"
9,13,Partner,"How?
"
9,13,Announcer,"We've gotta track down those kids. Before the police do!
"
9,13,Putin,"Comrades, I'm afraid our situation is dire. The economy is stale and I... Very soon, Mother Russia... will no longer be a country.
"
9,13,Aide,"Sir! Sir, somebody is on telephone! Another rich American wants to fly into space! 
"
9,13,Putin,"Hello? Hello, this is Russian President.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.
"
9,13,Putin,"Yes, we certainly do!  What were you looking for?
"
9,13,Kyle,"I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
"
9,13,Putin,"The moon. That is quite large trip, but I'm sure we can do it!
"
9,13,Kyle,"You can? Awesome!
"
9,13,Putin,"It sounds like we're in business! We will just need, say, twenty million dollars?
"
9,13,Kyle,"Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
"
9,13,Putin,"...What?
"
9,13,Kyle,"But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
"
9,13,Putin,"Goddamnit it is prank call again!  Kiss my ass, George Bush! This is not funny! 
"
9,13,Stan,"What happened?
"
9,13,Kyle,"They want twenty million dollars.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?
"
9,13,Craig,"That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?
"
9,13,Stan,"They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.
"
9,13,Tweek,"Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!
"
9,13,Kyle,"All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
"
9,13,Clyde,"Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!
"
9,13,Anchor Tom,"A beloved performing orca whale has been stolen from the Denver Sea Park. A full investigation is underway, but tracking down the kidnappers is proving to be one WHALE of a problem.
"
9,13,Field Reporter,"Thanks, Tom, I'm here at the Denver Sea Park where, believe it or not, dozens of people have come to show support for whoever took the whale. 
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"That's right. We are members of the Animal Liberation Front! Whales do not belong in tanks, they belong in the ocean! We applaud whoever did this noble deed! Set the whales free!
"
9,13,Protesters,"Set the whales free!
"
9,13,Field Reporter,"One thing for certain: something is certainly FISHY here at the Sea Park. Tom?
"
9,13,Anchor Tom,"Thank, Mitch. It seems that this problem is almost un-BEAR-able.  Let's hope that whale is found.
"
9,13,Partner,"This is so bad, man. How do we even know this is the right town to look in??
"
9,13,Announcer,"Will you relax? Those kids said they were from South Park. We've just gotta go door to door. Do you have the composite sketch we did?
"
9,13,Partner,"Yeah.
"
9,13,Announcer,"Let's go! 
"
9,13,Partner,"Maybe you should start with the houses on the left, a-and I'll take the-
"
9,13,Announcer,"Wait a minute. Check that out!  Come on!  Oh my good, look!
"
9,13,Partner,"Whale poo.
"
9,13,Announcer,"We're close. We're really close!
"
9,13,Mrs. Donovan,"Can I help you?
"
9,13,Announcer,"Oh... h-hello ma'am. We're just here to examine your pool.
"
9,13,Mrs. Donovan,"Oh.
"
9,13,Partner,"Have you noticed any whales in your pool at all?
"
9,13,Mrs. Donovan,"No, I don't believe so. But we've been out of town for a couple of days and came back to find the fence broken. Do you think somebody's been using it?
"
9,13,Announcer,"Ma'am, do you recognize any of these boys? 
"
9,13,Mrs. Donovan,"The fat one in the middle... kinda looks like Dakota Fanning. Excuse me, gentlemen, I have to get back to the oven. 
"
9,13,Partner,"We're too late. They've moved on to another town!
"
9,13,Announcer,"We don't know that!
"
9,13,Partner,"If they've moved on, then we have no leads! This is fate, Brian! It's fate! For telling the kids their naked dads were gonna beat them up! For thinking that screwing with kids was funny!
"
9,13,Announcer,"It WAS funny!! It was funny, Bob! And it will be funny again, I swear to you! If those boys took the whale out of here, we would have seen them on the road! I'm telling you, we're close. It's going to be funny!
"
9,13,Sheila,"Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?
"
9,13,Kyle,"I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.
"
9,13,Sheila,"All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry. 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Okay ma, thanks! 
"
9,13,Butters,"Shouldn't we get him back in the water?
"
9,13,Clyde,"Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
"
9,13,Jimmy,"The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
"
9,13,Jimmy,"Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fuck ourselves.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
"
9,13,Cartman,"He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
"
9,13,Clyde,"Mexico has a space program?
"
9,13,Stan,"Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?
"
9,13,Man,"Allб
"
9,13,Stan,"Thanks.  Is this the Mexican space program? 
"
9,13,Man 2,"Space, sн. Fly.
"
9,13,Stan,"Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?
"
9,13,Man 2,"Follow, sí, show yo.  The roque lunar?
"
9,13,Stan,"This rocket will fly to the moon?
"
9,13,Man 2,"Sí, fly.
"
9,13,Stan,"To the moon?
"
9,13,Man 2,"Sí.
"
9,13,Stan,"We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?
"
9,13,Man 2,"O-ah... Two hundred.
"
9,13,Stan,"Two hundred? Million?
"
9,13,Man 2,"Two hundred... dollars.
"
9,13,Stan,"Quick, call Kyle.
"
9,13,Announcer,"Eh hello ma'am, uh, the teacher at the school said she recognized this boy to be your son? 
"
9,13,Sheila,"Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though.
"
9,13,Announcer,"Ma'am, we need to talk to your son, please! It's very urgent!
"
9,13,Sheila,"I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico.
"
9,13,Both men,"Mexico??
"
9,13,Sheila,"Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring.
"
9,13,Partner,"Oh my God.
"
9,13,Announcer,"Which highway did they take??
"
9,13,Cartman,"Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy.
"
9,13,Cartman,"We have to hurry!
"
9,13,Driver,"I'm going as fast as I can.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.
"
9,13,Butters,"Oh hamburgers! What is that?? 
"
9,13,Brian,"All right, out of the truck!
"
9,13,Cartman,"Uh oh.
"
9,13,Driver,"What the hell is goin' on?!
"
9,13,Brian,"You're carrying a stolen whale!
"
9,13,Driver,"Stolen? You kids told me you won that whale at Pizza Hut!
"
9,13,Clyde,"We're busted. 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Huh?
"
9,13,Brian,"Come on out, kid. 
"
9,13,Driver,"Look, I didn't know nothin' about this.
"
9,13,Brian,"Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this.
"
9,13,Kyle,"You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!
"
9,13,Partner,"Look, kid, we need to tell you a little secret. 
"
9,13,Cop 1,"What's goin' on here??
"
9,13,Brian,"Aw crap.
"
9,13,Butters,"Oh, now we're gonna get it.
"
9,13,Cop 1,"Hey... That's the stolen whale!
"
9,13,Cop 2,"Everyone down on the ground. Now!
"
9,13,Kyle,"No! Please, we have to go!
"
9,13,Cop 2,"You're not goin' anywhere! You're in a lot of trouble! 
"
9,13,Kyle,"But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
"
9,13,Cop 1,"We said down on the ground, kid. Move it! 
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"Leave those kids alone, you bastards! Animal Liberation Front! 
"
9,13,Cop 1,"Put down that weapon, now!
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"These boys are trying to get that whale home! You're not gonna stop them!
"
9,13,Kyle,"All right!!
"
9,13,The Other Boys,"Yes! Wow!
"
9,13,Cop 2,"That whale belongs to a sea park!
"
9,13,Kyle,"It belongs with its family!
"
9,13,ALF Member,"That's right!
"
9,13,Cop 1,"I said drop the gun NOW!
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"Save the whale! 
"
9,13,Partner,"Jesus, Oh God! 
"
9,13,ALF Member,"Save the whales, motherfucker!
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"Where are you taking the whale?
"
9,13,Kyle,"Tijuana, Mexico!
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"Of course. Brilliant! Release it in international waters. I'll drive the truck. 
"
9,13,Kyle,"You're going home, Willzy-x! 
"
9,13,Brian,"Mike? Mike??
"
9,13,Mike,"It... wasn't... funny...
"
9,13,Brian,"Don't say that, Mike. It was funny. It just wasn't that funny this time.  All the other times were still funny, Mike! They were still funny!!
"
9,13,Cop 1,"Forty-five to dispatch... Stolen whale... heading to Tijuana... Whaaale to Tijuana!! 
"
9,13,Worker 1,"Conecte la segunda cadena. 
"
9,13,Worker 2,"No sé si va a llegar. 
"
9,13,Stan,"They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?
"
9,13,Manuel,"Sн, fly.
"
9,13,Butters,"Look! The Mexican border!
"
9,13,Clyde,"Oh Jesus, they're here! 
"
9,13,Sergeant,"Hold your positions! 
"
9,13,Owner,"Aha! We've got them!
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"Hang on, boys.

9,13,Owner,"Mary Mother of God! 
"
9,13,Sergeant,"Get them!
"
9,13,Kyle,"Willzy-x, I think we're here.
"
9,13,Stan,"Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"You got it, kid! 
"
9,13,Owner,"Don't let them get that whale in the water! 
"
9,13,Stan,"Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water! 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Come on, guys! 
"
9,13,Owner,"Stop right now!
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"Hurry, boys! We'll take care of them! 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 
"
9,13,Cartman,"Oh crap! There's more of them! 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Get him in the water!  Goodbye, Willzy-x! 
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"Swim, mighty whale! You're free!
"
9,13,Stan,"Okay, Manuel, hit it. 
"
9,13,Owner,"Stop! That is my whale!
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"I'm afraid you're too late! The whale's been set free.
"
9,13,Owner,"No!
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"Now you see that your ways of captivity and exploiting animals will never prevail.  Not as long as there are children like these who still believe in the beauty and magic of freedom.  For it is children, with their innocence and their spirit, who know what is truly best for all the world.
"
9,13,ALF Leader,"Oh my God!
"
9,13,Kyle,"We did it!
"
9,13,Stan,"Thanks for the ride, Manuel.
"
9,13,Manuel,"Sн, bye. 
"
9,13,Butters,"Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.
"
9,13,Clyde,"Yeah, me too. 
"
9,13,Kyle,"All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. 
"
9,13,Stan,"I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
"
9,13,Kyle,"I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.

"
9,14,Cartman,"Yeah, let's go.
"
9,14,Stan,"Wait. Where's my Dad?
"
9,14,Kyle,"He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?
"
9,14,Stan,"Yeah.
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??
"
9,14,Randy,"Oh hey, sorry boys.
"
9,14,Male Voice,"Later Randy.
"
9,14,Randy,"Hey, see you Nelson.
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, weren't you watching?
"
9,14,Randy,"Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home. 
"
9,14,Kyle,"Are you sure you're all right?
"
9,14,Randy,"Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going.
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?
"
9,14,Randy,"I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys?
"
9,14,Stan,"Sure, whatever dude.
"
9,14,Randy,"...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan.
"
9,14,Stan,"Why not just pull over?
"
9,14,Randy,"Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  There's a  reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan.  When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp! 
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, we're gonna crash!
"
9,14,Randy,"Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Just hold the damn wheel! 
"
9,14,Kyle,"Dude, I think you're being followed. 
"
9,14,Randy,"Oh yeah?  Get off my ass, dickhole!
"
9,14,Kyle,"No, dude, it's the police. 
"
9,14,Randy,"Aww crap!  Here, hold this! 
"
9,14,Stan,"Aww, it's all warm!
"
9,14,Randy,"Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal. 
"
9,14,Officer,"License and registration, please.
"
9,14,Randy,"What seems to be the officer, problem?
"
9,14,Officer,"...Sir, why don't you step out of the car for me?
"
9,14,Randy,"Okay. 
"
9,14,Officer,"Sir, I'm going to give you a sobriety test.
"
9,14,Randy,"Okay, no problem. Easy.
"
9,14,Officer,"Stand over here, please?  Right there. All right, now I want you to hold your arms out at your sides... 
"
9,14,Randy,"Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!
"
9,14,Officer,"And now touch your finger to your nose.
"
9,14,Randy,"Do what??
"
9,14,Officer,"Touch your finger to your nose.
"
9,14,Randy,"Wull come on, that's impossible!
"
9,14,Officer,"Just bring one hand to your nose, like this. 
"
9,14,Randy,"Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  Okay, hang, ha-, ...hang on... Hol-! Hold on.  Wa-hang on, hang on. 
"
9,14,Cartman,"Dude, what the hell is he doing?
"
9,14,Kyle,"I think his pants are falling down.
"
9,14,Randy,"What? What did I do?!  What did I do?!
"
9,14,Officer 2,"Keep blowing. Keep blowing.  Keep blowing.  Aw Jesus!
"
9,14,Stan,"This is sooo embarrassing.
"
9,14,Cartman,"You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!
"
9,14,Kyle,"You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
"
9,14,Cartman,"Man, that was such a bummer.
"
9,14,Stan,"Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?
"
9,14,Cartman,"Why?
"
9,14,Stan,"Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?
"
9,14,Cartman,"All right, Stan. Sure. 
"
9,14,Mrs. Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats.  Today we will be continuing our study of economics. But first, we're going to hear from a motivational speaker. The state has sent over somebody to talk to you all about the dangers of drunk driving. Please welcome Stan's dad. 
"
9,14,Stan,"Oh Jesus. 
"
9,14,Randy,"Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these.
"
9,14,Mrs. Garrison,"Oh that's very interesting, isn't it, kids? 
"
9,14,Randy,"Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.
"
9,14,Mrs. Garrison,"...Well, I think we've all learned an important lesson, haven't we, class? If you don't make the right choices in life, you could end up being a big loser like Stan's dad.  Drinking and driving is for idiots. Nobody wants to end up like Stan's dad, do they?  I want you all to take a good look at Stan's dad and say, ""Is that who I want to be in thirty years? Getting tickets and having to go to elementary school classrooms and talk about how pathetic I am?"" Thank you Mr. Marsh, I think you made your point. 
"
9,14,AA Speaker,"Hello again everyone, my name is Michael, and, I'm an alcoholic.
"
9,14,Group,"Hi, Michael.
"
9,14,Michael,"As most of you know I once lost my job and my family because of my drinking. But with the help of AA I've been sober for ten years now.  Anyone have anything they wanna tell the groups, for starters?
"
9,14,Man 1,"My name's Bill, and Im an alcoholic.
"
9,14,Group,"Hi Bill.
"
9,14,Randy,"Hi Bill.
"
9,14,Bill,"I've been using the 12-step program for about two months now and, and I'm really turning my life around. No more blowing guys on Colfax Avenue for a pint of vodka for THIS cowboy! 
"
9,14,Michael,"That's great. And I understand this is somebody's first AA meeting, is that right? &lt;/&gt; Y-yes, you sir. Stand on up and introduce yourself.
"
9,14,Randy,"Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.
"
9,14,Man 2,"You have to admit you're an alcoholic.
"
9,14,Randy,"But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic.
"
9,14,Big Woman,"Then why are you here?
"
9,14,Randy,"Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.
"
9,14,Michael,"Randy, you are powerless to make that decision. The only thing that works is the 12-step program.  Step 1 is admitting that you are powerless to control your drinking. Only then can you move on to the other 12 steps, like, believing that only a higher power, God, makes you stop drinking. And then, turning your life over to that God and, humbly asking God to remove your weaknesses.
"
9,14,Randy,"What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing.
"
9,14,Michael,"Well it's not religious. You just have to admit that there is some kind of god which has power over you and turn your life over to that god and ask him for forgiveness. That's the 12-step program, not religion.
"
9,14,Randy,"Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again.
"
9,14,Michael,"You just can't cut down on your drinking, Randy. You need to know something. You have a disease.
"
9,14,Randy,"Uh... a disease?
"
9,14,Michael,"That's right. Alcoholism is a disease. You're sick, Randy. You're very very sick. And just like with most diseases, you can't cure it yourself. And it's deadly.
"
9,14,Randy,"Oh my God...
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
"
9,14,Randy,"Hello, Stan.
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!
"
9,14,Randy,"No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick.
"
9,14,Stan,"What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!
"
9,14,Randy,"Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease. 
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now!
"
9,14,Randy,"I can't! I'm sick!  It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?!  Stan! Stan!  Stan.
"
9,14,Stan,"Aww, Goddammit!
"
9,14,Randy,"Stan I... need your help.
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!
"
9,14,Randy,"Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?
"
9,14,Stan,"No! You don't need another beer!
"
9,14,Randy,"I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.
"
9,14,Randy,"I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle.
"
9,14,Priest,"Es un milagro.   Es un milagro! 
"
9,14,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in the garden of St. Peter's church in Bailey, where what some call a miracle is taking place. The statue of the Virgin Mary has started to bleed. Out its ass.  The phenomenon was first seen by Father Harold Barnes,  who saw the blood coming from the Virgin Mary's ass late last night.  People from all over the state have flocked here to the church to witness the apparent miracle firsthand.
"
9,14,Woman 1,"Well, we just heard that this miracle was happening and we wanted to see it for ourselves and come and pray.
"
9,14,Field Reporter,"Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood?
"
9,14,Woman 2,"Well it may represent her sorrow over all the bad things going on in the world.
"
9,14,Field Reporter,"Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood out her ass?  As news of the miracle spreads, hundreds are expected to show up here at the church, hoping to witness the miracle, and even cure their diseases.
"
9,14,Randy,"Cure... cure disease. STAN!!
"
9,14,Man 3,"My name is Harry and I'm an alcoholic.
"
9,14,Group,"Hi Harry.
"
9,14,Harry,"I've been sober now for five years and I I've learned that drinking ice tea and, and getting more involved with my relationship with God is, is, is way more fun than partying.
"
9,14,Woman 2,"It it sure is.
"
9,14,Harry,"Once I accepted that I was powerless to control my drinking and my life, I I put it in God's hands and now, these meeting are the most fun thing I do.
"
9,14,Man 4,"Yeah. 
"
9,14,Stan,"Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here?
"
9,14,Michael,"None of us are in charge. We're all powerless.
"
9,14,Group,"We sure are. That's right. Uh huh.
"
9,14,Stan,"Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?
"
9,14,Harry,"Alcoholism is a disease.
"
9,14,Stan,"No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac
"
9,14,Man 2,"It is a disease because it's a physical dependency. That makes it a disease.
"
9,14,Stan,"No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.
"
9,14,Michael,"He can't quit by himself. None of us could. He needs divine intervention. Spirituality.
"
9,14,Stan,"No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.
"
9,14,Michael,"Young man, do you know anything about the 12-Step Program?
"
9,14,Stan,"Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit! 
"
9,14,Field Reporter,"The crowd grows larger every hour, as the statue of the Virgin Mary continues to miraculously cry blood... out her ass. A Cardinal, Mallory, has been sent by the Vatican to determine whether this is a true miracle or not. 
"
9,14,Father Barnes,"Right this way, Cardinal.  The blood always comes from the same area. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. 
"
9,14,Cardinal Mallory,"It's a miracle! 
"
9,14,Randy,"Uh, kay, here we go. 
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?!
"
9,14,Randy,"I gotta drive to Bailey. 
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!
"
9,14,Randy,"No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass.
"
9,14,Stan,"What??
"
9,14,Randy,"They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!
"
9,14,Randy,"Alright... then you drive. 
"
9,14,Stan,"... I'm eight!
"
9,14,Randy,"This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!
"
9,14,Randy,"I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!
"
9,14,Stan,"Where? I can't see.
"
9,14,Randy,"Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back. 
"
9,14,Randy,"Is this the line?  Oh God!  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?
"
9,14,Man 5,"Yeah. I was diagnosed with brain cancer two months ago. I feel like this is my only hope.
"
9,14,Randy,"I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism.
"
9,14,Stan,"Oh my God...
"
9,14,Randy,"Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him.
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, let's just wait our turn.
"
9,14,Randy,"I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?
"
9,14,Josh,"Oh, hey Randy. What happened to you??
"
9,14,Randy,"I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?
"
9,14,Josh,"Mm-my  daughter has elephantitis 
"
9,14,Randy,"We are the same, she and I.
"
9,14,Man 6,"Eey, what do you think you're doin', kid?
"
9,14,Old Woman,"You're trying to cut in line!
"
9,14,Stan,"I just, my dad was-
"
9,14,Man 7,"You're a butter! You're a dirty line cutter! 
"
9,14,Old Woman 2,"Praise Jesus. 
"
9,14,Randy,"This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!
"
9,14,Stan,"What?!
"
9,14,Randy,"You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place.
"
9,14,Stan,"No, Dad, people will see!
"
9,14,Randy,"The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go! 
"
9,14,Blind Man,"Hey. I smell a butter.
"
9,14,Woman 3,"He did, that kid just cut in line!
"
9,14,Man 8,"Back o'the line, butter!
"
9,14,Randy,"I'm going to die!
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, we're going back!
"
9,14,Officer,"What's goin' on here?
"
9,14,Man 9,"This kid's cutting in line!
"
9,14,Randy,"Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it.
"
9,14,Officer,"...I understand. My, my brother's an alcoholic. Here, let me push you to the front of the line. 
"
9,14,Randy,"Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through!  She's... beautiful.  Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah!  I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this!  It's a miracle! I'm cured!  Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God! 
"
9,14,Randy,"Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  It's just amazing. I haven't had a drink in five days. Praise Christ. Praise him. 
"
9,14,Stan,"Praise Christ.
"
9,14,Shelly,"Praise Christ.
"
9,14,Randy,"I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me.
"
9,14,Stan,"Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come.
"
9,14,Randy,"Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power.
"
9,14,Group,"Yeah, all right, woohoo! 
"
9,14,Randy,"Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?!
"
9,14,Group,"Yeah! That's right! Right!
"
9,14,Boy,"Your dad doesn't drink either?
"
9,14,Stan,"No, my dad doesn't drink.
"
9,14,Boy,"Does that mean we're friends? 
"
9,14,Randy,"'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.
"
9,14,Michael,"Sure Randy, go ahead.
"
9,14,Randy,"I'm Randy and I'm an alcoholic.
"
9,14,Group,"Hi Randy.
"
9,14,Randy,"But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now! 
"
9,14,Field Reporter,"An update from the bleeding Virgin Mary statue!
"
9,14,Randy,"Oh wait. Sh sh. Hold on a second, gang. 
"
9,14,Field Reporter,"Earlier today, the new pope, Pope Benedict the 16th himself, visited the statue here in Bailey to witness the miracle firsthand.  It was an amazing sight to behold as Pope Benedict made his way through the throngs of people.
"
9,14,Cardinal Mallory,"Right this way, Your Holiness.
"
9,14,Field Reporter,"The pope then examined the statue closely.  After witnessing the phenomenon firsthand, the pope then cleaned himself off and then declared that the bleeding Virgin Mary statue is not a miracle!
"
9,14,Randy,"What?
"
9,14,Field Reporter,"Having investigated closely, the pope determined that the blood was not coming from the Virgin Mary's ass, but rather, from her vagina. And the pope said quote, ""A chick bleeding out her vagina is no miracle. Chicks bleed out their vagina's all the time.""  Back to you, Tom.
"
9,14,Tom,"Thanks, Edward, that's a very shocking report...
"
9,14,Randy,"That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease!  Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters!  Come ON! Let's GO!
"
9,14,Michael,"Randy, uh what are you doing?
"
9,14,Randy,"You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!
"
9,14,Man 10,"I'm, I'm, I'm powerless too!
"
9,14,Man 11,"Yeah me too!
"
9,14,Man 10,"Get me seven martinis!
"
9,14,Man 12,"Jack and Coke!
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, Dad, Stop!
"
9,14,Randy,"I'm sorry, son! I'm off the wagon!
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue.
"
9,14,Randy,"But the statue wasn't a miracle!
"
9,14,Stan,"Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own.
"
9,14,Randy,"You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I can force myself to never drink again. 
"
9,14,Stan,"No!
"
9,14,Randy,"No??
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.
"
9,14,Randy,"But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing.
"
9,14,Stan,"Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. 
"
9,14,Randy,"How did I manage to raise such a smart kid?
"
9,14,Stan,"I've had a great teacher.
"
9,14,Randy,"Thanks son.
