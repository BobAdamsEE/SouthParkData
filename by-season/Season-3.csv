3,1,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people  for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame , but please, give her your full attention.  Go ahead.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison.  How are we all doing today?!  I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?! 
"
3,1,Mr. Garrison,"Eric Cartman, you say ""excuse me""!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Okay.
"
3,1,Mr. Garrison,"Go ahead.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Children, we are a national choir called, ""Getting Gay With Kids!"" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!
"
3,1,Kenny,"(This sounds fucking screwed.) 
"
3,1,Mr. Garrison,"Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!!  Go ahead.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir  where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest.
"
3,1,Choir Boy,"Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year?
"
3,1,Choir Girl,"That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen  is made in the rainforest. 
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"So, who wants to join the fun??
"
3,1,Cartman,"What if you don't have any rhythm?
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Excuse me?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Shut up, fatass!
"
3,1,Stan,"Choirs suck.
"
3,1,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!!  Go ahead.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, uh, that's all, really.  So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. 
"
3,1,Mr. Garrison,"All right, that does it!!
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man!  You get sent here every day, Craig!
"
3,1,Craig,"I know.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Why can't you behave?
"
3,1,Craig,"...I don't know.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"What do you have to say for yourself?!  Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh-  Did you just flip me off?
"
3,1,Craig,"No.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh-  There! You just flipped me off again!
"
3,1,Craig,"No I didn't.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next!  Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric. 
"
3,1,Kyle,"Hey, Craig.
"
3,1,Eric,"Ey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch!
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? ""The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-""
"
3,1,Stan,"It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, young man, ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Well, guess what, boys? I think that ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you.
"
3,1,Stan,"What?!
"
3,1,Kyle,"You can't do that! 
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)  (I mean, 'Oh.') 
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"I think this will be very good for you 
"
3,1,Stan,"But we don't even care about the rainforest.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"And that's exactly why you need to go!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.
"
3,1,Sheila,"Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints.
"
3,1,Sheila,"Oh, I didn't realize.
"
3,1,Choir Boy,"Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.
"
3,1,Stan,"Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!
"
3,1,Sharon,"Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. 
"
3,1,Stan,"Nooo-ho! 
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Whoopee.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Yeah, pretty much.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo.
"
3,1,Choir Girl,"My name's Kelly.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(My name's Kenny.)
"
3,1,Kelly,"Lenny?
"
3,1,Kenny,"(No, it's Kenny.)
"
3,1,Kelly,"Johnny?
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Kenny!)
"
3,1,Kelly,"Oh. 
"
3,1,Choir Girl,"Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography.
"
3,1,Cartman,"The nightmare begins.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica.  Oh! This is so exciting!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?!  Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, sit down!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Argh! That's just so untrue.)
"
3,1,Kelly,"Your family isn't poor? 
"
3,1,Cartman,"Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!
"
3,1,Redheaded Prostitute,"What are chu looking at, man?
"
3,1,Middle Prostitute,"Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Okay.  Kugheek! 
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, SIT DOWN!
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-
"
3,1,Cartman,"Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"All right, that does it!  Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!
"
3,1,Cartman,"I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.
"
3,1,Kelly,"Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Uh-huh.) 
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-
"
3,1,Cartman,"I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Why?
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Eh-heheh!
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow.
"
3,1,El Presidente,"¿Qué?
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?
"
3,1,El Presidente,"¿Qué?
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"We're the group singing for the ""Save The Rainforest"" summit tomorrow?  Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now.  Children, do any of you speak Spanish?  Don't you dare! 
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Sorry I'm late.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, no problem.  Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien?
"
3,1,El Presidente,"¡O! ¡O! Save The Rainforest.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Yeess!
"
3,1,El Presidente,"Pablo los llevará en un tur de la jungla. 
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. 
"
3,1,El Presidente,"¿Qué?
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin.
"
3,1,Kelly,"Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, I think so.)
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. 
"
3,1,The Tape,"Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
There's a place that is magical, and full of rain.
But now it needs help, because it is in pain.
Cleaning the earth is a mighty big chore
We're spreading awareness like never before!
Getting Gay With Kids is here! 
To spread the word and bring you cheer
Let's save the rainforest! What do you say?!
Being an activist is totally gay!
Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
There'll be nothing but rainforests covering the entire world!
World!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's save the rainforest! It's totally gay!
It's totally gay!
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Thanks!
"
3,1,Cartman,"I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
"
3,1,Kyle,"Fuck off, Cartman!
"
3,1,Stan,"No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
"
3,1,Kyle,"No! That's a stereotype.
"
3,1,Stan,"Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. 
"
3,1,Pablo,"This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!
"
3,1,Kyle,"God-damn, it's hot out here!
"
3,1,Stan,"Aaah! Snake!
"
3,1,Kyle,"No, dude. That's a branch.
"
3,1,Stan,"Oh.  Aaah! Snake!
"
3,1,Kyle,"No. That's the same branch again.
"
3,1,Stan,"Oh.
"
3,1,Pablo,"The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We here this a million times back up in the States.
"
3,1,Pablo,"Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys.  Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest.
"
3,1,Kelly,"Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? 
"
3,1,Cartman,"Bad! Bad monkey! 
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, what the heck are you doing?? 
"
3,1,Cartman,"I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, ""Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!"" and I smack him on the head!
"
3,1,Pablo,"And here is a three-toed sloth. 
"
3,1,Cartman,"It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Respect my authoritah!
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!
"
3,1,Kids,"YEAH!
"
3,1,Choir Boy,"I wish we could have seen the Yanogapa.
"
3,1,Kyle,"What's the Yanogapa?
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!
"
3,1,Stan,"AAAAAAA! 
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Stanley, what is it?
"
3,1,Stan,"SNAAAKE! 
"
3,1,Pablo,"Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature.
"
3,1,Stan,"AAAAAAA! 
"
3,1,Pablo,"What's the matter, little boy?
"
3,1,Cartman,"He's a little wuss, what's it look like? 
"
3,1,Stan,"I'm just a-scared of snakes.
"
3,1,Pablo,"Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it.  Oh!!  Agh.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh my God!! 
"
3,1,Cartman,"Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Jesus Christ, is he dead?! 
"
3,1,Stan,"Dude!
"
3,1,Kyle,"My guess would be 'yes.'
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, no! God, no, no!  Don't panic, children.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! 
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Maybe we came from that way.  No, nno. Let's try this way. 
"
3,1,Kelly,"Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Yeah. Everything is fine.)
"
3,1,Kelly,"That's good. Can I tell you something?
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Okay.)
"
3,1,Kelly,"I think I like you. 
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Really?!)
"
3,1,Kelly,"Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Oh, that's great!)
"
3,1,Kelly,"No, that's not good.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(That's not good?)
"
3,1,Kelly,"No. See, if I start to like you too much,  I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country.  Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again.  And that would devastate me.  So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! 
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Aaaargh!)
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?
"
3,1,A Boy,"I'm not.
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Who's not?!
"
3,1,A Boy,"Me.
"
3,1,Kelly,"Benny, will you hold my hand?  I don't want to get emotionally attached, though.
"
3,1,Stan,"Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley.
"
3,1,El Presidente,"Bueno, bueno. Pongan el arcoiris al lado de las tortugas muertas. (Put the rainbow next to the picture of dying sea turtles.) 
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente)
"
3,1,El Presidente,"¿Qué tal? ¿Está todo bien? (Oh hello. Is everything going okay?)
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)
"
3,1,El Presidente,"¡¿QUÉ?! (WHAT?!)
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)
"
3,1,El Presidente,"¡¿Está bromeando, Mackey?! ¡¡¡Más de cien mil personas atenderan este evento!!! ¡¿Y me dice usted que no tendré a mis chiquitos lindos para que les canten?! (You've got to be kidding!! I have over a hundred thousand people coming to this event!!! Are you telling me that I have no darling little kids to sing to them?!)
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llegá- llegáran. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)
"
3,1,Kyle,"Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
"
3,1,Kelly,"We are?
"
3,1,Choir Teacher,"Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh, really? Could you brush it off? 
"
3,1,Kyle,"Um, no.
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!!  Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here.  Oh my God!! 
"
3,1,Kyle,"Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
"
3,1,Kelly,"Me, too! 
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-
"
3,1,Kyle,"Aaaaa! There's a dude here! 
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost.  Cah heh, can you help us?
"
3,1,Soldier,"¿Qué?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. 
"
3,1,Stan,"I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Y taco.
"
3,1,Kyle,"I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype.  Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over! 
"
3,1,Stan,"This doesn't look very safe.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Now kids, let's be a bit more ""open-minded."" I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a ""people's army."" They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government.  Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?
"
3,1,People's Army Leader,"Who are you?!
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest.  We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San José?  Um...  Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift.. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song 
"
3,1,Kids,"Honh. 
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography.  Oh, Kyle, please! 
"
3,1,People's Army Leader,"Enough! 
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts.
"
3,1,People's Army Leader,"We're not getting gay with any kids, okay?
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?
"
3,1,People's Army Leader,"Heehee yes, we have a phone. It's right over there next to the 12-person jacuzzi.  Now, get out of here before we kill you!
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?
"
3,1,Kyle,"Hey!
"
3,1,People's Army Leader,"You white Americans make me sick!  You waste food, oil, and everything else because you're so rich, and then you tell the rest of the world to save the rainforest because you like its pretty flowers.
"
3,1,People's Army Leader,"¡Rapido, rapido! 
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Run, children, run! 
"
3,1,El Presidente,"¡¿Donde putos está el coro?! ¡El espectáculo comienza pronto! (Where the hell is our choir?! The show is supposed to start soon!)
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estáran aqui. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Hello?? Anybody?? Help??
"
3,1,Choir Boy,"Wow, look at the pretty flower. 
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay? 
"
3,1,Jake,"Aaaah. Ugh, help!
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Ga-ow! 
"
3,1,Kelly,"I wanna go home!  I hate the rainforest!
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.) 
"
3,1,Kelly,"Oh Lenny, hold me.  No, I can't get attached.  Oh, but I do like you.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Well, I like you-)
"
3,1,Kelly,"Oh, but you're only going to leave me.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Oh, God damn it!)
"
3,1,Short Reporter,"We're here live in San José, Costa Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans have gathered for the Save the Rain Forest summit. Everyone is here so they can feel good about themselves, and act like they aren't the ones responsible for the rainforest's peril.
"
3,1,Slim Reporter,"That's right, Bob, and of course the main attraction today is the darling kids' choir, ""Getting Gay With Kids,"" all of whom must be backstage preparing at this very moment.
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job!  Aaaah!
"
3,1,Cartman,"This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Eric, where are you going?
"
3,1,Cartman,"I'm going this way!
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Look: you can stay over nyah , but I'm going over nyah. 
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Young man, I have had it!!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Nononono! You nyah, me nyah!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home.
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Good! You deserve to die, you little bastard!  Eric, we have to stay together!
"
3,1,Cartman,"God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-  Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! 
"
3,1,Stan,"Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Yeah. It happened once before.
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
"
3,1,Foreman,"What are you doing here, little boy?
"
3,1,Cartman,"I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
"
3,1,Foreman,"Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Food! I have to have food! 
"
3,1,Foreman,"Oh my God! Get this child some food, quick!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Chicken wings. 
"
3,1,Foreman,"Chicken wings!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Medium spicy. 
"
3,1,Crowd,"Start the show! Start the show! Start the show!
"
3,1,El Presidente,"La gente está ansiosa. Dentro de poco, se alborotan y empiezan a tirar chorchadas. (The activists are getting anxious. They will start throwing things soon.)
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Estoy seguro que llegáran. Eh-solo poquito mas de tiempo, ¿mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time)
"
3,1,El Presidente,"Bueno, voy a entretenerlos con mis chistes de Polacos.  (Well, I will try and amuse them with my Polish Jokes.)
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Mbien.
"

3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're never going to make the festival!
"
3,1,Stan,"Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke? 
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Let's go, quickly! 
"
3,1,Kyle,"Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Children, it's the Yanogapa.  Do not be afraid. We are not here to tear down your rainforest.

"
3,1,Stan,"We're sinking.
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"It's quicksand, people! 
"
3,1,Stan,"All we ever heard growing up was, ""Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile""!
"
3,1,Kyle,"Yeah! Fragile my ass!
"
3,1,Kelly,"Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care! 
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Kelly, you said it!) 
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Okay. Just what the heck is going on here, people?  AAAAA!!
"
3,1,Kelly,"Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"All right, that does it!!  Goddamn stupid-ass rainforest!! This place fucking sucks!!  I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!
"
3,1,Stan,"Oh, now she figures it out.
"

"
3,1,Kids,"HOORAY!!
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Hooray, children!
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"How did you know where we were?
"
3,1,Foreman,"Your little friend helped me out.
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Eric?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment?
"
3,1,Foreman,"We're clearing out big sections of the rainforest for a lumberyard.
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Really?  That's great!!
"
3,1,Foreman,"You mean, you don't mind?
"
3,1,Miss Stevens,"Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing!
"
3,1,Foreman,"That's swell!
"
3,1,Kelly,"Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Okay. I can do that.)  (Christ!) 
"
3,1,Kelly,"Aaaah! Lenny! No! 
"
3,1,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
3,1,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
3,1,Kelly,"Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?!
"
3,1,Stan,"They did.
"
3,1,Kelly,"Who's ""they""?!
"
3,1,Stan,"You know, ""they.""
"
3,1,Kyle,"They're... they're bastards.
"
3,1,Kelly,"Well don't just stand there, help him!!
"
3,1,Kyle,"What?
"
3,1,Stan,"Help ...him?
"
3,1,Kelly,"Aaagh!  Come on, Benny! Breathe!  Breathe, you son of a bitch!

"
3,1,The New Lyrics,"Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
There's a place called the rainforest; it truly sucks ass.
Let's knock it all down and get rid of it fast.
You say, ""Save the rainforest,"" but what do you know?
You've never been to the rainforest before.
Getting Gay With Kids is here! 
To tell you things you might not like to hear. 
You only fight these causes 'cause caring sells.
All you activists can go fuck yourselves!
"
3,1,Male Activist,"That was so inspiring.
"
3,1,Female Activist,"What a wonderful message.
"
3,1,"The New Lyrics, part II","Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
Each year, the Rainforest is responsible for over three thousand deaths from accidents, attacks or illnesses.
There'll be no more rainforests left in the entire world!
There are over seven hundred things in the Rainforest that cause cancer.
World!
Join the fight now and help stop the Rainforest before it's too late.
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's knock down the rainforest! What do you say?!
It's totally gay! It's totally gay!
"
3,2,Stan,"Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?
"
3,2,Kyle,"No, I don't think so.
"
3,2,Kenny,"(How about this?)
"
3,2,Kyle,"No, that's a hair dryer!
"
3,2,Manager,"May I help you find something?
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""?
"
3,2,Manager,"Any what?
"
3,2,Kyle,"I need to get a nurection for my dad.
"
3,2,Manager,"Very funny, boys. Go on, beat it. 
"
3,2,Stan,"Why is that funny?
"
3,2,Kyle,"Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
"
3,2,Stan,"That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
"
3,2,Kenny,"(You guys, take it seriously.)
"
3,2,Kyle,"I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
"
3,2,Man,"What?
"
3,2,Kenny,"(Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)
"
3,2,Cartman,"Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
"
3,2,Kenny,"(Yeah, you guys. Seriously.)
"
3,2,Cartman,"Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
"
3,2,Kenny,"(Ach) 
"
3,2,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
3,2,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
3,2,Cartman,"What the hell happened to him?
"
3,2,Stan,"He just... ignited.
"
3,2,Man,"What happened?
"
3,2,Woman,"I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire. 
"
3,2,Officer Barbrady,"Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room.
"
3,2,Blond Man,"I've heard about this. This is... spontaneous combustion. But it usually only happens to fat people near open flames.
"
3,2,Man 2,"Is it contagious?
"
3,2,Woman,"Am I going to spontaneously combust?
"
3,2,Man 3,"I hope it doesn't happen to me.
"
3,2,Woman,"This is very scary.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
"
3,2,Randy,"...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Right.
"
3,2,Randy,"Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before more people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park. 
"
3,2,Crowd,"Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
"
3,2,Man,"We love you, Randy.
"
3,2,Woman,"Make love to me, Randy. Please!
"
3,2,Randy,"Wow.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!
"
3,2,Randy,"Or else what?
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Exactly!
"
3,2,Stan,"Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh. There seems to be a lot more takething going on, but there it is. Perhaps if more of you attended church on Sundays , the Lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy...
"
3,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, here comes the guilt trip again.
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"Now, let us pray.  Lord, though we have lost Neil Smith to free agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets, still, we hope our beloved Broncos can bring home another Super Bowl championship, and once again bathe in the glory of your light. Amen.
"
3,2,All,"Amen.
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"Let's go
"
3,2,All,"Let's go
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"Broncos
"
3,2,All,"Broncos
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"Let's go Broncos
"
3,2,All,"Broncos, let's go! 
"
3,2,Stan,"Wow, that was short. 
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Well, I'm Jewish.
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you?
"
3,2,Kyle,"I guess not.
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night?
"
3,2,Stan,"The what?
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"Huh?
"
3,2,Kyle,"We'll do it! We'll do it!
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys. 
"
3,2,Kyle,"Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
"
3,2,Stan,"I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.
"
3,2,Tom,"Good night, Jerry.
"
3,2,Jerry,"See ya, Tom. Bye, Helen.
"
3,2,Helen,"Bye, Jer- aaa! 
"
3,2,Jerry,"Oh my God, another one.
"
3,2,Tom,"Helen, no!
"
3,2,Jerry,"What happened?
"
3,2,Man 5,"God must be very angry with us. But why?  How have we angered you, Lord?
"
3,2,Randy,"Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.
"
3,2,Stan,"Dad, where's our Bible?
"
3,2,Randy,"Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.
"
3,2,Stan,"Or else what?
"
3,2,Randy,"Exactly.
"
3,2,Stan,"...What?
"
3,2,Randy,"Right.
"
3,2,Stan,"Where's our Bible?
"
3,2,Randy,"It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?
"
3,2,Kyle,"He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
"
3,2,Randy,"New girlfriend?
"
3,2,Stan,"Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
"
3,2,Randy,"Maybe nothing...  maybe everything.
"
3,2,Stan,"...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. 
"
3,2,Randy,"Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?!
"
3,2,Stan,"Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
"
3,2,Kyle,"This is gonna be fun.
"
3,2,Cartman,"I'm gonna be Jesus!
"
3,2,Kyle,"You're too fat to be Jesus!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Stan should be Jesus.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
3,2,Kyle,"You're such a fat baby!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. 
"
3,2,Kyle,"All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
"
3,2,Randy,"All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Now, walk.  Do you feel hot?
"
3,2,Randy,"Damn it! How come you're not combusting? 
"
3,2,Townsman,"Another one! Another one combusted! 
"
3,2,Randy,"No! Has she been doing anything odd?
"
3,2,Townsman,"No, she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house.
"
3,2,Randy,"Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
"
3,2,Randy,"No! I think I might have it.
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little ""nervous"" about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh?
"
3,2,A few people,"Yeah.
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"Well, on this blessed Friday let us give thanks for stuff, and things.  Lord, is it so much to ask that you not let us suddenly burst into flame for no apparent reason? I mean, come on! Amen.  And now, some of our darling local children are going to perform the Stations of the Cross. 
"
3,2,Crowd,"Awww.
"
3,2,Stan,"Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Die! 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
"
3,2,Crowd,"Awww.
"
3,2,Someone,"Phew.
"
3,2,Stan,"Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
"
3,2,Cartman,"This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.
"
3,2,Stan,"And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Peter!
"
3,2,Kyle,"I don't know you, dude.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Mayor.
"
3,2,Randy,"Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Why?
"
3,2,Randy,"Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Girlfriend ==&gt; DEADBoyfriend ==&gt; DEAD Call a town meeting tomorrow.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park.
"
3,2,Crowd,"Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
"
3,2,Man,"We love you, Randy.
"
3,2,Woman,"Make love to me, Randy. Please!
"
3,2,Randy,"Wow. 
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Shmuck!
"
3,2,Stan,"Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
"
3,2,Stan,"Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks.""
"
3,2,Cartman,"Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool. 
"
3,2,Stan,"And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hi, mom. 
"
3,2,Priest Maxi,"Thank you, boys. Blessed be the name of Jesus!
"
3,2,Crowd,"It's a great name, isn't it? 
"
3,2,Kyle,"Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Up your ass with broken glass!
"
3,2,Stan,"This spot looks good. 
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah. That looks pretty good.
"
3,2,Stan,"Okay, cool. See you, Cartman.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! 
"
3,2,Stan,"Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah, me too.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Well, get me down from here!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
"
3,2,Cartman,"What?!
"
3,2,Stan,"Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Then I can give it to my dad. 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  Okay, I'm getting pissed now!  God!
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?
"
3,2,Randy,"The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.
"
3,2,Townsman,"You mean, all we have to do is fart and we won't explode?
"
3,2,Randy,"Exactly. 
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes.
"
3,2,Crowd,"Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! 
"
3,2,Man,"We love you, Randy.
"
3,2,Old Woman,"Make love to me, Randy. Please!
"
3,2,Stan,"Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.
"
3,2,Stan,"Wow, he died.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hey, there you guys are!
"
3,2,Stan,"Cartman??
"
3,2,Cartman,"You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
"
3,2,Kyle,"How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!
"
3,2,Cartman,"You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!
"
3,2,Stan,"Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.
"
3,2,Cartman,"...Really?
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
"
3,2,Cartman,"...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet!  Dude, superpowers are sweet.
"
3,2,Mr. Mackey,"Hi, boys.
"
3,2,"Stan, Kyle","Hi, Mr. Mackey.
"
3,2,Mr. Mackey,"Have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust?
"
3,2,Kyle,"We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!
"
3,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well, let me show you, just to be sure, m'kay?  Hmm, come on. Be good, now. 
"
3,2,Kyle,"Jesus Christ! 
"
3,2,Stan,"(Sick, dude!)
"
3,2,Mr. Mackey,"I had a steak wrapped with bacon last night. 
"
3,2,Kyle,"(Dude, I think you pooed a lot.)
"
3,2,Mr. Mackey,"So, you boys understand you have to do that regularly, oh-mkay? 
"
3,2,Stan,"(Okay, okay, just go away!) 
"
3,2,Kyle,"God, that was not cool at all, dude!
"
3,2,Liane,"Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?
"
3,2,Stan,"Uh. We've been taking care of him.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.
"
3,2,Liane,"Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples.
"
3,2,Stan,"Apples?
"
3,2,Liane,"Yes. Apples.  Ahapples, get it? 
"
3,2,Stan,"(Dude!)
"
3,2,Kyle,"(Sick!)
"
3,2,Liane,"Stinky apples. See you, boys. 
"
3,2,Stan,"(I don't think I like this new law.)
"
3,2,Liane,"Squeaker! 
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"And so I declare today Randy Marsh Day, where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion. Gentlemen? 
"
3,2,Bearded Man,"You're the best, Randy!
"
3,2,Randy,"I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.
"
3,2,Kyle,"It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
"
3,2,Stan,"Yeah.
"
3,2,Cartman,"You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!
"
3,2,Officer Barbrady,"Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-
"
3,2,Cartman,"Officer Barbrady! 
"
3,2,Officer Barbrady,"T. T is for turtle.  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur...
"
3,2,Cartman,"Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch!  Huh, I'm gonna die up here.
"
3,2,Announcer,"We now return to the 42nd Annual Nobel Prize Awards. Here again your host, Whoopi Goldberg. 
"
3,2,Whoopi,"Republicans are so stupid.  I hate Republicans.  Republicans are so stupid.  And now, here to present the Nobel Prize for Science is Nick Nolte 
"
3,2,Nick Nolte,"Science is good. Science is very important. This year's nominees are: Herald R. Pinkerton, for his further development of the grand unified theory of physics.Randy Marsh, for his formulated break-wind theory of spontaneous combustion.And Alphonse Mephesto for his seven-assed Galapagos turtle.And the Nobel Prize goes to:  Randy Marsh, for the theory of spontaneous fart things. 
"
3,2,Mephesto,"No! No, this can't be!
"
3,2,Randy,"Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!
"
3,2,Mephesto,"Fixed! Fixed! That was supposed to be my award, Kevin. I'll get him for this. Mark my words.
"
3,2,Stan,"Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.
"
3,2,Gerald,"I'm sorry, honey.
"
3,2,Sheila,"It's okay,  I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over.
"
3,2,Gerald,"What?!
"
3,2,Sheila,"I'm just kidding.
"
3,2,Gerald,"Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!
"
3,2,Sheila,"Why?
"
3,2,Gerald,"Why?! 
"
3,2,Sheila,"Kyle. 
"
3,2,Kyle,"Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
"
3,2,Gerald,"Huh?
"
3,2,Kyle,"Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 
"
3,2,Sheila,"We have a very strange little boy, Gerald.
"
3,2,Stan,"Dude, he's still not dead.
"
3,2,Cartman,"You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
"
3,2,Kyle,"She's not worried about you.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.
"
3,2,Stan,"That's not your mom calling!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.
"
3,2,Kyle,"How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
"
3,2,Cartman,"You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!
"
3,2,Stan,"He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.
"
3,2,Stan,"Hey, yeah! 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my ""I hate Stand and Kyle"" song?! Ahem.I hate Stan and KyleI seriously hate Stan and Kyle...
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more?
"
3,2,Aide 2,"It's already on full.
"
3,2,Randy,"You wanted to see me, Mayor?
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it.
"
3,2,Randy,"I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.
"
3,2,Randy,"Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, all right. Name your price.
"
3,2,Randy,"Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Done. Just find out what's happening.
"
3,2,Randy,"Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly. 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hey you guys. Seriously. 
"
3,2,Chef,"What the-?  Oh, what now?!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Chef! Chef!
"
3,2,Chef,"Children, what the hell are you doin'?
"
3,2,Cartman,"Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!
"
3,2,Chef,"You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!
"
3,2,Chef,"Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.
"
3,2,Cartman,"What?
"
3,2,Chef,"It's really gonna piss you off.
"
3,2,Cartman,"What?!
"
3,2,Chef,"This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Oh, damnit!
"
3,2,Stan,"Dad, where's the phone book?
"
3,2,Randy,"Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?
"
3,2,Jesus,"Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones.  Caller, you're on the air.
"
3,2,Stan,"Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?
"
3,2,Randy,"Stan?
"
3,2,Jesus,"That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.
"
3,2,Stan,"Oh.
"
3,2,Jesus,"Do you have an opinion on global warming?
"
3,2,Stan,"Uh, it... sucks ass.
"
3,2,Jesus,"Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto.  Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park.
"
3,2,Mephesto,"I most certainly do! The cause of global warming is  Randy Marsh!  It was Marsh's theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want. Now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer. We are all doomed to die!
"
3,2,Randy,"Awww crap.
"
3,2,Townsman,"Go get him!
"
3,2,Townsman 1,"We want answers!
"
3,2,Townsman 2,"You've killed us all!
"
3,2,Townsman 3,"Someone's got to pay!
"
3,2,Woman,"It's out of control.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Boy, they're really pissed.
"
3,2,Randy,"Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me. 
"
3,2,Randy,"Hey!
"
3,2,Townsman 4,"You killed us all!
"
3,2,Townsman 5,"Shove that Nobel prize up your ass! 
"
3,2,Stan,"Oh my God, what's going on?
"
3,2,Townsman 6,"Now we either hold in our farts and spontaneously combust, o-o-or we let our farts out and kill our entire planet. Well I, for one, am not farting anymore! 
"
3,2,Randy,"Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.
"
3,2,Townsman 7,"We don't want your solutions, phony!
"
3,2,Townsman 8,"Give me that!  Yeah!
"
3,2,Townsman 9,"Damn you Marsh! Get out of town!
"
3,2,Townsman 10,"You fraud! 
"
3,2,Randy,"Mr. Garrison, help me!
"
3,2,Mr. Garrison,"I, I do not know you, sir.
"
3,2,Townsman 11,"Up your-
"
3,2,Townsman 12,"Arrn!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah, take that!
"
3,2,Stan,"Dude, that's my dad!
"
3,2,Kyle,"...Oh, yeah. Sorry.
"
3,2,Anchor,"The spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more people go back to holding in all their farts.  Meanwhile, the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion. As we all know, the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier today and he had this to say:
"
3,2,Randy,"I-I don't know what to say.
"
3,2,Anchor,"What an asshole! I hate that guy, and so do you. And now, on to the weather. It's fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh, son of a bitch!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Dude, those people are pissed!
"
3,2,Stan,"I know, huh?
"
3,2,Kyle,"Where's your dad?
"
3,2,Stan,"He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.
"
3,2,Radio Talk Show Host,"Still more up next from the heat wave caused by Randy Marsh. A giant glacier is melting above South Park and the entire town is doomed. And now, these messages.
"
3,2,Bob Dole,"Having a hard time with male potency?  Well, I don't, and I'm Bob Dole. What's wrong with you? Christ, I'm Bob Dole and I can get it up. 
"
3,2,Blonde,"Are you a lawyer?
"
3,2,Gerald,"Yes.
"
3,2,Blonde,"We want to sue Randy Marsh.
"
3,2,Gerald,"Why?
"
3,2,Blonde,"He gave us skin cancer.
"
3,2,Brunette,"Yeah. He put the hole in the ozone, and now we have skin cancer all over our hot bodies. Look. 
"
3,2,Stan,"What are you doing, dad?
"
3,2,Randy,"Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.
"
3,2,Stan,"No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!
"
3,2,Randy,"Hm. Really?
"
3,2,Stan,"Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!
"
3,2,Randy,"Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.
"
3,2,Stan,"Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.
"
3,2,Randy,"What?
"
3,2,Stan,"See, at first, Jesus was all like, ""Why me?"" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.""
"
3,2,Randy,"You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.
"
3,2,Stan,"It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. 
"
3,2,Kyle,"Dude, that was Star Trek again.
"
3,2,Stan,"Huh?
"
3,2,Kyle,"""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan.
"
3,2,Stan,"Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?
"
3,2,Randy,"All right. Now, let's get to work.
"
3,2,"You And Me, Girl","I've been telling everybody that you're my girl Cause I'm not one to be shy You don't have to go with me if you don't want to, just Tell everybody I'm your guy You and me, girl, it's foreverSha la la la la laaaI've been telling everybody that you're my girl,Cause I'm not one to be shy I've been telling everybody that you're my girl,Cause I'm not one to be shy You don't have to go with me if you don't want to, justTell everybody I'm your guy You and me, girl, it's foreverSha la la la la laaaYou and me, girl, forever and everYou and me, girl, forever and everYou and me, girl, forever and ever... 
"
3,2,Stan,"Dad. Dad! 
"
3,2,Randy,"Wow!
"
3,2,Stan,"Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
"
3,2,Randy,"...Right, right right.
"
3,2,Gerald,"Kyle, where's your mother?
"
3,2,Kyle,"She's upstairs.
"
3,2,Gerald,"Well, I have something to give to her!  Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hello-o.
"
3,2,Townsman 13,"Look! There he is!
"
3,2,Townsman 14,"Get him!
"
3,2,Randy,"Uh. Please, everyone- 
"
3,2,Townsman 15,"You're a dead man, Marsh!
"
3,2,Randy,"Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.
"
3,2,Townsman 16,"Could I borrow one of your rocks?
"
3,2,Randy,"It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.
"
3,2,Townsman 17,"Huh? 
"
3,2,Randy,"I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.
"
3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all. 
"
3,2,Stan,"See? My dad is the coolest after all.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Well, my dad is, too.
"
3,2,Stan,"Cartman!
"
3,2,Kyle,"I forgot all about him. 
"
3,2,Stan,"He's been up there for like, three weeks.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Wow!
"
3,2,Stan,"That's amazing!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?
"
3,2,Cartman,"Get me down from here!
"
3,2,Stan,"Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
"
3,2,Cartman,"Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Mom, please can we just leave?
"
3,3,Liane,"You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.
"
3,3,Cartman,"But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
"
3,3,Liane,"You're not fat, you're big-boned.
"
3,3,Cartman,"That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.
"
3,3,Doctor's assistant,"Eric Cartman. 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Weak. 
"
3,3,Optometrist,"Hello, Eric.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hi, Doctor Lout.
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"How's my little piggy today?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"I just say that because you're my little buddy.
"
3,3,Cartman,"I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"Hop up on the chair.  Don't break it now!
"
3,3,Cartman,"God damn it!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing.  All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Yes.
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"All right, read them out for me.
"
3,3,Cartman,"I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! Mom!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence.  I do not know how that happened.  ""I am a little piggy."" Wow! What are the odds of that?  All right, let's get down to business, shall we? 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?
"
3,3,Cartman,"They look exactly the same.
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"Just pick one. Or two.
"
3,3,Cartman,"I don't know, two!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"Okay. One, or two? One, or two?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Uh, one.
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"One, or two? One, or two?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Two.
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"No! The answer is one, piggy! One! 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ow! I hate you!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests.
"
3,3,Kyle,"I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
"
3,3,Stan,"Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.
"
3,3,Kenny,"{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.} 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hey dudes.
"
3,3,Stan,"Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? 
"
3,3,Cartman,"My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Why?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
"
3,3,Stan,"Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hey, yeah!  Ow!
"
3,3,The Boys,"Hey Chef!
"
3,3,White Chef,"Hello there, children.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.
"
3,3,White Chef,"It's time for lunch-e-roo
"
3,3,Stan,"Where's Chef?
"
3,3,White Chef,"Chef quit.
"
3,3,The Boys,"What?!
"
3,3,White Chef,"Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Derp. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Mr. Derp?
"
3,3,Mr. Derp,"When I'm in the kitchen, you never know what nutty things are gonna happen. If you like Chef, you're gonna love Mr. Derp.  Ooo! Derp!  Derp! O-hoh wasn't that silly kids? 
"
3,3,Stan,"Why did Chef quit?
"
3,3,Mr. Derp,"Aren't I a great character? My antics go right to the funny bone.  Oh, I don't feel so good.  Derp!
"
3,3,Stan,"Could you just hand us some food please?
"
3,3,Mr. Derp,"Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
"
3,3,Kyle,"Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
"
3,3,Stan,"Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
"
3,3,Cartman,"I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ow!
"
3,3,Chef,"Oh! Hello there, children!
"
3,3,Stan,"Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.
"
3,3,Chef,"Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Yeah, but we didn't believe them.
"
3,3,Chef,"Well, it's true.
"
3,3,Stan,"But why? Why would you quit?
"
3,3,Chef,"Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.
"
3,3,Stan,"So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
"
3,3,Chef,"No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked.
"
3,3,Stan,"Talked?!
"
3,3,Chef,"Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years  and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.
"
3,3,Woman,"Oh! What darling little children.
"
3,3,Chef,"Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.
"
3,3,Stan,"That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!
"
3,3,Chef,"Children, Veronica is moving in with me.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Moving in?!
"
3,3,Chef,"I'm in love.
"
3,3,Boys,"Love?!
"
3,3,Veronica,"Oh, you knight. 
"
3,3,Stan,"What the hell is going on?!
"
3,3,Chef,"Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
"
3,3,Veronica,"Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you.
"
3,3,Kyle,"But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
"
3,3,Chef,"Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.
"
3,3,Veronica,"What's the problem?
"
3,3,Cartman,"My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
"
3,3,Veronica,"Oh, I know just the song for you.
There's got to be a morning after
if we can hold on to the night
"
3,3,Chef,"We have a chance to find the sunshine.
"
3,3,"Chef, Veronica","Let's keep on looking for the light.
"
3,3,Kyle,"This... is insane. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"That bitch!
"
3,3,Stan,"She's stealing Chef from us.
"
3,3,Kyle,"He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
"
3,3,Stan,"Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Yeah, so?
"
3,3,Stan,"...Yeah, screw that bitch.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Bitch, I hate that bitch!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
"
3,3,Stan,"Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Good idea.
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"All right, we got the test results back, piggy-
"
3,3,Cartman,"Stop calling me piggy!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
"
3,3,Cartman,"So, what does that mean?
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better.
"
3,3,Cartman,"All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new. 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses.
"
3,3,Cartman,"I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"That's why we have the little stapler. 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ow! Son of a bitch!
"
3,3,Kyle,"They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Dude! Just take them off!
"
3,3,Cartman,"I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.
"
3,3,Receptionist,"Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?
"
3,3,Stan,"We wanna talk to Chef.
"
3,3,Receptionist,"Chef?
"
3,3,Kyle,"He's a big guy, with a beard.
"
3,3,Stan,"And a chef hat.
"
3,3,Kenny,"{And a real huge dick.}
"
3,3,Receptionist,"Oh! The black guy!
"
3,3,Stan,"Huh?
"
3,3,Receptionist,"Third cubicle on the left  Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Uh, yeah, sure sure.
"
3,3,Receptionist,"Wow! You really got fat.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ey!
"
3,3,Chef,"Hello there, children.
"
3,3,Kids,"Hey, Chef.
"
3,3,Chef,"Eric, you got glasses!
"
3,3,Stan,"Chef, you have to dump the bitch!
"
3,3,Chef,"Huh?
"
3,3,Kyle,"We need you, Chef.
"
3,3,Man,"Hey, Chef-o, we're gonna run down to the office supply store and get some leather holders for our pagers, you wanna come?
"
3,3,Chef,"You bet! 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Chef, this place isn't you!
"
3,3,Chef,"Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.
"
3,3,Stan,"But we don't like her.
"
3,3,Chef,"Why not??
"
3,3,Stan,"I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.
"
3,3,Chef,"Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.
"
3,3,Kyle,"No way, dude!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.
"
3,3,Chef,"That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
"
3,3,Chef,"You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?
"
3,3,Kids,"Okay!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Chef should be here any minute.
"
3,3,Stan,"Dude! He bailed on us!
"
3,3,Kyle,"I can't believe it!
"
3,3,Stan,"Come on! We're going to his house! 
"
3,3,Chef,"Oh! Uh, hello there, children.
"
3,3,Kyle,"All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
"
3,3,Chef,"Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot.
"
3,3,Stan,"You forgot!
"
3,3,Chef,"Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
"
3,3,Veronica,"Hello, children!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?
"
3,3,Chef,"Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married. 
"
3,3,Stan,"Oh no! No nononononono!
"
3,3,Chef,"My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too.
"
3,3,Veronica,"This is so wonderful! Let's sing! 
There's got to be a morning after.
"
3,3,Chef,"If we can hold on through the night.
We have a chance to find the sunshine.
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review.  Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant.  Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Sure.
"
3,3,Stan,"Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so.
"
3,3,Kyle,"All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, the old succubus syndrome.
"
3,3,Stan,"What's a succubus?
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.
"
3,3,Kyle,"That's it!
"
3,3,Stan,"Yeah!
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love.
"
3,3,Kyle,"This is totally what's happening!
"
3,3,Stan,"Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say ""get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!""
"
3,3,Kyle,"Thanks, Mr. Garrison.
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Sure, kids. 
"
3,3,Mr. Hat,"You're not fooling anyone!
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
"
3,3,Stan,"Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. 
"
3,3,Liane,"There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Oh, no!
"
3,3,Liane,"Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.
"
3,3,Liane,"Now, hon.
"
3,3,Cartman,"But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
"
3,3,Chef's dad,"Hello there, children.
"
3,3,Stan,"Who are you?
"
3,3,Chef's dad,"I'm Chef's father. We just flew in for the wedding.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
"
3,3,Chef's dad,"Well, come on in. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"There he is! 
"
3,3,Stan,"Chef, we have to talk to you!
"
3,3,Chef,"Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back. 
"
3,3,Chef's dad,"Well, aren't you crackers just cute as the dickens?
"
3,3,Stan,"You're Chef's parents?
"
3,3,Chef's mom,"Yes, all his life.
"
3,3,Kyle,"We have to talk to him!
"
3,3,Chef's dad,"Well, he should be out now directly.
"
3,3,Chef's mom,"Oh, he's so excited about the wedding now.
"
3,3,Chef's dad,"Say, would you crackers like to hear about the time we saw the Loch Ness monster?
"
3,3,Stan,"No, that's okay.
"
3,3,Chef's dad,"Ooh, it must've been about seven, eight years ago. Me and the little lady was out on this boat, you see, all alone at night, when all of a sudden this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the paleolithic era, comes out of the water.
"
3,3,Chef's mom,"We was so scared, Lord have mercy, I jumped up in the boat and I said ""Thomas, what on earth is that creature?!""
"
3,3,Thomas,"It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-
"
3,3,Chef's mom,"Oh, it was so scary!
"
3,3,Thomas,"and I yelled. I said, ""What do you want from us, monster?!"" And the monster bent down and said, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty."" 
"
3,3,Kyle,"What's tree-fitty?
"
3,3,Thomas,"Three dollars and fifty cents.
"
3,3,Chef's mom,"Tree-fitty.
"
3,3,Stan,"He wanted money?
"
3,3,Thomas,"That's right. I said ""I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!""
"
3,3,Chef's mom,"I gave him a dollar.
"
3,3,Thomas,"She gave him a dollar.
"
3,3,Chef's mom,"I thought he'd go away if I gave him a dollar.
"
3,3,Thomas,"Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"Okay, let's get started. You're here for the liposuction, right? 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hey! You son of a bitch!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"All right. Time to laser me a little piggy. 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh 
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"I bet his mom wishes she could do that.
"
3,3,Thomas,"And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-
"
3,3,Nellie,"August.
"
3,3,Thomas,"August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-
"
3,3,Nellie,"And she was so adorable, with the little pig tails and all.
"
3,3,Thomas,"And she says to me, ""How would you like to buy some cookies?"" And I said ""Well, what kind do you have?"" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-
"
3,3,Nellie,"Raisin oatmeal.
"
3,3,Thomas,"Raisin oatmeal, and I said ""We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?"" And she looks at me and she says, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty.""
"
3,3,Nellie,"...Tree-fitty.
"
3,3,Thomas,"Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.
"
3,3,Nellie,"The Loch Ness monster.
"
3,3,Thomas,"I said, ""Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!"" It said, ""how about just two-fitty?"" I said, ""Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!""
"
3,3,Nellie,"Lord, he was angry.
"
3,3,Thomas,"Damn right, I was angry!
"
3,3,Nellie,"Not you, the monster. He was about to kick your ass.
"
3,3,Thomas,"Aah, shut your mouth, woman!
"
3,3,Stan,"Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?
"
3,3,Thomas,"Sure. That crazy old monster  Now, then the fourth time I saw the...
"
3,3,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
"
3,3,Cartman,"That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
"
3,3,Stan,"Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?
"
3,3,Stan,"Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.
"
3,3,Liane,"Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right? 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Okay. 
"
3,3,Veronica,"Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Aaah! It's the succubus! 
"
3,3,Veronica,"Huh?
"
3,3,Stan,"We know what you are, lady!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
"
3,3,Veronica,"A what?
"
3,3,Stan,"A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
"
3,3,Veronica,"Boys, you know how silly that sounds, don't you?
"
3,3,Kyle,"Well, you are taking Chef from us. 
"
3,3,Veronica,"Boys, come here. I want to explain this to you. I know Chef is your friend, but Chef is a grown man. He has needs you boys can't fulfill. He wants a life with me because I make him happy. Do you understand?
"
3,3,Stan,"I guess.
"
3,3,Veronica,"Good. Oh and boys. Just one more thing. I'm going to marry Chef tomorrow,  And there's not a God-damned thing you can do about it!  Toodle-oo! 
"
3,3,Stan,"Jesus dude! 
"
3,3,Cartman,"What? What happened?
"
3,3,Thomas,"Could I have your attention please?  Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady.  I'm very happy for them both.  Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now.
"
3,3,Chef,"It's okay, pop.
"
3,3,Nellie,"Thomas, you're gonna get me going now. 
"
3,3,Thomas,"Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, ""Poppa, poppa!"" I said ""What do you need, Chef, my boy?"", and he said, ""...I need about tree-fitty.""
"
3,3,Nellie,"...Tree-fitty.
"
3,3,Thomas,"Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, ""Chef, why do you need tree-fitty?"" He said, ""My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it."" I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster!
"
3,3,Nellie,"Oh, it was scary!
"
3,3,Thomas,"I said, ""Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!""
"
3,3,Stan,"Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
"
3,3,Chef,"What?!
"
3,3,Stan,"Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
"
3,3,Veronica,"Children! That hurts my feelings.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
"
3,3,Chef,"All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!
"
3,3,Stan,"Chef, but-
"
3,3,Chef,"No buts, Stan!  I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party. 
"
3,3,Thomas,"So I chased the monster down the street, you see...
"
3,3,Kyle,"I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
"
3,3,Stan,"No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
"
3,3,Stan,"Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
"
3,3,Cartman,"You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.
"
3,3,Stan,"Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
"
3,3,Cartman,"You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power.""
"
3,3,Stan,"What the hell does that mean?
"
3,3,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
3,3,Kenny,"(Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)
"
3,3,Stan,"Right.
"
3,3,Kenny,"(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)
"
3,3,Stan,"Yeah?
"
3,3,Kenny,"(That's what that means!)
"
3,3,Stan,"Oh-hoho!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
"
3,3,Cartman,"If we can hold on to the night.
We've got to find our way together...
"
3,3,Stan,"That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
"
3,3,Kyle,"In three hours.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. 
"
3,3,Stan,"We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? 
"
3,3,Kyle,"He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
"
3,3,Cartman,"What what what?
"
3,3,Stan,"God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.
"
3,3,Cartman,"I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
"
3,3,Thomas,"...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that.
"
3,3,Nellie,"We had taco salad that night.
"
3,3,Thomas,"Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, ""What do you want from me, alien?!"" and do you know what he said?
"
3,3,Nellie,"Tree-fitty.
"
3,3,Thomas,"Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, ""tree-fitty."" And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!
"
3,3,Nellie,"I had just given him tree-fitty the week before.
"
3,3,Thomas,"What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!
"
3,3,Nellie,"He tricked me.
"
3,3,Thomas,"Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty!
"
3,3,Stan,"There she is! 
"
3,3,Stan,"Bitch. Bitch.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Bitch.
"
3,3,Stan,"Bitch.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Dirty bitch.
"
3,3,Stan,"All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Okay. 
"
3,3,Priest Maxi,"Do you, Chef, take this woman as your lawful-wedded wife, to have and to-
"
3,3,Chef,"Iii do!
"
3,3,Nellie,"Aaah, my baby's getting married!
"
3,3,Priest Maxi,"And do you, Veronica, take Chef to be your daddy?
"
3,3,Veronica,"I do!
"
3,3,Priest Maxi,"And now a special sharing of vows through song.
"
3,3,Stan,"Here it goes.
"
3,3,Veronica,"There's got to be a morning after. 
"
3,3,Stan,"Now, Cartman! 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Now, Cartman!!

3,3,Veronica,"I'll take care of them!

"
3,3,Chef,"No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her.
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Poontang's poontang.
"
3,3,Chef,"Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream.
"
3,3,"Stan, Kyle","Hooray! 
"
3,3,Cartman,"What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
"
3,3,Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
3,3,"Stan, Kyle","Hey, Chef!
"
3,3,Chef,"How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots?
"
3,3,Stan,"We'd love them!
"
3,3,Kyle,"It's great to have you back Chef!
"
3,3,Chef,"Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week: Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think it can't get any better.But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.And then you're left with nothing, cause your tinking with your dong.&lt;p&gt;So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon wind!Just play it cool and don't be a fool...
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"And never let poontang come between you and your friend.
"
3,3,Chef,"Daaamn right, Garrison! 
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes doing?
"
3,3,Cartman,"After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"I don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes.
"
3,3,Cartman,"No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"Was he an organ donor?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Eh-sure.
"
3,3,Dr. Lott,"All right, then let's get to work.  Say, you don't have three dollars and fifty cents on you, do you?
"
3,4,Voice,"This is shop class.  My name is Mr. Adler. For the next week, rather than your normal schoolwork, you'll be learning how to make things. Now, does anybody know WHY you're in shop class?  Yes?
"
3,4,Stan,"Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Wrong! You are here because you are America's future!  You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have...  shop class.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Ooooohh.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a-  I have... uh, I have a...
"
3,4,Kyle,"Mr. Adler?
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?
"
3,4,Stan,"Tweek is!
"
3,4,Tweek,"Arrh! No, I'm not!
"
3,4,Kyle,"Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble
"
3,4,Tweek,"Arrrrh!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?
"
3,4,Craig,"No.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we-  Hey! Did you just flip me off?!
"
3,4,Craig,"No.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Yes, you did!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Told ya!
"
3,4,Kyle,"Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.
"
3,4,Stan,"Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.
"
3,4,Voice,"Welcome to home ec.  For the next week, you will be learning how to bake, sew, clean, and make things that are lacy and pretty. 
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Woohooo!) 
"
3,4,Wendy,"I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.
"
3,4,Woman,"That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers.  But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Woohooo!) 
"
3,4,Cartman,"I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? 
"
3,4,Stan,"I don't know. He's such a wuss.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!
"
3,4,Cartman,"You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. 
"
3,4,Stan,"No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Do you wanna bet?
"
3,4,Cartman,"Yeah, I'll bet.
"
3,4,Stan,"How much?
"
3,4,Cartman,"Five bucks.
"
3,4,Stan,"You're on!
"
3,4,Tweek,"Arrh!  
"
3,4,Stan,"Hey Tweek.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Gaarhrhrh!
"
3,4,Stan,"Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
"
3,4,Tweek,"He does?
"
3,4,Stan,"Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?
"
3,4,Tweek,"Why?
"
3,4,Kyle,"Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? 
"
3,4,Tweek,"Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.
"
3,4,Craig,"He did?
"
3,4,Cartman,"Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
"
3,4,Craig,"Why would he say that?
"
3,4,Cartman,"I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
"
3,4,Craig,"Well, I've gotta go over there and-
"
3,4,Cartman,"No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
"
3,4,Craig,"Okay. 
"
3,4,Kyle,"There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Rrrr! What a jerk!
"
3,4,Stan,"He's really got it out for you, dude.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Why?! What did I do?!
"
3,4,Kyle,"So, do you agree to fight him after school?
"
3,4,Tweek,"I guess so.
"
3,4,Stan,"Super. See you there. 
"
3,4,Fiancée,"Catch me, Richard.  I'm so in love with you, Richard.  I made you some cookies, Richard.  Merry Christmas, Richard.  Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever.  Aaaaaaa!  Richard!
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Aaaarr! Uh.  Oh why? Why? 
"
3,4,Stan,"Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Huhuh Huh? Stop screwing around!
"
3,4,Stan,"The bell rang. Can we go?
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed.
"
3,4,Stan,"Come on, you guys. 
"
3,4,Stan,"This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
"
3,4,Cartman,"You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
"
3,4,Kyle,"We'll see!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
"
3,4,Stan,"You're on, fatass! 
"
3,4,Cartman,"Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)
"
3,4,Stan,"How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
"
3,4,Kyle,"Yeah. That's not cool, dude. 
"
3,4,Bebe,"Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow.
"
3,4,Jordan,"Bye, Kenny.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Bye, ladies.) 
"
3,4,Clyde,"Hey, what's going on?
"
3,4,Kyle,"Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
"
3,4,Clyde,"Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.
"
3,4,Kyle,"What?
"
3,4,Token,"Yeah, they left.
"
3,4,Stan,"Aw, hell!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Those sons of bitches!
"
3,4,Clyde,"I guess they don't wanna fight.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 
"
3,4,Stan,"Tweek?
"
3,4,Kyle,"Tweek?
"
3,4,Tweek,"Herr. What do you guys want?
"
3,4,Stan,"How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!
"
3,4,Tweek,"Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Well, Craig showed up.
"
3,4,Tweek,"He did?
"
3,4,Stan,"Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!""
"
3,4,Tweek,"I don't have crooked teeth!
"
3,4,Kyle,"And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!
"
3,4,Tweek,"Everyone in the world?! Rrrr! 
"
3,4,Stan,"Yeah, it was weak.
"
3,4,Tweek,"I'm not a chicken!
"
3,4,Kyle,"Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 
"
3,4,Tweek,"Wait! I'll fight!
"
3,4,Stan,"Tomorrow?
"
3,4,Tweek,"Okay.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
"
3,4,Craig,"Red Racer's on.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!
"
3,4,Craig,"I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.
"
3,4,Craig,"Nope. 
"
3,4,Cartman,"Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.
"
3,4,Craig,"What?! What did he say about Stripe?!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
"
3,4,Craig,"That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?
"
3,4,Craig,"After Red Racer.
"
3,4,Cartman,"After Red Racer, of course.
"
3,4,Richard,"How was school today, son?
"
3,4,Tweek,"Errh!
"
3,4,Richard,"That's great.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??
"
3,4,Richard,"Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met.  You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive.
"
3,4,Mrs. Tweak,"It's true. I was. 
"
3,4,Richard,"Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight. 
"
3,4,Tweek,"Well?
"
3,4,Mrs. Tweak,"Well what, honey?
"
3,4,Tweek,"Nrr. What happened?
"
3,4,Richard,"Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something.
"
3,4,Mrs. Tweak,"Yes, I think that's right.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Rrrrr! You guys never help me!  Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out! 
"
3,4,Craig,"Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow.
"
3,4,Thomas,"With who?
"
3,4,Craig,"Some kid.
"
3,4,Thomas,"Oh.
"
3,4,Mrs. Tucker,"Don't just ""Oh"" him, Thomas!
"
3,4,Craig,"Yeah, don't just ""Oh"" me!
"
3,4,Thomas,"I'll ""Oh"" whoever I want! 
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later.
"
3,4,Pearl,"Richard, aren't you going to invite me in?
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Why?
"
3,4,Pearl,"Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-tempt to make love to me tonight.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on.
"
3,4,Pearl,"Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why?
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts. 
"
3,4,Pearl,"We'll use plastic wrap.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time. 
"
3,4,Fiancée,"Swing me Richard, swing me higher. I wanna touch the sky, Richard.  Richard, I'm here!  Smile.  Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes.  But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you.  Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! It's what I do!  Aaaaaaa!  Richard!  Richard.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Haaarrr!  Aw, God, what am I gonna do? 
"
3,4,Stan,"Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.
"
3,4,Clyde,"Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?
"
3,4,Craig,"I uh...
"
3,4,Cartman,"However long Craig wants it to last.  T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.
"
3,4,Kyle,"He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Shut up, fatass!!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! 
"
3,4,Clyde,"Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight.
"
3,4,Pearl,"On your first date, look at the man's shoes. Sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes.  When he takes you out to dinner, try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you. If he only has one credit card, BEWARE.  It means he doesn't spend a lot, and worse yet, it could be a debit card. If he has more than four credit cards, that's a little fishy.  The perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is... two. 
"
3,4,Bebe,"What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?
"
3,4,Pearl,"Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats. 
"
3,4,Cartman,"When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
"
3,4,Kyle,"That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing! 
"
3,4,Fiancée,"Ri-chard!  Ri-chard!  Swing me Richard, swing me higher! Richard, I'm here!  Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes.  But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you.  Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot!  It's all for you!  Aaaaaaa!  Richard!
"
3,4,Clyde,"Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Huh? Uh, what?
"
3,4,Clyde,"Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander 
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I?  Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide. 
"
3,4,Clyde,"What's that?
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago.
"
3,4,Clyde,"What? She die or something?
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"What? Hey! Go on!  You're screwing around in here! 
"
3,4,Clyde,"Oh boy! Here we go!
"
3,4,Wendy,"What's happening?
"
3,4,Kyle,"Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
"
3,4,Wendy,"Oh cool!
"
3,4,Stan,"Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
"
3,4,Cartman,"You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
"
3,4,Kyle,"No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 
"
3,4,Stan,"Well?
"
3,4,Cartman,"Come on!
"
3,4,Wendy,"Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!
"
3,4,Craig,"What do we do?
"
3,4,Stan,"Huh?
"
3,4,Cartman,"What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
"
3,4,Tweek,"How?
"
3,4,Kyle,"How??
"
3,4,Craig,"I've never been in a fight before.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Me neither.
"
3,4,Crowd,"Awwww.
"
3,4,Stan,"Aw, dude, come on!!
"
3,4,Cartman,"You just hit each other, smack each other around. 
"
3,4,Kyle,"Not like that!
"
3,4,Tweek,"Like what, then?
"
3,4,Stan,"All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.
"
3,4,Crowd,"Awww. 
"
3,4,Clyde,"All that build-up for nothing.
"
3,4,Wendy,"Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!
"
3,4,Stan,"All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
"
3,4,Cartman,"I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
"
3,4,Stan,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!
"
3,4,Stan,"Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Fine! 
"
3,4,Kyle,"Fine!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Fine, that's fine!
"
3,4,Jimbo,"Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Rrrrh!
"
3,4,Jimbo,"You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
"
3,4,Ned,"Mmrr I can still kick ass.
"
3,4,Jimbo,"Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Hwaaah! 
"
3,4,Jimbo,"Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing. 
"
3,4,Tweek,"Uugh!
"
3,4,Ned,"Mmm whatcha got, bee-ahtch? 
"
3,4,Jimbo,"Keep your guard up, Tweek! 
"
3,4,Tweek,"Ow!
"
3,4,Stan,"Damn it!
"
3,4,Kyle,"Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
"
3,4,Jimbo,"All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here. 
"
3,4,Ned,"Gmmmmm, whatcha got, bee-ahtch?
"
3,4,Jimbo,"Punch him in the balls, Tweek!! 
"
3,4,Ned,"AAAAaaaarrgh.
"
3,4,Jimbo,"Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down! 
"
3,4,Ned,"Ow.
"
3,4,Jimbo,"Good! Now kick his balls!  There, see? You've got him coughing up blood.
"
3,4,"Stan, Kyle","Hooray!
"
3,4,Tweek,"Rrrr!
"
3,4,Jimbo,"Now THAT'S BOXING!
"
3,4,Master,"Your friend hasa brought you to learn the ancient art ofa sumo. You must learna discipline anda respect.  In sumo, your body must be rike a stone, and your mind rike a meatroaf.
"
3,4,Craig,"Meatloaf?
"
3,4,Master,"The object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. Is opponent ready?
"
3,4,Cartman,"I'm ready!  Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. 
"
3,4,Master,"Let us begin.  Ready? And, th-ree.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Respect my authoritah! 
"
3,4,Master,"Body rike a stone! Mind rike a meatroaf!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Dude. Come on, now. Come on.
"
3,4,Craig,"Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!
"
3,4,Master,"Fight back! Resist the ass!
"
3,4,Craig,"How can I resist an ass so great?
"
3,4,Master,"It is only an ass. You must overcome the ass with your mind.
"
3,4,Craig,"This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master. 
"
3,4,Cartman,"I win!
"
3,4,Master,"There is indeed great power in your ass, Eric. Perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Hey, maybe. 
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"No. No. Make it stop.
"
3,4,Fiancée,"Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever.  But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you.  Don't worry, Richard. I'm a pilot!  Watch me, Richard!  Richard!
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Baaaaa!  I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye!  Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?! 
"
3,4,Pearl,"Okay, that was very good, class. Now let's try this one together.  Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?
"
3,4,Class,"Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?
"
3,4,Pearl,"All right, now let's try this one together.  Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....
"
3,4,Class,"Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....
"
3,4,Pearl,"Good. Bebe, why don't you try this one.  I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
"
3,4,Bebe,"I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
"
3,4,Pearl,"Outstanding! Now, Kenny, how about you try?  I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)
"
3,4,Pearl,"O-kay. Kenny, could I talk to you over here real quick?
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Sure you can.) 
"
3,4,Pearl,"Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Why?)
"
3,4,Pearl,"Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(You don't?)
"
3,4,Pearl,"No. I think you should consider transferring to shop class.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Shop class?)  (No, I won't!)
"
3,4,Pearl,"Now, now. Very few students are severely injured in a shop class.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(I don't wanna take shop class!) 
"
3,4,Bebe,"Come on! It's time for the fight!
"
3,4,Wendy,"Yeah! 
"
3,4,Pearl,"Fight? Oh no no, girls! Haven't I taught you anything?
"
3,4,Stan,"Okay, the time has finally come. 
"
3,4,Clyde,"Programs, get your programs here. Programs.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Hrrr.
"
3,4,Kyle,"This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Rrrr, mean, rrrr.
"
3,4,Cartman,"The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
"
3,4,Craig,"Okay.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
"
3,4,Craig,"Okay, okay!
"
3,4,Tweek,"Rrrr!  Hr. 
"
3,4,Stan,"You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
"
3,4,Craig,"Respect my authority.
"
3,4,"Stan, Kyle","Come on, Tweek!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Come on, Craig!
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Good-bye, cruel world.  Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell! 
"
3,4,Stan,"Ye-hah!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! 
"
3,4,Kyle,"Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Come on, Craig!
"
3,4,Stan,"Come on, Tweek! You got him!
"
3,4,Kyle,"Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
"
3,4,Tweek,"What?
"
3,4,Kyle,"Craig just called you a boner!
"
3,4,Tweek,"Rrrr! 
"
3,4,Kyle,"We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
"
3,4,Stan,"Yeah.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Hi, Mr. Adler.)
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"What? Who are you?  ""Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class."" Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there.  Hrh.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Huh? 
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"What the-? 
"
3,4,Stan,"Here they are.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Hey! What's going on?
"
3,4,Stan,"Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. 
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Well, why the hell don't you stop them?
"
3,4,Cartman,"'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Don't screw aROUND!
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Hey!)  (Hey!)
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Stop screwin' aROUND!!
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Hey, God damn it!)
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!! 
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Ugh!)
"
3,4,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
3,4,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Well, don't just stand there, call an ambulance!  You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class?
"
3,4,Kenny,"(I understand, dude.)
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"What? What's that, son?
"
3,4,Fiancée,"Richard.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"AAaaagh!  No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you. 
"
3,4,Fiancée,"Richard, you have to move on. I want you to be happy.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.
"
3,4,Fiancée,"Then say it now, Richard.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Good-bye?
"
3,4,Fiancée,"There. Now do you feel better?
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"No.
"
3,4,Fiancée,"Of course you don't. Saying good-bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"You... you're right. You're right. 
"
3,4,Woman,"Richard, this is Grandma.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Gram'ma? Hi, Gram!
"
3,4,Gram'ma,"You never said good-bye to me either. 
"
3,4,Man,"Hey, Richard. Remember me?
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Uncle Corey! Wow, you're all alive again!
"
3,4,Uncle Corey,"No! We're dead! 
"
3,4,Fiancée,"I love you, Richard. See you soon.
"
3,4,Mr. Adler,"Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive.  Thank you, baby. Thank you.
"
3,4,Stan,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
3,4,Stan,"Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.
"
3,4,Nurse,"Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up. 
"
3,4,Stan,"Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?
"
3,4,Tweek,"Rrr!
"
3,4,Craig,"Ugh.
"
3,4,Stan,"Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
"
3,4,Cartman,"Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Boy, do we ever.
"
3,4,Stan,"So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. 
"
3,4,"Tweek, Craig","What?!
"
3,4,Stan,"Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.
"
3,4,Craig,"What was on the news?
"
3,4,Cartman,"Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig.
"
3,4,Craig,"Huh?
"
3,4,Kyle,"Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
"
3,4,Tweek,"Uuh! You son of a bitch! 
"
3,4,Craig,"I'm gonna kick your ass!
"
3,4,Stan,"Come on, Tweek! You got him!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!
"
3,5,Cartman,"You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, ""I Hate You Guys"":
I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny.
I hate him the most.
Okay now, let's try one all together:
I hate you guys. Come on, you guys know the words.
Specially Kenny.
"
3,5,Kyle,"This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 
"
3,5,Stan,"Where are you going?
"
3,5,Cartman,"I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
"
3,5,Kyle,"Just go behind a tree.
"
3,5,Cartman,"I have to go number two.
"
3,5,Stan,"So? You can poo in the wilderness.
"
3,5,Cartman,"No way, dude! What would I wipe with?
"
3,5,Kyle,"Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Well what do I sit on?
"
3,5,Kyle,"You just squat, stupid! 
"
3,5,Stan,"Not here! Go further away!
"
3,5,Cartman,"God, I'm glad you guys know all these ""pooping outside"" rules!  Urgh. Come on, now.
"
3,5,Kyle,"Watch out for ground eels! 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Stop, you guys! I can't think!
"
3,5,Kyle,"What do you have to think about?
"
3,5,Cartman,"I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream...  Oh, that did it.
"
3,5,Stan,"Sick, dude!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Poopin' outside,
Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves?
"
3,5,Kenny,"(Here you go.)  (No way!) 
"
3,5,Cartman,"What the?
"
3,5,Creature,"Oohma poota!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!
"
3,5,Stan,"We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!
"
3,5,Cartman,"You guys, get over here!
"
3,5,Kyle,"No way, dude!
"
3,5,Cartman,"I'm serious now!  Look. Over by those bushes.
"
3,5,Kyle,"What?
"
3,5,Creature,"Meesa scared!
"
3,5,Stan,"I see it!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Come on! Let's kill it! 
"
3,5,Kyle,"Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!
"
3,5,Announcer,"Look at this sword. Only on House Shopping Network. It has a dragon on the blade.  It's got a dragon painted right on the blade! You should buy the samurai sw-
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?!  I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!
"
3,5,Ned,"Shut... up... Jimbo.
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out.
"
3,5,Stan,"I saw it this way!
"
3,5,Kyle,"Over here!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Come on, you guys!
"
3,5,Jimbo,"What the hell's goin' on?!
"
3,5,Stan,"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on!  Where did it go?
"
3,5,Kyle,"It just ran by here a second ago. 
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap!  Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready. 
"
3,5,Creature,"Ooba jaaga!
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
"
3,5,Creature,"Meesa gonna die? Wooo-wowoop!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.
"
3,5,Kyle,"It's stupid.
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Well, let's kill it.
"
3,5,Cartman,"No! No. Don't.
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Huh?
"
3,5,Cartman,"I like it.
"
3,5,Kyle,"You don't like anything, Cartman! 
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it.
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight. 
"
3,5,Sheila,"Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie. 
"
3,5,Fed,"Mayor, we're from the Department of Interior.
"
3,5,Mayor,"Ooh, yes. How are you?
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Fine, just fine.
"
3,5,DOI 2,"Fine, just fine.
"
3,5,DOI 3,"Fine.
"
3,5,Mayor,"Right over here. 
"
3,5,DOI 2,"My God, McClanahan, do you believe it? 
"
3,5,Creature,"Meesa needa Jakov.  Dwooooooo!
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Mm-it's amazing.
"
3,5,Mayor,"What?
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Mayor, this is a jakovasaur. A live one has never been seen.
"
3,5,Mayor,"Oh, neato.
"
3,5,DOI 2,"Incredible.  We know of this creature only from remains frozen in snow.
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Do you realize what this means? We could use its DNA and have a chance of bringing the entire jakovasaur species back from extinction.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Wow! Cool!
"
3,5,Ned,"Is... there... re... ward... money? 
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!
"
3,5,DOI 2,"This one jakovasaur can mother an entire population of the animals.
"
3,5,Woman,"Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope.
"
3,5,Woman 2,"Hope.
"
3,5,Man,"Yes, Hope.
"
3,5,Stan,"I think his name is Junjun.
"
3,5,Mayor,"Hope. Why, that's a perfectly beautiful name!
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Now we must find a safe place for it.
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"I'll keep it at my house.
"
3,5,Mayor,"No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!
"
3,5,Junjun,"Uuh?!
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"What?! How dare you say that?!
"
3,5,Mayor,"Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut.
"
3,5,Rancher,"Oh, I got a barn it can stay in. It ain't much, but it's heated.
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Well, that sounds fine, just fine.
"
3,5,DOI 3,"Fine, just fine.
"
3,5,DOI 2,"Fine.
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon?  Oh, whatever!
"
3,5,Announcer,"It's got a dragon painted on the blade. This is the Sumatomi sword-
"
3,5,Cartman,"Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??
"
3,5,Liane,"I'll think about it, hon.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Sweet.  Mom, somebody's at the door.
"
3,5,Liane,"Mommy's busy, boopie-kins.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Should I get it?
"
3,5,Liane,"Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Okay.
"
3,5,Liane,"Hmmm. 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold your horses! God!  Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!
"
3,5,Liane,"That's nice, muffin.
"
3,5,Jakovasaur,"Please help me. Whoa-oh-oh-oh.  Please help me find Junjun. She has been gone since last night, and I'm worried sick.
"
3,5,Cartman,"You mean the other jakovasaur?
"
3,5,Jakovasaur,"What means a jakovasaur?
"
3,5,Cartman,"You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
"
3,5,Jakovasaur,"Oh. Cool beans.
"
3,5,Cartman,"But the other jakovasaur talked different.
"
3,5,Jakovasaur,"That's 'cause Junjun's a girl. Girls talk different.
"
3,5,Cartman,"I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
"
3,5,Jakovasaur,"Please take me to Junjun. We're the last of our kind. There are only two of us left.
"
3,5,Cartman,"He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. 
"
3,5,Kyle,"Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
"
3,5,Cartman,"Will you stop with the whole ""mom smoking crack"" thing?! It's a old joke!
"
3,5,Jakovasaur,"Eric, do you have any more cookies? 
"
3,5,Stan,"Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?
"
3,5,Cartman,"No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. 
"
3,5,Stan,"Wow!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Huhello, guys. I love new friends. 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?
"
3,5,Stan,"No, he's annoying.
"
3,5,Kyle,"What are we supposed to do with him?
"
3,5,Cartman,"We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
"
3,5,Stan,"Why don't we just tell our parents?
"
3,5,Cartman,"No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
"
3,5,Stan,"Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Junjun!
"
3,5,Stan,"Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Oh, Junjun, I'm so glad you're okay! 
"
3,5,Kyle,"Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!
"
3,5,Jakov,"I am whispering!  Yyeow!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov.
"
3,5,Jakov,"I am?
"
3,5,Stan,"Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?
"
3,5,Jakov,"Oh, I don't know. This place is kinda nicer than Stark's Pond. 
"
3,5,Junjun,"Aw, we's in big doodoo now.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Uh oh.
"
3,5,Operator,"Hello, and welcome to Voice Box Express, your #1 source for voice boxes. I'm Amanda. How may I help you?
"
3,5,Ned,"Yes... Hello..., um..., I... lost... my... voice... box...
"
3,5,Amanda,"Excuse me?
"
3,5,Ned,"I... lost... my... voice... box...
"
3,5,Amanda,"Excuse me?
"
3,5,Ned,"I... lost... my... voice... box... 
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box!  You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go.  Well, try it out!
"
3,5,Ned,"Mmm. Aw, Jimbo, I can't thank you enough for the new voice box. Gmmm, now, what in the devil is this thing?
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake.
"
3,5,Ned,"Mmm-aw, what a bloody pickle this is! Did you keep the receipt, then?
"
3,5,Man,"You guys come quick! I've only just heard!
"
3,5,Jimbo,"What? What is it?
"
3,5,Man,"They've found another one! They've found another jakovasaur! 
"
3,5,Ned,"Gmmm, blimey.
"
3,5,Mayor,"Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Thank you, Mayor.  The noble jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction. And now, you, as a community, have a chance to bring them back.
"
3,5,Cartman,"""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor...""
"
3,5,Kyle,"What are you doing, fatass?!
"
3,5,Cartman,"I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor...""
"
3,5,DOI 1,"...Hope and Jakov are the last of their kind. But with the help of the Mayor, we have implemented a plan to help them breed. We will give them a home and a fighting chance at survival.
"
3,5,Man,"Yea for us!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Thank you!
"
3,5,Mayor,"And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction.
"
3,5,Man 2,"Well, that's about it. Let's go.
"
3,5,Man 3,"Yeah. 
"
3,5,Cartman,"You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me...  Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Wow!! It's so pretty!
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Well, Jakov, we hope this new home ""inspires"" you and Hope to uh, hm, you know... 
"
3,5,Jakov,"What?
"
3,5,DOI 2,"Well, we'd love to see more jakovasaurs, so, maybe you two should uuh...
"
3,5,Jakov,"What?
"
3,5,DOI 3,"Get to some business. 
"
3,5,Jakov,"What??
"
3,5,Kyle,"They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Ooohh.
"
3,5,Mayor,"We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Well, all right, then. 
"
3,5,Junjun,"Meesa just don't wanna!
"
3,5,Jakov,"I don't know what to do!
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Jakov, to have sex, all you need to do is, well, you know, put your...  Hmmm.  I guess we don't know exactly how jakovasaurs mate.
"
3,5,DOI 2,"There is... another option.
"
3,5,Mephesto,"I've managed to artificially inseminate Hope with your semen.
"
3,5,Jakov,"I have seamen? Where's their boat?  Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr! 
"
3,5,Mephesto,"Yes, yes, that's... very funny, Jakov.  I... will need to examine Hope once more to see if the process worked. 
"
3,5,Junjun,"Oh-wwoooooop! Oh-wwoooooop!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr!
"
3,5,Stan,"God-damn!
"
3,5,Kyle,"Shut up!!
"
3,5,Mephesto,"Yes! Yes, I think it worked!  You are going to be parents!
"
3,5,DOI 3,"Yeah!
"
3,5,DOI 2,"We did it!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Now I can be like all the other guys in South Park!
"
3,5,Stan,"Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?
"
3,5,Commentator,"...and Bubby Brister is having a great first quarter! Let's see what trickery he uses here. Here's the snap, and he's down-
"
3,5,Jakov,"Thanks for inviting me to watch the game, guys!
"
3,5,Randy,"No problem, Jakov.
"
3,5,Commentator,"To the 40-yard line!
"
3,5,Men,"Yea!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Go Niners! Ni-ners!
"
3,5,Gerald,"We're rooting for the Broncos here, Jakov!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Oooops!
"
3,5,Commentator,"...to Terrell Davis! He's at the 50, the 40, the 30,... 
"
3,5,Jakov,"You guys know what?  This one time, I was watching this rabbit, a brown rabbit-
"
3,5,Commentator,"He breaks another tackle, and the ball is loose!
"
3,5,Jakov,"You guys know what... happened? It touched Junjun right in front of me.
"
3,5,Randy,"Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?
"
3,5,Jakov,"Sure. You got money?
"
3,5,Gerald,"Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Cool beans.  Oopsie. I'll be right back. 
"
3,5,Mr. Mackey,"Jakovasaurs kinda piss me off, mkay.
"
3,5,The others,"Yup.
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Amazing! The gestation period was only four days.
"
3,5,DOI 2,"At that rate, we could repopulate the jakovasaurs in just a few years.
"
3,5,Junjun,"Doe-wooop!
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Don't worry, Hope. Everything's gonna be fine, just fine.
"
3,5,DOI 3,"Just fine.
"
3,5,DOI 2,"Fine.
"
3,5,Kyle,"Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
"
3,5,Cartman,"If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct.
"
3,5,Kyle,"Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!
"
3,5,DOI 2,"Here we go.
"
3,5,Junjun,"Doe-woooop!
"
3,5,Sheila,"Behold, the miracle of childbirth!
"
3,5,Junjun,"Dowoop! 
"
3,5,Kyle,"Gross! 
"
3,5,Junjun,"Dowoop! 
"
3,5,All,"Hooray!
"
3,5,DOI 3,"This is the first step in bringing the species back from the brink of extinction! 
"
3,5,Junjun,"Dowoooop! Dowoop!
"
3,5,DOI 2,"Looks like there might be a second one.
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Wow! That would be a great start for them. 
"
3,5,All,"Hooray! 
"
3,5,Mayor,"She's a cannon! 
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Well. Ap-parently, they breed in litters.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Aren't they cute, you guys?
"
3,5,Stan,"Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
"
3,5,Junjun,"Huh-owhoa-o-woop! 
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Huh?!  Whoa-o-whoa!
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class. 
"
3,5,Stan,"Dude, it's crowded in here.
"
3,5,Jakovasaur Boy,"I like school!
"
3,5,Jakovasaur Girl,"Bo-woop!
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history.  Now, does anyone know why Chubby Checker left the Beatles in 1972?  Yes?
"
3,5,Jakovasaur Boy,"I don't know.
"
3,5,Jakovasaur Girl,"Bo-woop!
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?
"
3,5,Jakovasaur Kid 1,"I can't.
"
3,5,Jakovasaur Kid 2,"Me neither.
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!
"
3,5,Jakovasaur Kid 2,"Oh.
"
3,5,Jakovasaur Kid 3,"O-wowo-oop! O-woo-oop!
"
3,5,Jakovasaur Kid 4,"Ooo! Fight! Fight! 
"
3,5,Jakovasaur Kid 5,"School, school! I like school! 
"
3,5,Jakovasaurs,"School, school! I like school! 
School, school! I like school!
"
3,5,Kyle,"Dude, this sucks ass!
"
3,5,Cartman,"I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool. 
"
3,5,Mr. Hat,"This is insane, Mr. Garrison. 
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"It sure is, Mr. Hat. 
"
3,5,Mayor,"Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out!
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my classroom. I can't teach our kids anything!
"
3,5,All,"Yeah!
"
3,5,Chef,"And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up!
"
3,5,All,"Yeah!
"
3,5,Man,"Totally!
"
3,5,Trashman,"And they're creating more trash than we can handle, too!
"
3,5,Man,"Totally!
"
3,5,All,"Yeah!
"
3,5,Man,"Listen to her!
"
3,5,Man 2,"And what about little Laura, the Williams' kid? If she doesn't get that heart-valve operation, she could die.  Yeah! Yeah, that's right!
"
3,5,Mayor,"All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave.
"
3,5,Jimbo,"We just encourage them to find someplace better.
"
3,5,Mayor,"But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?
"
3,5,Jakov,"Memphis?
"
3,5,Mayor,"Yes, Memphis.  You jakovasaurs would love it there.
"
3,5,Jakov,"I don't know. I like South Park a lot. What do you think, honey?
"
3,5,Junjun,"G'ooh-woo-ooop!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Yeah.
"
3,5,Mayor,"But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right? 
"
3,5,Jakov,"Okay, we'll move to Memphis!
"
3,5,Some men,"Yea!
"
3,5,Others,"Hooray! 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Hey, Jakov, how's it going?
"
3,5,Jakov,"Great, Eric! We're moving.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Moving?
"
3,5,Jakov,"Me, Jun and the family are heading to the Promised Land of Memphis.
"
3,5,Cartman,"You... can't leave. You're my friend.
"
3,5,Liane,"Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best.
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Jakov, please don't go.  You make everything in South Park fun.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you.
"
3,5,Jakov,"It would?
"
3,5,Cartman,"Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?
"
3,5,Jakov,"O-kay. I like South Park best of all. We're staying!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Hoo-ray! Jakov is staying, you guys! 
"
3,5,Mayor,"Now what do we do?
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Don't worry, We've come up with a plan.
"
3,5,Mayor,"You have?
"
3,5,DOI 1,"Yes. We're leaving.
"
3,5,All,"What??
"
3,5,DOI 1,"We're getting the hell out of here and away from those God-damned things.
"
3,5,Mayor,"You can't leave.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Yes. Who would take care of them?
"
3,5,DOI 2,"Little boy, we're making you an honorary Department of Interior person.  So now, you are officially in charge of South Park's fish and wildlife. You have authority over all of them.
"
3,5,Cartman,"I have authoriteh?
"
3,5,DOI 2,"That's right. And people must respect it.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Well, that should be fine, just fine. 
"
3,5,DOI 2,"Fine, just fine.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Fine.
"
3,5,Stan,"Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!
"
3,5,DOI 2,"Bye-bye, now. 
"
3,5,Announcer,"And now back to... Jakovasaurs! on Comedy Central. 
"
3,5,Jakov,"Hi, honey! I'm home!  Wooooo!  Boy, it was rough at work today. I've never seen so much coffee.
"
3,5,Junjun,"Booo-wooop?
"
3,5,Jakov,"No, in the boss's lap. 
"
3,5,Boy,"Hello, dad.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Hello, son. How was your day?
"
3,5,Boy,"Oh, not so good. Something really strange happened.
"
3,5,Jakov,"What? You mean MTV played a video that wasn't Will Smith? 
"
3,5,Boy,"Noho, dad. A man in a blue suit and a bag came to the door. He just left this li'l piece of paper with a stamp on it. 
"
3,5,Jakov,"That's called a mailman. He takes care of mail.
"
3,5,Boy,"Oh! He took care of mom, too. 
"
3,5,Jakov,"You're a nut! Let me see that letter.  It's from a game show. The Mayor has invited me to compete. 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Hi, Jakov.  What the hell is that?  Who's laughing?
"
3,5,Jakov,"Eric! The Mayor has invited us to compete on a game show in South Park! Big prizes, an all-expense paid vacation-
"
3,5,Cartman,"Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready. 
"
3,5,Jakov,"Woo, woo! 
"
3,5,Mayor,"Come onn, come on!  Hello!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Mayor? This is Jakov. I'm the tall fellow down the block from-
"
3,5,Mayor,"Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Sure! If a free trip is involved, can my whole family go?
"
3,5,Mayor,"Of course! That's the point! Just be ready this afternoon at the public access building, and good luck! Hope you win!! 
"
3,5,Jakov,"Cool beans!! 
"
3,5,Mayor,"We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some normalcy back to this town! Ready?
"
3,5,All,"Break!
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express.
"
3,5,Ned,"Oh... boy..., oh... boy.
"
3,5,Mayor,"Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose!
"
3,5,Barbrady,"Right.
"
3,5,Mayor,"Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs!  Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France!  And, all one of you lucky constetants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players?
"
3,5,Barbrady,"Ready.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Ready.
"
3,5,Mayor,"Okay. Hands on your buzzers.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Forty-seven! 
"
3,5,Mayor,"You have to wait until I ask the question first.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Sor-ry!
"
3,5,Mayor,"That's okay. Hands on buzzers.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Turkey sandwich!
"
3,5,Barbrady,"Damn, he's quick!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Oh. Sor-ry! 
"
3,5,Barbrady,"No, I'm sorry. 
"
3,5,Jakov,"No, it's my fault. I'm sorry.
"
3,5,Barbrady,"No, it's all me. Uh, my bad.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Sorry.
"
3,5,Barbrady,"Sorry. 
"
3,5,Mayor,"Will somebody please unplug the God-damned buzzers?! 
"
3,5,Stagehand,"Got it!
"
3,5,Mayor,"Now, can we get on with this? First question: What color is blue? 
"
3,5,Barbrady,"Blue? 
"
3,5,Mayor,"What?
"
3,5,Barbrady,"Uh. Blue is blue?
"
3,5,Jakov,"Awww, did I lose?
"
3,5,Mayor,"What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on.  You're supposed to lose, you idiot!
"
3,5,Barbrady,"Where am I?
"
3,5,Mayor,"Just don't answer any more questions, got it?
"
3,5,Barbrady,"Okie-dokie.
"
3,5,Mayor,"Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!
"
3,5,Cartman,"What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.
"
3,5,Stan,"Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.
"
3,5,Kyle,"We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.
"
3,5,Kyle,"There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
"
3,5,Cartman,"That's Kenny with branches on his head.  Why did you bring me all the out here, you guys?
"
3,5,Stan,"Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! 
"
3,5,Kyle,"Cartman! Wait!
"
3,5,Kenny,"(Hey you guys, wait up for me!)  (Waaah!) 
"
3,5,Mayor,"What's two plus two, Jakov?
"
3,5,Jakov,"I don't know!
"
3,5,Barbrady,"Four? 
"
3,5,Mayor,"Jakov, what is your name? 
"
3,5,Barbrady,"Jakov 
"
3,5,Mayor,"Oh, screw it. Jakov wins! 
"
3,5,Jakov,"I do? 
"
3,5,Mayor,"You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Hooray!
"
3,5,Mayor,"All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport!  Let's go, people! There's no time to lose! 
"
3,5,Jakov,"But what about our clothes? Shouldn't we pack first?
"
3,5,Randy,"Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov.
"
3,5,Jakov,"Oh yeah. Well, good-bye everybody! We'll send stuff from France!
"
3,5,Crowd,"Good-bye!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Werrr. 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Jakov!
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Close the door! 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Open this door!
"
3,5,Liane,"Eric, this is for the best.
"
3,5,Cartman,"I am Department of Interior guy, and I have authoritah!  No! Jakov, don't go!
"
3,5,Jakov,"Hi, Eric! Okay, bye, then! 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Come... back. 
"
3,5,Liane,"Eric, it's important for you to understand-.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Don't, mother! Just, don't.
"
3,5,Mayor,"I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution.
"
3,5,Jimbo,"The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.
"
3,5,Ned,"We can't go around saving every form of life, any more than we can kill them all. We have to let nature run its course. 
"
3,5,Jimbo,"Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks!
"
3,5,Ned,"I know. I'm still trying to find my old one.
"
3,5,Mayor,"Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!
"
3,5,Crowd,"Hooray!
"
3,5,Cartman,"No. That's okay. I'll see you guys. 
"
3,5,Kyle,"Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
"
3,5,Stan,"Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
"
3,5,Waiter,"Bonjour.
"
3,5,Woman,"Bonjour.
"
3,5,Waiter,"Café?
"
3,5,Woman,"Oui. 
"
3,5,Jakov,"Come on, kids! Let's go find some pyramids!  Woops! Aaaah! 
"
3,5,Man,"C'est drôle et amusant (That was SO FUNNY!!) 
"
3,5,Accordionist,"(I love its antics!!!)
"
3,5,Blonde,"Il est si comme Jerry Lewis!!! (He's just like Jerry Lewis!!!) 
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school.
"
3,6,Kyle,"About what?
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means?  Yes, Eric?
"
3,6,Cartman,"When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Petey, the Sexual Harassment Panda. 
"
3,6,Petey,"Who lives in the east 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
Who explains sexual harassment to you and me?
Sexual Harassment Panda
""Don't say that! Don't touch there!
Don't be nasty!"" says the silly bear
He's come to tell you what's right and wrong
Sexual Harassment Panda
Hi, boys and girls. 
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Say ""hi"" to Sexual Harassment Panda!
"
3,6,Class,"Hi, Sexual Harassment Panda.
"
3,6,Clyde,"Hababah...
"
3,6,Petey,"Did you know that when one little panda pulls on another little panda's underwear, that's sexual harassment? That makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. 
"
3,6,Kyle,"This is freaking me out, dude.
"
3,6,Petey,"And when one little panda puts his furry little willy in another panda's ear, that makes me a very sad panda.  Now, I'm going to pass out these booklets, and we're going to go through each and every sexual harassment law.
"
3,6,Class,"Awgh..!
"
3,6,Petey,"""...Article 36, Section 19: One panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance. If said panda does make...""
"
3,6,Stan,"Ohh, dude, get me out of here!
"
3,6,Cartman,"I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.
"
3,6,Stan,"You would think that, you little ass-sucker.
"
3,6,Cartman,"What did you call me?
"
3,6,Stan,"An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
"
3,6,Cartman,"That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!
"
3,6,Petey,"Uh-oh.
"
3,6,Stan,"What?
"
3,6,Cartman,"You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.
"
3,6,Petey,"That's right, he can.
"
3,6,Stan,"No you can't, you little ass-sucker!
"
3,6,Cartman,"Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!
"
3,6,Petey,"""The first party of the first panda may sue the second-party panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda.""
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman?
"
3,6,Cartman,"Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Dude! He got a lawyer?
"
3,6,Gerald,"Sorry I'm late.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Dad?!
"
3,6,Gerald,"Oh! Hi, Kyle. 
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Th... That is correct, my honor.
"
3,6,Stan,"Hoh, whatever! 
"
3,6,Cartman,"He talked about having oral sex with my ass.
"
3,6,Stan,"I called you an ass-sucker!
"
3,6,Cartman,"Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset.  I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. 
"
3,6,Stan,"What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!
"
3,6,Gerald,"As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue.
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say?
"
3,6,Stan,"Wwhat do you mean?
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"I need to hear your defense.
"
3,6,Stan,"Uh... I'm eight?
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty.
"
3,6,Stan,"Huh?
"
3,6,Gerald,"All right, we did it!
"
3,6,Cartman,"Hooray!
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"Since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately.
"
3,6,Stan,"I have to give him half my stuff?
"
3,6,Cartman,"Sweet..!
"
3,6,Cartman,"Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game , and that Power Jim doll.  And, let's see...  Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?
"
3,6,Stan,"Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Oh, well, I'll just take that, then.  And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?
"
3,6,Stan,"Uh, no! I hate that toy!
"
3,6,Cartman,"Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! 
"
3,6,Stan,"Damnit!
"
3,6,Collector,"Here you go. As your legal fee you can choose between the green choo-choo or the squishy football.
"
3,6,Gerald,"Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...
"
3,6,Cartman,"Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
"
3,6,Gerald,"Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next.
"
3,6,Cartman,"What? But uh, why should I sue the school?
"
3,6,Gerald,"Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Interesting.  Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that. 
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom?
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"No, I had no freakin' idea!
"
3,6,Gerald,"Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment!
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat.
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"I'm sorry, toots.
"
3,6,Gerald,"Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Yes.
"
3,6,Gerald,"And you did nothing.
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Well, he is a little ass-sucker. 
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court!
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, baby, I'm sorry.
"
3,6,Gerald,"Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?
"
3,6,Principal Victoria,"Well, not any more than any other student.
"
3,6,Gerald,"Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
"
3,6,Principal Victoria,"I don't know!
"
3,6,Gerald,"You don't know?! You're the principal!
"
3,6,Principal Victoria,"I can't be around every second!
"
3,6,Gerald,"So it DOES go on!!!
"
3,6,Principal Victoria,"All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!!  OH GOD!!!
"
3,6,Gerald,"Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?
"
3,6,Principal Victoria,"I believe so, yes. 
"
3,6,Man,"That's sexual harassment.
"
3,6,Gerald,"Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda.
"
3,6,Petey,"Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
"
3,6,Gerald,"Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?
"
3,6,Petey,"Well, when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex, that is sexual harassment.
"
3,6,Gerald,"And who's to blame?
"
3,6,Petey,"I'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible.
"
3,6,Gerald,"There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!
"
3,6,Petey,"Panda.
"
3,6,Gerald,"Pan-Panda's mouth.
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"After careful review, it is the judgment of this court that South Park Elementary pays Eric Theodore Cartman $1.3 million in damages.
"
3,6,Gerald,"All right! We did it, Eric!
"
3,6,Cartman,"It's time to celebrate, yeahIt's time to celebrate, yeah
"
3,6,Gerald,"That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?
"
3,6,Kyle,"It's... big.
"
3,6,Gerald,"Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
"
3,6,Gerald,"Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.
"
3,6,Kyle,"And you don't see a problem with that?
"
3,6,Gerald,"No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
"
3,6,Kyle,"You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
"
3,6,Gerald,"Sort of, yeah.
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions?  Yes, Stan?
"
3,6,Stan,"Where's our desks?
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits.
"
3,6,Stan,"You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?
"
3,6,Cartman,"All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!
"
3,6,Clyde,"Wow! I wanna sue somebody! 
"
3,6,Bebe,"Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer.
"
3,6,Class,"Yeah!
"
3,6,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun. 
"
3,6,Class,"AAGGGHHH!!
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, ""The ball is red..."" 
"
3,6,Class,"AAGGGGHHH!!
"
3,6,Gerald,"Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you  close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!
"
3,6,Bebe,"After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad! 
"
3,6,Clyde,"Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls! 
"
3,6,Gerald,"So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me! 
"
3,6,Singers,"Kids picking on you? Well, don't be sad
Just sue their asses with Kyle's dad
"
3,6,Chairman,"All right, what other cuts do we have to make to the school budget?
"
3,6,Woman,"Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools.
"
3,6,Chairman,"Oh, right. We certainly can't afford him anymore.
"
3,6,Woman,"I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously.
"
3,6,Petey,"Hello, sexual harassment cubs.
Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
"
3,6,Mr. Evans,"Uh uh, have a seat, Mr. Morris.
"
3,6,Petey,"Who?
"
3,6,Mr. Evans,"Uh... S-Sexual Harassment Panda.
"
3,6,Petey,"Oh, all right. 
"
3,6,Mr. Evans,"Uh—M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a ""panda"" isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children. 
"
3,6,Woman,"You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment.  At all.
"
3,6,Mr. Evans,"...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go.
"
3,6,Petey,"I'm a sa-a-a-a-ad panda.
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"Eric Cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed Pip Philip at school.
"
3,6,Cartman,"No way!
"
3,6,Pip,"I won!
"
3,6,Cartman,"This is ridiculous!
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"You asked Pip to suck your... you know what. You must give Pip half your stuff, and the school must give Pip $1.6 million.
"
3,6,Principal Victoria,"Oh, dear God!
"
3,6,Gerald,"Wow, I'm good!
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"Next!
"
3,6,Craig,"This girl touched my thigh.
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"Half her belongings, school is sued for 2.1 million.
"
3,6,Principal Victoria,"We're ruined!
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"Next!
"
3,6,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, Your Honor, this young man commented on the shape of my ass.
"
3,6,Tweek,"Guh!
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"Half his stuff, 2 million from the school.
"
3,6,Principal Victoria,"Oh..! 
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today.  Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president?
"
3,6,Clyde,"Um...
"
3,6,Gerald,"Don't answer that!
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, Craig, how about you?
"
3,6,Craig,"Um...  Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.
"
3,6,Gerald,"Incriminate.
"
3,6,Craig,"Incriminate.
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, I'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers. It is really disrupting class time!  Uh huh. Ri-oh, uh oh, I see. Oh, okay. Ri-ight.  Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum...
"
3,6,Kevin,"Let's trade sandwiches.
"
3,6,Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
3,6,Boys,"Hey, Chef.
"
3,6,Chef,"How's it going?
"
3,6,Stan,"Bad.
"
3,6,Chef,"Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!
"
3,6,Chef,"Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Oh my God! You guys have to do something!
"
3,6,Stan,"Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?
"
3,6,Chef,"I don't know, children.  Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?
"
3,6,Kyle,"I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.
"
3,6,Chef,"Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Hey, what about that stupid panda?
"
3,6,Stan,"Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!
"
3,6,Chef,"Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Noooo! 
"
3,6,Mr. Evans,"That's thirty-two more lawsuits in the past twenty-four hours.
"
3,6,Woman,"Oh my God!
"
3,6,Mr. Evans,"Looks like we'll have to cut all counseling and nutrition programs.
"
3,6,Woman,"The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.
"
3,6,Mr. Evans,"Holy smokes, you're right!
"
3,6,Stan,"'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.
"
3,6,Mr. Evans,"Ugh!  P-please! Don't sue us.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Huh?
"
3,6,Man,"We'll give you anything you want.
"
3,6,Stan,"We want Sexual Harassment Panda.
"
3,6,Mr. Evans,"Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go.
"
3,6,Cartman,"What?!
"
3,6,Mr. Evans,"D'uh. I mean, he left.
"
3,6,Stan,"Well, where is he?!
"
3,6,Woman,"We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!
"
3,6,Stan,"What the hell is wrong with these people?!
"
3,6,Company rep,"Well. Uh, your credentials are very impressive, and you do seem to have a lot of ambition, uh but I'm afraid there's no room for you at our company at this time.
"
3,6,Petey,"It's because I'm a panda, isn't it?
"
3,6,Company rep,"Well, i-it is because you're a panda. Euh, it's because you're a sexual harassment panda.
"
3,6,Petey,"I can't help what I am.
"
3,6,Company rep,"Now, have you ever heard of a retreat called ""The Island of Misfit Mascots""?
"
3,6,Petey,"Well, yes, but that place is for loser mascots that make no sense.
"
3,6,Company rep,"Well, uh, yes. They may be... just what you're looking for.
"
3,6,Petey,"I don't have to sit here and listen to this! How would you like a big panda punch in your puss?!
"
3,6,Reporter,"As sexual harassment lawsuits increase all over the state, the mother of all trials is set to begin. The sexual harassment case of Everyone vs. Everyone begins tomorrow. No matter what the outcome, the public schools are sure to lose at least a whopping $30 million. Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski, the lawyer from South Park who plans to make quite a commission. Representing the side of Everyone Else is Gerald Broflovski. So whatever the outcome, things look very bright for Kyle's dad. Personally, I think Kyle's dad is just a whore, taking advantage of everyone in town and...  This just in! Newscaster Kevin McCarty is being sued by Kyle's dad for slander. The newscaster has yet to be reached for comment. Wait...
"
3,6,Jukebox,"Some days just seem lonely
Still, there don't seem to be no end in sight...
"
3,6,Barkeep,"Another scotch? 
"
3,6,Jukebox,"So I'll drive this ol' 18-wheeler down the highway...
"
3,6,Standing Patron,"Hey! Panda bear!  We don't take kindly to your types in here.
"
3,6,Barkeep,"Now, calm down, Skeeter. He ain't hurtin' nobody.
"
3,6,Skeeter,"No!  I wanna know som'in' from Mr. Panda Bear here! If you pandas are from mountainous areas of China and Tibet, how come you eat bamboo, which is prone to grow only in drier, more arid regions?! 
"
3,6,Barkeep,"Sk-heeter, I don't want no trouble nu-how.
"
3,6,Petey,"It's okay. I get it. There's no room in the world for pandas. Well, you don't have to worry about me! I'm off to the Island of Misfit Mascots! 
"
3,6,Barkeep,"Damnit, Skeeter! How come every time a panda bear come in here you gotta go flappin' your jaw?
"
3,6,Gerald,"Well? What do you think, Kyle?
"
3,6,Kyle,"Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
"
3,6,Gerald,"Well, this one is bigger!
"
3,6,Kyle,"Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
"
3,6,Gerald,"Kyle, let me explain something to you.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Hoh God, here we go.
"
3,6,Gerald,"You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Isn't that fascism?
"
3,6,Gerald,"No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?
"
3,6,Kyle,"Do you?
"
3,6,Gerald,"Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it.
"
3,6,Stan,"'Scuse me.
"
3,6,Barkeep,"Yeah? What can I do for you?
"
3,6,Stan,"Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
"
3,6,Barkeep,"Big panda bear, big panda bear, hm...
"
3,6,Skeeter,"Hey! Eight-year old! We don't take kindly to your types in here.
"
3,6,Barkeep,"Now, calm down, Skeeter. They ain't hurtin' nobody.
"
3,6,Skeeter,"No!  I wanna know som'in' from Mr. I'm Eight Years Old here! How come you types are always wearin' them funny padded shirts in the winter?!
"
3,6,Stan,"...Coats?
"
3,6,Barkeep,"Now, Skeeter, I don't want no trouble.
"
3,6,Patron with hat,"We don't take kindly to your types around here!
"
3,6,Stan,"Dude, what the hell is going in?!
"
3,6,Cartman,"Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not?
"
3,6,Skeeter,"We don't take kindly to panda bears!
"
3,6,Stan,"Well, we don't take kindly to you!
"
3,6,Patron with hat,"Well, we don't take kindly to folks that don't take kindly around here. 
"
3,6,Barkeep,"Kids, there was a panda bear in here. He said somethin' about the Island of Misfit Mascots.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Where's that?
"
3,6,Barkeep,"If I'm not mistaken, it's over near the Jenkins' place.
"
3,6,Stan,"Come on, we'd better hurry. 
"
3,6,Skeeter,"Whoa! Lookie her!  Hey! Beautiful woman!  We don't take kindly to your types around here!
"
3,6,Barkeep,"Nu-how, Skeeter. She ain't hurtin' nobody.
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"This is Case No. 47g, Everyone vs. Everyone.  Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski.
"
3,6,Gerald,"Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated.
"
3,6,Stan,"""Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune"". This must be the place. 
"
3,6,Worm,"Hello there, boys.
"
3,6,Stan,"Whoa! Who are you?
"
3,6,Worm,"I'm Willy, the ""Don't Stare Directly Into The Sun"" Worm. Now, you boys know not to stare directly into the sun, right?
"
3,6,Boys,"Yes.
"
3,6,Willy,"That can burn your retinas and make you blind. 
"
3,6,Stan,"...Thanks a lot, dude.
"
3,6,Pig,"Oink oink! Be sure to run around with scissors, says Oinky, the ""Run Around With Scissors"" Pig.
"
3,6,Cartman,"I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.
"
3,6,Willy,"That's why he's on the Island Of Misfit Mascots. 
"
3,6,Stan,"Have you seen any panda bears?
"
3,6,Willy,"Hm...
"
3,6,Falcon,"Hey, kids! I'm Jimmy, the ""Don't Hold On To A Large Magnet While Someone Else Uses A Fan Nearby"" Falcon!
"
3,6,Kyle,"What??
"
3,6,Jimmy,"Here, watch. 
"
3,6,Kenny,"(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!)  (Argh--!)
"
3,6,Jimmy,"See?
"
3,6,Stan,"Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
"
3,6,Kyle,"You bastards!  Hey! There he is! 
"
3,6,Petey,"Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
"
3,6,Stan,"Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!
"
3,6,Petey,"Why?
"
3,6,Kyle,"Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
"
3,6,Petey,"Seems all I do now is cause trouble.
"
3,6,Badger,"Hello, kidsh, I'm Happy, the ""Don't Do Stuff That Might Irritate Your Inner Ear"" Badger.  Well, I'll leave now.
"
3,6,Stan,"Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.
"
3,6,Petey,"But, I'm just a panda.
"
3,6,Kyle,"No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 
"
3,6,Willy,"Heeyy, I'm a real worm, pal!!
"
3,6,Kyle,"Okay, sorry, sorry.
"
3,6,Cartman,"You're-you're a worm. That's that's cool, that's cool.
"
3,6,Stan,"Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.
"
3,6,Petey,"What message?
"
3,6,Kyle,"That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
"
3,6,Petey,"...You know? You little cubs might just be right.
"
3,6,Willy,"Yeah!
"
3,6,Petey,"Okay!
"
3,6,Gerald,"Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Wait! 
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, it's Sexual Harassment Panda.
"
3,6,Stan,"No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.
"
3,6,Petey,"Hello, everyone. I'm Petey, the ""Don't Sue People"" Panda.
"
3,6,Jimbo,"""Don't Sue People"" Panda? 
"
3,6,Skeeter,"Hey! We don't take kindly to folks that don't sue people 'round here!
"
3,6,Barkeep,"Nuhow, Skeeter, he ain't hurtin' nobody.
"
3,6,Petey,"Listen to me: when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you.  There's no such thing as free money. When you sue somebody, you take money away from parks and schools and charities, and put it in your own pocket. And that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. 
"
3,6,Bearded man,"I'm a sad panda, too.
"
3,6,Man 1,"I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault! 
"
3,6,Man 2,"Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer!
"
3,6,All,"Yeah!
"
3,6,Gerald,"No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!
"
3,6,Petey,"""Don't Sue People"" Panda.
"
3,6,Gerald,"Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!
"
3,6,Petey/Boys,"Hooray!
"
3,6,Petey,"Pandas love ice cream. 
"
3,6,Judge Julie,"Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out. Case dismissed! 
"
3,6,Skeeter,"Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here!
"
3,6,Barkeep,"God damnit, Skeeter, shut the hell up.
"
3,6,Petey,"Hello, cubs. I'm ""Don't Sue People"" Panda, with an important message for you! Lawsuits damage our society. I know it's tempting to make money, but just remember: that money has to come from somewhere. And usually, it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people. So, until next time, don't let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools. Good-bye now. 
"
3,7,Rumpertumskin,"Heheheheh! Now I will kill the President and Salma Hayek!
"
3,7,Polly,"Oh, save me! Who will save me?
"
3,7,Cartman,"I will! James West, cowboy and rap star!  Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!
"
3,7,Clyde Frog,"If we save her, I am going to take off her pants and play Slip'N'Slide!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Are you okay, Salma Hayek?
"
3,7,Polly,"Yes, but I need to get out of here and eat some tacos and burritos. Me gusta tacos mucho!
"
3,7,Rumpertumskin,"You cannot stop me, James West!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider!  Bang! Bangbang!  Yoyoyo, jiggity jiggy with it! Bang bang bang!  We saved the day! The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch...

3,7,Liane,"Eric.  The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs.
"
3,7,Cartman,"But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West.
"
3,7,Liane,"I have to leave soon, Eric.
"
3,7,Cartman,"But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek.
"
3,7,Liane,"Come down as soon as you're done.

"
3,7,Liane,"Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly.
"
3,7,Shelly,"Okay.
"
3,7,Liane,"All those other babysitters won't come back.
"
3,7,Shelly,"I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time.
"
3,7,Liane,"Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears.
"
3,7,Shelly,"Bears?
"
3,7,Liane,"Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.
"
3,7,Kitty,"Meowrowr!
"
3,7,Cartman,"No, Kitty! I don't have anything!
"
3,7,Kitty,"Meow rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
"
3,7,Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!
"
3,7,Kitty,"Rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
"
3,7,Cartman,"No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty! 
"
3,7,Liane,"Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Uh-huh.
"
3,7,Liane,"Be good.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Right.
"
3,7,Liane,"Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Aw, Ma.
"
3,7,Liane,"Eskimo kisses for Mom-my!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Jesus Christ. 
"
3,7,Liane,"Bye, kids. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry!  Ow!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!
"
3,7,Cartman,"You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV? 
"
3,7,Shelly,"My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!
"
3,7,Cartman,"You're not allowed to have people over!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Move! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Figure it out, turd!
"
3,7,Cartman,"God damnit!  Shut up, Kitty!  Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha!  I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd! 
"
3,7,Shelly,"...So I said, ""you're a little turd!"" and he w-
"
3,7,Cartman,"Damnit! 
"
3,7,Shelly,"...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night-
"
3,7,Cartman,"Ey! I need to use the phone!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah! 
"
3,7,Shelly,"I placed his underwear over his head.
"
3,7,Cartman,"I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!!  SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!! 
"
3,7,Announcer,"And now, back to the movie of the week, Aliens.
"
3,7,Newt,"They mostly come at night, mostly.
"
3,7,Cartman,"They mostly come at night, mostly.  Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Well, I'm watching Friends, turd!  That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces. 
"
3,7,Dude,"Hey there, is Shelly around?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Who the hell are you?
"
3,7,Dude,"I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot up your ass if you don't tell me where Shelly is!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Hey, Skyler.
"
3,7,Cartman,"You know this guy?
"
3,7,Shelly,"He's my boyfriend! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Christ, he's like 50 years old!
"
3,7,Shelly,"He's 22! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Dude, that's not cool.
"
3,7,Shelly,"You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!
"
3,7,Skyler,"Ye Yeah-ha.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly.  Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God damnit!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments 
"
3,7,Announcer,"And now, back to Wild Animal World
"
3,7,Host,"Here in the more arid regions of Africa, the gold-coat lions are in the throes of mating season.  The male lion positions himself behind the female and prepares to insert his lionhood. Notice his large swollen balls.  The female lion relaxes her body and says ""hello"" to Mr. Winky.  The male lion is enticed by the female's supple breasts and firm backside.  Quickly and suddenly, the male is finished. Now he wants to be alone, so he kindly asks the female to leave. He promises he'll call her tomorrow. But the female doesn't leave. Nope, she's moving right in. Looks like the male lion... is screwed. 
"
3,7,Skyler,"Mmmmm. 
"
3,7,Shelly,"No, Skyler. Quit it.
"
3,7,Skyler,"Come on, babe. How long have we known each other?
"
3,7,Shelly,"Eight days tomorrow.
"
3,7,Skyler,"And I still don't get any action.
"
3,7,Shelly,"I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all.
"
3,7,Skyler,"But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.
"
3,7,Shelly,"Well, maybe just one kiss.
"
3,7,Skyler,"Mmmmm 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Hey, what are you doing? 
"
3,7,Skyler,"Beat it, chubby!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Go on, Astroturd!
"
3,7,Skyler,"Mmmmm 
"
3,7,Cartman,"I'm gonna tell my mom on you.
"
3,7,Shelly,"Turd Rock From the Sun!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Ey! You ate all the pizza!
"
3,7,Shelly,"We left you some crusts! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass! 
"
3,7,Shelly,"Guess again, Richard the Turd!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Give me that phone number!
"
3,7,Skyler,"Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
"
3,7,Kitty,"Meow.
"
3,7,Cartman,"God damnit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. 
"
3,7,Kitty,"Meow.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip. 
"
3,7,Kitty,"Meowrowrowrowrowrowrowrowr. 
"
3,7,Skyler,"Red Rocket spills my icy soul.
Demons from Hell seek the chosen one!
"
3,7,Shelly,"You're such an amazing poet, Skyler.
"
3,7,Skyler,"Isn't this guitar awesome? It's the best of its kind, and not a scratch on it. 
"
3,7,Shelly,"Skyler, not here.
"
3,7,Skyler,"I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them. 
"
3,7,Shelly,"Really?
"
3,7,Skyler,"I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar.
"
3,7,Shelly,"Wow!
"
3,7,Skyler,"When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff.
"
3,7,Shelly,"O Skyler, I love you. 
"
3,7,Skyler,"Mmmmm. 
"
3,7,Shelly,"What the-?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Give me that picture!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Aaaaa!  Yes!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Open this door, Turdledove!
"
3,7,Cartman,"I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you. 
"
3,7,Shelly,"Give me that picture, turd!
"
3,7,Cartman,"You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
"
3,7,Shelly,"I'm gonna bust this door down! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? 
"
3,7,Clyde,"We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!  That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! 
"
3,7,Kitty,"Meow. Meow. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Oh! God damnit!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Who is that?!
"
3,7,Skyler,"Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice. 
"
3,7,Shelly,"Skyler, your band can't practice here.
"
3,7,Skyler,"Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe!  'Sup Mark?  'Sup up. Jonesy? 
"
3,7,Shelly,"Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!
"
3,7,Cartman,"You just want me to open the door!
"
3,7,Shelly,"We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
"
3,7,Cartman,"What?? Ih- is she okay?
"
3,7,Shelly,"Not really. She's dead.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Huh?! 
"
3,7,Shelly,"Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!
"
3,7,Shelly,"HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!
"
3,7,Shelly,"You mean this one? 
"
3,7,Cartman,"O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, damnit!  AAAAH! 
"
3,7,Skyler,"Okay, check check, check, 1, 2, check. Okay, ready? All right, let's try the new song. This is a song I wrote for you, Shelly.

3,7,Cartman,"Aw, man, you guys suck.

3,7,Skyler,"Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly.

3,7,Mark,"Oh, really?!
"
3,7,Shelly,"I just think your sound is kind of... last week.
"
3,7,Jonesy,"Oh, I'd like to see you do any better, bitch!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Well, I do have a song I wrote.
"
3,7,Skyler,"O-kay, why don't you sing it for us?
"
3,7,Shelly,"Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed!
"
3,7,Skyler,"Hey man, don't be shy.
"
3,7,Shelly,"Uhwwell, okay.  I'll try. But I'm not promising anything. 
1, 2, 3, 4
So much pain in the world today.
Too many turds are headin' my way.
But we can press our turds together.
Passing by turds whenever.
"
3,7,Skyler,"Don't you know? Isn't...

3,7,Shelly,"Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do

"
3,7,Cartman,"Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!
"
3,7,Liane,"No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, there's a whole crappy band here!  Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them? 
"
3,7,Liane,"This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Damnit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?!
"
3,7,Liane,"Not really, hon.  Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour!  Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!
"
3,7,Mr. Mackey,"Mhm, mkay? 
"
3,7,Cartman,"I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here!  My Speak and Record bear. Of course.
"
3,7,Shelly,"In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!
"
3,7,Mark,"Dude, this is gay!
"
3,7,Skyler,"Shut up! 
"
3,7,Mark,"You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!
"
3,7,Jonesy,"Yeah, dude. What the hell is wrong with you, anyway? She's like, 12.
"
3,7,Skyler,"You guys, get out! Don't question my love! My love is as pure as morning snow! Get out, I said! 
"
3,7,Kitty,"Rowr!  (Rowrowrowrowr!) 
"
3,7,Oragne cat,"Rowr!
"
3,7,Kitty,"Rowr.  Hrowr!
"
3,7,Oragne cat,"Geuugh. 
"
3,7,Kitty,"Meowr!  Meowuh!  Oh meah!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Testing, testing, 1 2.  Sweet. 
"
3,7,Shelly,"We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Okay. See you in a while.
"
3,7,Shelly,"Wha-?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly.
"
3,7,Shelly,"What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
"
3,7,Shelly,"What?! No you don't!
"
3,7,Cartman,"No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.
"
3,7,Shelly,"...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Yuh, you mean it?
"
3,7,Shelly,"But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.
"
3,7,Shelly,"Shut up, turd!
"
3,7,Cartman,"That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
"
3,7,Shelly,"What are you doing?
"
3,7,Cartman,"I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?
"
3,7,Shelly,"Go away, turd!
"
3,7,Cartman,"I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler?  Agh!
"
3,7,Kitty,"Meow 
"
3,7,Skyler,"Yeah! Come on! Give it up!
"
3,7,Shelly,"No.
"
3,7,Skyler,"Give it up, babe!
"
3,7,Shelly,"NO!
"
3,7,Skyler,"Come on, babih!
"
3,7,Shelly,"No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you!
"
3,7,Skyler,"Why the hell not?!
"
3,7,Shelly,"'Cause I'm twelve! 
"
3,7,Skyler,"You're not putting out for me?
"
3,7,Shelly,"No!
"
3,7,Skyler,"Well then, screw you, bitch! I've got plenty of other girlfriends that will!
"
3,7,Shelly,"What?? But I thought you liked me.
"
3,7,Skyler,"If you're not puttin' out, then I'm movin' on! There's plenty of chicks like you out there!  Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Gotcha! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted!  Hey! I said, guess who's busted!  Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!
"
3,7,Shelly,"I don't care.  He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before.  I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
"
3,7,Shelly,"Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.
"
3,7,Cartman,"You're not ugly.
"
3,7,Shelly,"You don't think so?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
"
3,7,Shelly,"You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
"
3,7,Shelly,"Huh?
"
3,7,Cartman,"If you want, I could help you.
"
3,7,Shelly,"Really? You would do that?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Just let me get my cowboy hat.
"
3,7,Kitty,"Mreow? Mreow? Mreow! 
"
3,7,Skyler,"What the hell is this?!
"
3,7,Polly,"Help me! Help me! This is Salma Hayek. Is anybody there? 
"
3,7,Skyler,"Salma Hayek? Whoa, she's hot. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Okay, it's clear. 
"
3,7,Polly,"Over here! Please, come quick! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"We don't have much time!
"
3,7,Shelly,"This won't take me long!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Hurry up in there!
"
3,7,Shelly,"I'm almost done.
"
3,7,Skyler,"Hello-o? Hello-o, Mrs. Hayek?
"
3,7,Polly,"Over here! Please help me! I am lost and I have no clothes!
"
3,7,Skyler,"No clothes, right.
"
3,7,Polly,"I'm over here! Please help me! I will reward you greatly!
"
3,7,Skyler,"Right here, Miss Hayek!
"
3,7,Polly,"Oh, please help me!
"
3,7,Skyler,"What the? 
"
3,7,Polly,"Please help me! I will give you tacos!
"
3,7,Skyler,"Dude, somebody tricked me! I'll make you pay for making me come out here, God damnit!  Stupid asshole stuffed animals trying to ruin my night!  My guitar! NOOOOO!
"
3,7,Cartman,"That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Oh my God! 
"
3,7,Shelly,"They're having a cat orgy!
"
3,7,Cartman,"You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on.  That's it. Come on, come on.  Uh oh.
"
3,7,Skyler,"You two ruined my career! I'm gonna get you!  Umph  Ogh! Oh! Owey! Owwey! Duewy! Oh!  Oh, you ripped my pants off! Oh my God! Oohh my Goodd!
"
3,7,Shelly,"Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Yeah. I think we get along okay.
"
3,7,Liane,"Hi, kids. I'm home.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Heh.  Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!
"
3,7,Shelly,"No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.
"
3,7,Liane,"Oh, what a party that was!  Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. 
"
3,7,Shelly,"Wow, she passed out.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.
"
3,7,Shelly,"Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay.
"
3,7,Cartman,"That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's

"
3,8,Stan,"I don't want to go to this stupid party!
"
3,8,Randy,"Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.
"
3,8,Stan,"No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.
"
3,8,Randy,"Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm.
"
3,8,Randy,"Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement.
"
3,8,Stan,"Awww!
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Be sure to help yourselves to the crab soufflé, and uh, eh, Juanita?  Juanita?  We need some more finger sandwiches? 
"
3,8,Stan,"I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
"
3,8,Randy,"Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Here you go, it's right in here. 
"
3,8,Randy,"We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.
"
3,8,Stan,"Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
"
3,8,Sharon,"You have fun, Stanley.
"
3,8,Stan,"No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts. 
"
3,8,Pip,"Cheerio, Stahan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here.
"
3,8,Stan,"Shut up, Pip.
"
3,8,Butters,"Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.
"
3,8,Stan,"Butters, is there any way out of here?
"
3,8,Butters,"Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.
"
3,8,Dougie,"I like math.
"
3,8,Stan,"Oh my God.
"
3,8,Pip,"We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
"
3,8,Stan,"No.
"
3,8,Pip,"I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, ""Turrah!"" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar?  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.
"
3,8,All three,"Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. 
"
3,8,Mr. Garrison,"Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass.  No! Mr. Hat, you get back here! 
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.
"
3,8,Sharon,"Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while. 
"
3,8,Randy,"One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.
"
3,8,Sharon,"Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. 
"
3,8,Randy,"Yeah, experiment.
"
3,8,All three,"Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.
"
3,8,Pip,"Wickersham tally-ho ugh.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?
"
3,8,Stan,"Yes.
"
3,8,Dougie,"What are you? A sourpuss?
"
3,8,Butters,"Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh?  They got those thick noses and all.
"
3,8,Pip,"Hey, look at this!
"
3,8,Butters,"Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. 
"
3,8,Pip,"It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.
"
3,8,Dougie,"Neato.
"
3,8,Butters,"Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.
"
3,8,Stan,"Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me.
"
3,8,Pip,"Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?
"
3,8,Butters,"No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.
"
3,8,Pip,"Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed.  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?
"
3,8,Stan,"Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!
"
3,8,Pip,"Well.  Alrighty then.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week.
"
3,8,Gerald,"Wow, neat!
"
3,8,Sheila,"It looks quite inviting.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub.
"
3,8,Sharon,"Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut.
"
3,8,Randy,"Hell, we should get in.
"
3,8,Gerald,"Yeah.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?
"
3,8,Sharon,"Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hm huheh, that's okay. 
"
3,8,Sheila,"No hot tub for me!
"
3,8,Gerald,"Well, screw you guys! 
"
3,8,Randy,"I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo!
"
3,8,Sharon,"Oh, look at our boys, Sheila.  It's just like they're in college again.
"
3,8,Pip,"Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?
"
3,8,Butters,"Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?
"
3,8,Dougie,"How should I know?
"
3,8,Pip,"Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.
"
3,8,Butters,"Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. 
"
3,8,Stan,"What?
"
3,8,Pip,"Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?
"
3,8,Stan,"What do I have to do?
"
3,8,Butters,"Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
"
3,8,Stan,"Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.
"
3,8,Pip,"Oh, that's a splendid mission!
"
3,8,Butters,"Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! 
"
3,8,Dougie,"Which Angel am I again?
"
3,8,Randy,"Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?
"
3,8,Gerald,"Yeah, I know what you mean.
"
3,8,Randy,"I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.
"
3,8,Gerald,"Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  Only 'cause I've never smoked before. 
"
3,8,Randy,"Good idea.
"
3,8,Gerald,"What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
"
3,8,Randy,"Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.
"
3,8,Gerald,"Yeah! ...Was that your leg?
"
3,8,Randy,"Huh? Oh, you mean, this?
"
3,8,Gerald,"Yeah.
"
3,8,Randy,"Yeah. That, that was me.
"
3,8,Pip,"Bosley! Bosley!
"
3,8,Stan,"What, Pip?
"
3,8,Pip,"Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
"
3,8,Stan,"What the hell do you want?!
"
3,8,Pip,"Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs.
"
3,8,Stan,"You did? 
"
3,8,Dougie,"Air shaft.
"
3,8,Butters,"Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.
"
3,8,Pip,"So Bosley, what's our next mission?
"
3,8,Stan,"We're going upstairs.
"
3,8,Butters,"Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
"
3,8,Stan,"Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! 
"
3,8,Randy,"Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.
"
3,8,Gerald,"She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
"
3,8,Randy,"O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.
"
3,8,Gerald,"I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
"
3,8,Randy,"With two girls or two guys?
"
3,8,Gerald,"Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... 
"
3,8,Randy,"You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.
"
3,8,Gerald,"You haven't?
"
3,8,Randy,"No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?
"
3,8,Gerald,"Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy.
"
3,8,Randy,"Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?
"
3,8,Gerald,"NO, no, uh I don't think so.
"
3,8,Randy,"...Well it is a night for experimenting.
"
3,8,Gerald,"Sure is. 
"
3,8,Randy,"Okay, I'll start. 
"
3,8,ATF lead,"This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there.
"
3,8,ATF agent,"Code 7. We believe we have found the compound. Request immediate backup. 
"
3,8,Barbrady,"Okay, so just what is going on here, people?
"
3,8,ATF lead,"Get down! 
"
3,8,Barbrady,"What?
"
3,8,ATF lead,"It's just like we told you, officer! There's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts. 
"
3,8,Barbrady,"Are you sure?
"
3,8,ATF lead,"Of course we're sure!  We're the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It's our job to know what these fanatics do!
"
3,8,Barbrady,"So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
"
3,8,ATF lead,"Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them.
"
3,8,ATF lead,"What's the situation?
"
3,8,ATF agent,"Apparently, we've got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts.
"
3,8,ATF lead,"Any luck talking to somebody in the house?
"
3,8,ATF agent,"We've tried calling, but there's no answer. I think we're gonna have to move in, sir.
"
3,8,ATF lead,"Alright. Johnson!
"
3,8,Johnson,"Sir!
"
3,8,ATF lead,"I'm sending you in. Watch your ass.
"
3,8,Johnson,"Yes, sir! 
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay?  Would you like a meteor mai tai?
"
3,8,Johnson,"Heeey, I love mai tais! 
"
3,8,Pip,"We did it! Great job, Angels!
"
3,8,Butters,"So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?
"
3,8,Stan,"Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.
"
3,8,Pip,"What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?
"
3,8,Stan,"I don't care, just hurry! 
"
3,8,Butters,"Well, hooray!
"
3,8,Gerald,"So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.
"
3,8,Randy,"...Yeah.
"
3,8,Gerald,"Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?
"
3,8,Randy,"No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?
"
3,8,Gerald,"Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.
"
3,8,Randy,"Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. 
"
3,8,Gerald,"Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.
"
3,8,Randy,"Um... Yeah yeah sure sure. 
"
3,8,ATF lead,"Damn it, where is Johnson?!
"
3,8,ATF agent,"No communication, sir. It doesn't look good for him.
"
3,8,ATF lead,"Those bastards!
"
3,8,Man,"Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Well, are you sure you have to leave so early?
"
3,8,Woman,"We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay? 
"
3,8,ATF lead,"Hold it right there! Whatever it is you are intending to do, do not do it!  Your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan!
"
3,8,Man,"What?
"
3,8,ATF lead,"Do not move, or we will be forced to shoot-  God damn it, who was that?!  Did you see them move?!
"
3,8,Agent 1,"...I did.
"
3,8,Agent 2,"Yah.
"
3,8,Agent 3,"Yeah, they moved alright.
"
3,8,Jimbo,"Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year.
"
3,8,Burly man,"Eh that's true, but Elway was the heart of the team. Who's the leader now?
"
3,8,Blond man,"I think the Jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the AFC.
"
3,8,Randy,"Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?
"
3,8,Jimbo,"...What??
"
3,8,Randy,"Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.
"
3,8,Burly man,"Well... Let's go kick his ass!
"
3,8,Other men,"Yeah!
"
3,8,Jimbo,"Where is he?!
"
3,8,Randy,"Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.
"
3,8,Burly man,"Aw! 
"
3,8,Gerald,"Hey, Randy. What are you doing? 
"
3,8,Randy,"Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
"
3,8,Gerald,"Can I come with you?
"
3,8,Randy,"Okay. 
"
3,8,Butters,"Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', ""Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?"" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.
"
3,8,Stan,"Rad! 
"
3,8,Pip,"Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?
"
3,8,Stan,"There are no more missions. I have everything I want. 
"
3,8,Butters,"Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
"
3,8,Stan,"Just... play something else! God!
"
3,8,Pip,"Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.
"
3,8,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts.
"
3,8,Stan,"Whoa, cool!
"
3,8,Dougie,"I wanna be a reporter someday.
"
3,8,Reporter,"Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house.  According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued.
"
3,8,Pip,"Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.
"
3,8,Reporter,"The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks.  The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside.
"
3,8,Stan,"Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
"
3,8,Dougie,"Do you think someday I can be a reporter?
"
3,8,Reporter,"We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house  showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards!
"
3,8,Stan,"Dude!
"
3,8,Butters,"Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?
"
3,8,Pip,"Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.
"
3,8,Gerald,"Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you.
"
3,8,Randy,"I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
"
3,8,Gerald,"So, so now we can't be friends?
"
3,8,Randy,"I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.
"
3,8,Gerald,"We said we'd never tell anybody?
"
3,8,Randy,"Well, of course we wouldn't.
"
3,8,Gerald,"Oh, uh I didn't realize that. 
"
3,8,Randy,"Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?
"
3,8,Gerald,"Well, uh uh a few people, yeah.
"
3,8,Randy,"What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
"
3,8,Gerald,"You didn't say not to tell anyone.
"
3,8,Randy,"Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! 
"
3,8,Gerald,"Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
"
3,8,Randy,"AAAW!! 
"
3,8,Stan,"Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. 
"
3,8,Butters,"Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?
"
3,8,Stan,"Mom, go look outside.
"
3,8,Sharon,"Mommy's little boopie-kins 
"
3,8,Butters,"Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! 
"
3,8,Stan,"Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. 
"
3,8,ATF lead,"Lay down your weapons!
"
3,8,Stan,"We don't have any weapons.
"
3,8,ATF lead,"Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them. 
"
3,8,Butters,"Whoa!
"
3,8,Stan,"Get back inside! 
"
3,8,ATF lead,"I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique.
"
3,8,Barbardy,"What's the Ganz technique?
"
3,8,ATF lead,"This is what we did in Waco.  Play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out.  Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will.
"
3,8,Mr. Garrison,"That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.
"
3,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, hell, turn it up.
"
3,8,Goateed man,"Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he's gay.
"
3,8,Other man,"Oh, is he?
"
3,8,Randy,"Who?!
"
3,8,Goateed man,"Huh?
"
3,8,Randy,"Who who did you hear is, is gay?!
"
3,8,Goateed man,"Ricky Martin, the singer.
"
3,8,Randy,"Oh. 
"
3,8,Gerald,"Hey, Randy, what's up?
"
3,8,Randy,"What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
"
3,8,Gerald,"Huh?
"
3,8,Randy,"Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
"
3,8,Gerald,"Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
"
3,8,Randy,"There's nothing to talk about.
"
3,8,Gerald,"You're having regrets, aren't you?
"
3,8,Randy,"No, I-... I don't know.
"
3,8,Gerald,"Hey. Talk to me.
"
3,8,Randy,"No!
"
3,8,Gerald,"I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
"
3,8,Randy,"Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
"
3,8,Gerald,"Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do.
"
3,8,Randy,"Aaww!  Sharon?  Sharon, cuh can we go?
"
3,8,Sharon,"Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.
"
3,8,Randy,"Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.
"
3,8,Sharon,"Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!
"
3,8,Randy,"Ogh, I already did.
"
3,8,Stan,"Dad! Dad, they shot at us.
"
3,8,Randy,"Not now, Stanley. 
"
3,8,Stan,"Mom!
"
3,8,Sharon,"Whoopee! 
"
3,8,Butters,"Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.
"
3,8,Stan,"Get a hold of yourself, man!
"
3,8,Butters,"How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?
"
3,8,Stan,"Come on. We have to find out what's happening. 
"
3,8,Reporter,"I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest?
"
3,8,Ganz,"We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now.
"
3,8,Dougie,"See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
"
3,8,Reporter,"So what are your plans, commander?
"
3,8,Ganz,"Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out.
"
3,8,Butters,"Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-
"
3,8,Stan,"Sh!
"
3,8,Reporter,"Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander.
"
3,8,Ganz,"It is, but we can't let them kill themselves.
"
3,8,Stan,"We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
"
3,8,Pip,"But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
"
3,8,Butters,"Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.
"
3,8,Stan,"Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. 
"
3,8,Reporter,"For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out.
"
3,8,Mackey,"Hoh, look. Harold's doing it again, hm huh hnmkay? 
"
3,8,Dougie,"This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party.  As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us.  Anything else?
"
3,8,Stan,"Tell them not to burn us down.
"
3,8,Dougie,"Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news.
"
3,8,Pip,"Now what do we do?
"
3,8,Stan,"Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
"
3,8,Dougie,"Hey, I'm a real reporter.
"
3,8,Stan,"You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. 
"
3,8,Ganz,"Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And back rubs.  Alright, I'm through trying to reason with them. Send in the Negotiator! 
"
3,8,Reporter,"Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics?
"
3,8,Ganz,"We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.
"
3,8,Reporter,"Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves.
"
3,8,Ganz,"Look. You see this? You see this?
"
3,8,Reporter,"Yes.
"
3,8,Ganz,"You see it? You see it? Go get it.  Go get it!  Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass!
"
3,8,Gerald,"Having a good time?
"
3,8,Randy,"Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?
"
3,8,Gerald,"I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-
"
3,8,Randy,"We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! 
"
3,8,Guest,"Good night, everyone.
"
3,8,Ganz,"Look out!  Ho-old your fire! Okay, hrm.  People at the door! That was a warning! Go back inside and tell the others that they now have one minute to surrender! 
"
3,8,Stan,"Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?
"
3,8,Butters,"Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?
"
3,8,Stan,"We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. 
"
3,8,Butters,"Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.
"
3,8,Stan,"Can you hit a target, Pip?
"
3,8,Pip,"I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire. 
"
3,8,Stan,"Hit something nice and solid now. 
"
3,8,Pip,"I think that's got it.
"
3,8,Stan,"Nice job, Pip.
"
3,8,Pip,"Did I do a nice job? Really?
"
3,8,Stan,"Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. 
"
3,8,Butters,"Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Waaah!  Gooh. 
"
3,8,Stan,"He made it down. 
"
3,8,Ganz,"Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command! 
"
3,8,Butters,"Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?
"
3,8,Reporter,"Huh?
"
3,8,Butters,"Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. 
"
3,8,Gerald,"Honey?
"
3,8,Randy,"God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows.
"
3,8,Gerald,"Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
"
3,8,Randy,"What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
"
3,8,Gerald,"I just want to know it meant something to you.
"
3,8,Randy,"It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! 
"
3,8,Man in briefs,"Aw, I was just in the hot tub. 
"
3,8,Randy,"Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!
"
3,8,Mackey,"Uh. Well, it's not like you're the only guy who's ever watched another guy masturbate; I've done it.
"
3,8,Ned,"Mmm-me too. 
"
3,8,Man 1,"Yeah, uh I've done it a few times.
"
3,8,Man 2,"Yep.
"
3,8,Man 3,"Yup.
"
3,8,Man 4,"Uh huh.
"
3,8,Man 5,"Me too.
"
3,8,Man 6,"Myeup, me too.
"
3,8,Man 7,"Yup.
"
3,8,Jimbo,"Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. 
"
3,8,Mackey,"Uh, Juanita, could you fix some more dip, please, Juanita? 
"
3,8,Randy,"You mean it? I'm not gay?
"
3,8,Jimbo,"Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
"
3,8,Randy,"Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!
"
3,8,Gerald,"So we're friends again?
"
3,8,Randy,"Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!
"
3,8,Ganz,"Alright everyone, fire!
"
3,8,Reporter,"Hold on just a minute! This is Derek Smalls reporting. We have just received an exclusive video from inside the house , proving that the people inside are not cultists after all.
"
3,8,Ganz,"Uh oh.  Uh uh attention everyone! This has only been a test. Good job, men, on this, uh, simulation.
"
3,8,Blond agent,"Simulation?
"
3,8,Ganz,"Sh.  All is well. Do not shoot at 
"
3,8,Pip,"O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day! 
"
3,8,Ganz,"Woops.
"
3,8,ATF agent,"Sir, this isn't gonna look good.
"
3,8,Ganz,"You're right. Quick, let's get out of here! 
"
3,8,Derek,"Say, that was a fine piece of journalism, boys.
"
3,8,Dougie,"Wow, you mean that?
"
3,8,Derek,"Sure. Why, with your tape, I'll be able to make millions and further my career beyond my wildest dreams. 
"
3,8,Butters,"Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!
"
3,8,Pip,"There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.
"
3,8,Butters,"Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.
"
3,8,Stan,"But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
"
3,8,Butters,"Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
"
3,8,Kyle,"Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
"
3,8,Stan,"You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
"
3,8,Kyle,"Hoh, dude, weak.
"
3,8,Stan,"Super weak.
"
3,8,Kyle,"Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. 
"
3,9,Sheila,"Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?
"
3,9,Gerald,"I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!
"
3,9,Sheila,"Kyle!
"
3,9,Kyle,"I'm coming, Ma! 
"
3,9,Sheila,"Go get the door, Kyle!
"
3,9,Kyle,"""Get ready"", ""answer the door"", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! 
"
3,9,Kyle,"Oh! Hey, Kenny.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)
"
3,9,Kyle,"I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What's that?)
"
3,9,Kyle,"It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Oh, that's alright.)
"
3,9,Kyle,"Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Really?) 
"
3,9,Kyle,"Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
"
3,9,Sheila,"...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing.
"
3,9,Kyle,"...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Aw.)
"
3,9,Sheila,"No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids. 
"
3,9,Gerald,"You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
3,9,Sheila,"Kyle, eh, the problem is...
"
3,9,Kyle,"Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
"
3,9,Gerald,"Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
3,9,Sheila,"Come on, Ike!  It's time to go to Squirts!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Squirts?)
"
3,9,Sheila,"You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Oh.)
"
3,9,Sheila,"Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there. 
"
3,9,Sheila,"And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, ""Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid.""
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Uh huh.)
"
3,9,Sheila,"Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Uh huh!)
"
3,9,Ike,"Eng jeck. 
"
3,9,Kyle,"No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
"
3,9,Sheila,"Ike, you behave!
"
3,9,Ike,"Buwor? 
"
3,9,Kyle,"No, Ike!
"
3,9,Ike,"Buh buh buh buh. 
"
3,9,Kyle,"I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
"
3,9,Gerald,"Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout.
"
3,9,Ike,"No-o. 
"
3,9,Gerald,"Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.
"
3,9,Kyle,"What? You want me to lie?
"
3,9,Gerald,"Yeah, lie.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--
"
3,9,Sheila,"Oh my God, what is that?! 
"
3,9,Gerald,"Hey, it's a bear! 
"
3,9,Kyle,"Wow, cool.
"
3,9,Sheila,"This retreat really is out of the way, isn't it?
"
3,9,Ranger,"Welcome to Jewbilee. You folks find it okay?
"
3,9,Gerald,"Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back.
"
3,9,Kyle,"He was huge.
"
3,9,Ranger,"Yeah. We spotted him a few days ago. Nothing to worry about, though. Your boys are safe with us.
"
3,9,Sheila,"I'm sure they are.
"
3,9,Gerald,"We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.
"
3,9,Sheila,"Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Uh huh?)
"
3,9,Sheila,"Try and act Jewish. 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(How do you do that?)
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Come on, Squirt! We're meeting over here! 
"
3,9,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"I'm the Squirt leader. I don't want to be the Squirt leader, but I don't have a choice; it's the only way I can earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend all night instructing Squirts.
"
3,9,Kyle,"You have to go with him, Ike.
"
3,9,Ike,"Buh buh buh buh.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 
"
3,9,Ike,"Boul ball.
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Come on! 
"
3,9,Ranger,"Name?
"
3,9,Kyle,"Kyle Broflovski.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Kenny McCormick.)
"
3,9,Ranger,"What?
"
3,9,Kyle,"Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.
"
3,9,Ranger,"Alright, get to Meshuggeneh Hall! The meeting is already starting.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What's that?) 
"
3,9,Kyle,"This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Baleilah hazein, Hame kadesh mekoh hikenazu puanazikeh hakeilah. (Now gather us, the elders, on this most holy of nights.)
"
3,9,Elders,"Helalelah, het Moshe. (Praise Moses.)
"
3,9,Chief elder,"I want to welcome you all. Though we each come from a different sect of Judaism, on this night of Jewbilee, we all pray to Moses as one. Hineinih kureh leirukeshu. (May all the power of Moses show the way...) Now, let us all introduce ourselves.
"
3,9,Elder 1,"Elder Carn, from the Orthodox synagogue.
"
3,9,Elder 2,"Elder Harris, from the Hasidic sect.
"
3,9,Elder 3,"Elder Garth, from the synagogue of anti-Semites.
"
3,9,Chief elder,"I don't believe I've heard of the anti-Semitic sect of Judaism before.
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"We're new.
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Okay, Squirts, the elders have given us a very important task tonight. We are all going to make macaroni pictures, like this one,  using dry macaroni, paper, and glue.
"
3,9,Squirt 1,"How come we have to make macaroni pictures?
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Because that's what Squirts do! Now, shut your pie-hole!
"
3,9,Squirt 2,"What's your name?
"
3,9,Ike,"No.
"
3,9,Squirt 2,"How come your head is lookin' so... funny-looking?
"
3,9,Ike,"Uh-uh. 
"
3,9,Elder,"And that's how we'll be making tonight's craft. And so you see, Scouts, all you need is a bar of soap and a dull knife , and you can make nifty soap sculptures like these. Here's a giraffe.  And here's a cloud.  You can all pick up your bars of soap later on, as we will all be making soap sculptures tonight.  Now, this year we are pleased to announce that Jewbilee has grown to over one hundred Jew Scouts from all around the country. All new inductees, raise your hands. 
"
3,9,Kyle,"That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. 
"
3,9,Elder,"Uhhhh, yess, and what is your name, young man?
"
3,9,Inductee,"Junichi.
"
3,9,Elder,"O-oh, wonderful, uh, uh, um...  Cu-could you run out and grab some... some of those candles for us?  There we go. Ahem.  Now, I would like all the new inductees to step forward, please. 
"
3,9,Kyle,"This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 
"
3,9,Elder,"Raise your left hand and repeat after me: I pledge to be a Jew Scout.

3,9,Elder,"My honor, wide and true.
"
3,9,Inductees,"My honor, wide and true.
"
3,9,Elder,"I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
"
3,9,Inductees,"I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
"
3,9,Elder,"Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew.
"
3,9,Inductees,"Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew.

3,9,Inductee 2,"Nahit chaim. 
"
3,9,Elder,"Nahit chaim.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Nahit chaim.)  (Ha! Hiheh haha.)  (Hah! Oh my God!)
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Okay, Squirts, let's see what you made macaroni pictures of. Ishmael?
"
3,9,Ishmael,"Apple.
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Good. Matthew?
"
3,9,Matthew,"Cat.
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Joseph?
"
3,9,Joseph,"Triangle.
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Okay. Ike?
"
3,9,Ike,"Cokeshen.
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"...You don't make a macaroni picture of the Last Supper at a Jewish camp!  What the geez?  Oh my God, it's that bear they've been talking about!  Where did it go?! Squirts, go grab your gear! We're gonna hunt us a bear! Then I'll get my chutzpah badge for sure!
"
3,9,Chief Elder,"Elehem hav dorim, ashoseveh laoleinu. Hakadosh boruku, omasheh hachreit. (Tonight, for the meteor shower, we will pray to Moses. Then we will give Moses thanks.)
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Oh, enough already. What has Moses ever done for us?
"
3,9,Chief elder,"All sects of Judaism follow the words of Moses.
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Not mine. Tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the New Time, heh. We should use it to pray to Haman and enter into a new millennium faith, and it--
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here!
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"All you ever do is worship Moses, but it says in the Book of Centuries that Haman will one day lead the Jews.
"
3,9,Elder Harris,"We pray to Moses here, elder.
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?!
"
3,9,Chief elder,"We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here!
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Fine!  Jewbilee is the time of Haman! You will all see how wrong you are, very soon! When Haman returns from the Ninth Tower of Disillusionment, and smotes Moses and all his followers into pillars of dust that would cry for their petty lives but can't, having recently been turned into dust and all, you will see! You will see this very night! 
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Hello.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What the fuck are we doing?)
"
3,9,Kyle,"This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Uheheheheh, that's stupid.)
"
3,9,Kyle,"It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Alright, Jew Scouts, the meteor shower will start soon. Let's pray to Moses for guidance.  Moses, great leader, on this blessed night of Jewbilee, we ask for your tutelage.
"
3,9,Scouts,"May the teachings of Moses fill our ears and our hearts respectively.
"
3,9,All,"O...
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Stupid assholes. Moses ain't gonna teach them anything!  Do not fear, Haman. This night shall be yours, and the anti-Semitic Jews will once again rule the Earth.
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"We are Squirts, we are Squirts; we're so kosher that it hurtsWhen we get older we'll be Scouts, but until then we are Squirts There he is, Squirts.  Okay, Squirts. Remember the plan: immobilize and attack. Matthew, y-you immobilize the bear with the net, then Echo team, run up and attack it with your Squirt knives.  Don't get too close now, just close enough to throw the net on the stupid bear.  Now! 
"
3,9,Matthew,"Oh, funt.  No!
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Oh, no!  Oh, God!  Oh, the bear took a Squirt. Oh, I'm gonna get it now!
"
3,9,All,"O... 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What's happening now?)
"
3,9,Kyle,"Shh. Shut up, Kenny. 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What the fuck is that?!)
"
3,9,Kyle,"That's Moses, stupid! 
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Great Moses, we, your most loyal followers, want to thank you a lot for coming.
"
3,9,Moses,"The hour of Jewbilee is near. Let all debts be forgiven and all slaves freed. Mwaaaaaaaaaah!
"
3,9,All,"Aaaaaaaaaah!
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Alright Scouts, let's all show Moses our soap sculptures so that he may rejoice and be pleased. 
"
3,9,Kyle,"It's a duck. 
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"""And it was foretold that the spirit of Moses would finally rest when his spirit was imprisoned by Haman in a conch shell of blind faith."" Conch shell, like this one, hnee. 
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Moses, the Squirts have made you tidings of macaroni pictures. They should be here any second.  Where the hell are the Squirts?  We need those macaroni pictures for Moses right now!
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Now, we'll just see how Mr. Bear likes rat poison.  Well now, that'll be enough to kill a stupid bear. Okay, raise the tray!  Chutzpah badge, here I come.  Yikes!  Okay, here he comes. Easy now. Easy, Squirts.  Okay, Squirt, lower the tray.  That's it. That's it, you god-damned stupid bearface! 
"
3,9,Squirt,"Agghhh!  Ah--!  Agghhh!
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Jesus! Hell, he got another Squirt!
"
3,9,Ike,"Mommy.
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"You think you can stop me from getting my chutzpah badge, you stupid bear?! Think again!
"
3,9,All,"Kumbaya, my Lord, KumbayaO Lord, Kumbaya
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Great and honorable Moses, what do you desire from us, your children?
"
3,9,Moses,"I desire...  I desire... mamaroni pictures.
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Yeh yes, yes, the macaroni pictures are coming right away. Uh, anything else you want from us, O great leader of the people?
"
3,9,Moses,"I desire... popcorn necklaces.
"
3,9,Chief elder,"You heard him. Get to making popcorn necklaces right away!  All you need is some popcorn, and a needle and thread. 
"
3,9,Moses,"Hold!  There is... an impurity.
"
3,9,Garth,"Oh no, he's on to me, Haman.
"
3,9,Chief elder,"An impurity, Moses?
"
3,9,Moses,"This child here is not kosher.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Uh-oh.)  (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)
"
3,9,Kyle,"Don't worry. I know what to do.
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Scout Broflovski, have you defiled Jew Scouts by bringing a non-Hebrew to Jewbilee?! 
"
3,9,Kyle,"Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What?!) 
"
3,9,Chief elder,"A non-Jew has infiltrated Jew Scouts and looked upon the face of Moses! He must be dealt with!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)
"
3,9,Chief elder,"You are banished from here. You must leave before the great eating of carrot cake.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
3,9,Kyle,"He doesn't get cake?
"
3,9,Moses,"No cake for the impurity.
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Go now. You do not belong here. 
"
3,9,Moses,"Aaggghhh! 
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Infatu camdavid. David hakum ba'ikan shtud!
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Elder, what are you doing?!
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht!
"
3,9,Elder Harris,"He's reading from the Book of Haman!
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Enter the conch shell, Moses! 
"
3,9,Moses,"Eo! Eh! Diu! 
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"And there you shall stay, trapped for all eternity!
"
3,9,Chief elder,"Elder, what have you done?
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"I told you, the meteor shower is the time of Haman! I am running Jewbilee now!
"
3,9,Elder,"Release Moses, now!
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"I don't think so. 
"
3,9,Scout,"When do we get to eat carrot cake?
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Now... All of you into that building, or I shoot you where you stand!
"
3,9,Chief Elder,"Elder, you cannot mean--
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Move!  Now! Now, Haman, your time has come!
"
3,9,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell is going on?!
"
3,9,Chief elder,"If he summons Haman, we will all be destroyed.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Oh no!)
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"We are Jew Squirts, we know JewishStick stick smiley smiley Stick stick smiley smileydur dur dur dur dur--Hold it, Squirts! This is where we'll set our trap. Everyone remember your squadron. Alpha-5 and Gamma-7 will be on recon teams. Alpha will take left flank and flush the bear out of sector three. Once we're in position, I want constant contact between all squad leaders. We'll flush him out and we'll attack him! 
"
3,9,Squirt,"Agh! Agghh! 
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Remember, this is only a bear. All we have to do is stick together, and we can spend the rest of the night making bear sandwiches!  Where's Zigmal?
"
3,9,Ike,"No.
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"God-damnit! You stupid god-damned son of a bear, you've taken your last Squirt! Do you hear me?!
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"And the Ancient One looked upon Haman as the new leader of the people!  And it was the night that stars flew around the sky!  Yes! Yess!!
"
3,9,Chief elder,"If he summons Haman, it will be the end of everything we hold dear.
"
3,9,Scout,"I wanna go home.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Stop!)  (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!)  (Shit!)
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"That bear thinks he can outsmart me! Well, I'm not gonna let a stupid bear get the--  Hold! Look over there!  It's one of the Squirts the bear took. Maybe he's okay.  It's a trap!!  Damn! Damn, damn, damn! Okay, bear, that does it! You wanna kill all the Squirts?! You can have 'em! I give up! I don't need my chutzpah badge, or Jew Scouts, or any of this crap! Forget it!
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Let the New Tide turn! Let Haman rule his people once again!
"
3,9,Chief elder,"No! 
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"We await your return, Haman!  Your passage is safe from the enemies!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Aghh!)
"
3,9,Chief Elder,"It's hopeless.
"
3,9,Elder,"Haman will be summoned and we will be forced to obey him, or die. 
"
3,9,Elder Harris,"Uh I'm fine with obeying.
"
3,9,Elder,"Yeah, obeying should work out swell. 
"
3,9,Kyle,"Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
"
3,9,Elder 2,"How?
"
3,9,Kyle,"Kenny will find a way.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Haaarrrrrh!)  (Huh?)
"
3,9,Squirt,"Hey, welcome to the party.  See this li'l bear cub? It's his birthday.
"
3,9,Squirt 2,"Yeah, so his mommy brought us all over to play with him.
"
3,9,Bear cub,"Mrar.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Aww.)  (Okay, you guys, we've gotta get back to the camp and... )
"
3,9,Squirt,"They are? Uh oh.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)
"
3,9,Squirt,"Come on, Squirts. We have to help them.
"
3,9,All,"Yeah! 
"
3,9,Squirt leader,"Elder Schwartz, I lost the Squirts! I lost all the Squirts!  Well, screw you too! I don't need your Chutzpah badge anyway! Hello? 
"
3,9,Elder Schwartz,"Shlomo, get us out of here!
"
3,9,Shlomo,"What the geez?  What are you guys doing in there?
"
3,9,Elder Schwartz,"Get the keys and unlock the door! 
"
3,9,Schlomo,"What?!
"
3,9,Elder Schwartz,"Get the keys and unlock the door!
"
3,9,Schlomo,"I lost the Squirts! 
"
3,9,Elder Schwartz,"Look out!
"
3,9,Schlomo,"Huh? 
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Don't move!
"
3,9,Schlomo,"Oh, Jiminy gravy, what is this??
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"It's the summoning of Haman, fool! The awakening of a new kingdom, heeheh!
"
3,9,Schlomo,"You can't wake Haman. What would Moses say?
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Moses is trapped for all eternity in the conch of blind faith!
"
3,9,Schlomo,"Oh, no you don't!  Ooowww!!
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Enough of this waste of time!  Haman! The Great Summoning is done! Upon these words let your spirit come! Einich! Hos!
"
3,9,Elder Schwartz,"It is lost.
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Zayak. Kareem! 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Woohoo!) 
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Hey, give that back! 
"
3,9,Elder Schwartz,"It's the Squirts.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Go, Ike!
"
3,9,Elder Schwartz,"Unlock the door, Squirts! The keys are up there.
"
3,9,Elder Harris,"They'll never reach.
"
3,9,Squirt,"Squirts, fall in. Chinese formation. 
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Give me that book! 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Ow!) 
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Haman will deal with you! 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Ow!)
"
3,9,Elder Harris,"Oh, no. It's too late!
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Ramek shtud! 
"
3,9,Kyle,"What is that?
"
3,9,Elder Schwartz,"It is Haman.
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Yes! Yes! 
"
3,9,Haman,"Free! Free to punish those that imprisoned me!
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Haman! It's me, Garth! I freed you!
"
3,9,Kyle,"Look! 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(It's okay, I'll use my head!) 
"
3,9,Kyle,"Kenny! Noooooo!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Heeeeeyah! Ugh--!) 
"
3,9,Haman,"Moses! Nooo!
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"Nooo! Eheh. Nooo!  Moses. Uh I, I apologize for any inconvenience, eheh. Uh yuh you see, I was just uh--
"
3,9,Moses,"Die! 
"
3,9,Elder Garth,"No! Aaagghhh! Ooww..! 
"
3,9,All,"Hooray!
"
3,9,Kyle,"Kenny! 
"
3,9,Elder Harris,"That blow to his head must have killed him.
"
3,9,Elder Carn,"He saved us. He saved all the Jews.
"
3,9,Kyle,"You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
"
3,9,Elder Harris,"We've learned a lot from you and your great friend, Kenny.
"
3,9,Moses,"Every year we shall gather here in this special place and bring Kenny tidings of soap sculptures and macaroni pictures.
"
3,9,Elder Harris,"Yes.
"
3,9,Moses,"And those little shaker things where... you put beans inside of paper plates that are glued together.
"
3,9,Elder Harris,"Paper-plate bean shakers.
"
3,9,Moses,"And let us put patterns of glue on the outside of those paper plates so we can then pour glitter on them so they can look nice and sparkly.
"
3,9,Elder Schwartz,"You heard him, Scouts! Let's get to work!
"
3,10,Kitty,"Reowr.
"
3,10,Cartman,"No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!
"
3,10,Kitty,"Reowr.
"
3,10,Cartman,"No, Kitty! 
"
3,10,Kitty,"Roar?
"
3,10,Cartman,"No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?
"
3,10,Announcer,"Be sure to tune in tomorrow for another inexplicable episode of... Chinpokomon.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Hooray! 
"
3,10,Announcer,"Hey kids!  Do you love Chinpokomon?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Yes.
"
3,10,Announcer,"Well, now you can buy your very own! 
"
3,10,Singer,"I got to buy ChinpokomonI got to buy it, I got to buy it! 
"
3,10,Announcer,"Now you can collect them all. Furrycat, Donkeytron, Pengin, Shoe, Lambtor. Collect them all, and you can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!
"
3,10,Announcer,"All the Chinpokomon are in stores now.
"
3,10,Japanese Woman,"Chinpokomon is soo-peh-rior rubbeh toy, Nuhmbah 1!
"
3,10,Singer,"I got to buy it! Chinpo-ko-mon!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Mom! Mom!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!
"
3,10,Liane,"Eric, calm down. 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!
"
3,10,Liane,"What is it, Eric?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Muh-Mom, I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store.
"
3,10,Liane,"I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric.
"
3,10,Cartman,"...But Mo-o-om, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool.
"
3,10,Liane,"Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?
"
3,10,Cartman,"...But Mo-o-om, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!
"
3,10,Liane,"Alright! let's go. 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon. 
"
3,10,Girl,"Give it to me!
"
3,10,Boy,"Give it here!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Oh, god damnit! 
"
3,10,Stan,"Hey, fat ass.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Hey, dick-whore. I guess you saw the commercial, too.
"
3,10,Stan,"Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest.  God damnit, there's no more Pengins!  Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. 
"
3,10,Kenny,"(Nuh uh.) 
"
3,10,Cartman,"C'mon.
"
3,10,Kenny,"(Nuh uh!)
"
3,10,Cartman,"C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--
"
3,10,Kenny,"(No!)
"
3,10,Cartman,"C'mon.
"
3,10,Kenny,"(No!)
"
3,10,Cartman,"C'mon. Give me Pengin!
"
3,10,Kenny,"(No! This is mine!)
"
3,10,Cartman,"C'mon!
"
3,10,Sharon,"Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things.
"
3,10,Liane,"They're so strange. Where are they from?
"
3,10,Cashier,"Well, it's some new big thing from Japan. I tell you, those Japanese really know how to market to kids.
"
3,10,Japanese woman,"Own-ah Chinpokomon, and-ah you vill-ah have-ah happy feelings-eh. 
"
3,10,Kids,"Must collect Chinpokomon.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.
"
3,10,Kenny,"(Fuck you!)
"
3,10,Cartman,"God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!
"
3,10,Kyle,"Hey dudes.  What are those?
"
3,10,Stan,"What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
"
3,10,Kyle,"Huh?
"
3,10,Cartman,"You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon.
"
3,10,Kyle,"No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.
"
3,10,Stan,"Yeah, like ancient history.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
"
3,10,Stan,"No, dude!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
"
3,10,Cartman,"It's all Chinpokomon now.
"
3,10,Stan,"Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
"
3,10,Kyle,"What's the Primary Main Objective?
"
3,10,Cartman,"You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
"
3,10,Stan,"The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Well, what's the Evil Power?
"
3,10,Stan,"Ogh..!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!
"
3,10,Kyle,"What?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Duhhh!
"
3,10,Stan,"Yeah, get with the times, dude. 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Duhhh!
"
3,10,Kyle,"Shit!
"
3,10,Gerald,"Yeah, I guess so.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
"
3,10,Sheila,"What's a Chinpokomon?
"
3,10,Kyle,"I'm not sure.
"
3,10,Sheila,"Well, why do you need one?
"
3,10,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
3,10,Sheila,"...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
"
3,10,Gerald,"Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.
"
3,10,Ike,"Neah Kyle doh.
"
3,10,Gerald,"You see, son, fads come and go. And this ""Chin-po-ko-mon"" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, ""I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual."" Do you understand?
"
3,10,Kyle,"Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
"
3,10,Gerald,"Hm... Good point; here's $10. 
"
3,10,Kyle,"Thanks.
"
3,10,Gerald,"Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. 
"
3,10,Ike,"Hey, Chih-paw-ko.
"
3,10,Cashier,"There you go, son. I honestly don't know what you see in these things.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Neither do I. 
"
3,10,Cashier,"I guess I'll call it a night. 
"
3,10,A voice,"Chinpoko!  Buy me! Buy me!  When will you become Royal Chinpoko Master?  Hurry up and buy me.  Down with America!
"
3,10,Cashier,"What? 
"
3,10,Lambtron,"I love you. Let's be best friends, and destroy the capitalistic American government.
"
3,10,Cashier,"What the hell is goin' on here?
"
3,10,Kyle,"Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.
"

"
3,10,Red,"Well?
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"Uuuh.
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"That is so sturange.  I do not a-know how this could happen. But urest assured, I will make sure  it does not happong again!
"
3,10,Red,"Well, now, come on, I don't think that that quite satisfies my--
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"You are American?
"
3,10,Red,"Yes.
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"Ogh! You must have very big pee-anis!
"
3,10,Red,"Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"Nothing. We are very simple people. With very small penis. Mr. Ose penis is ...especially small.
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"Uh, smuh, so small.
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"We cannot achieve much with so small penis. But you! Americans. Wow! Penis so big! Soo big penis!
"
3,10,Red,"Well uh, he-I guess it is a pretty good size.
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"Minata, kite kite!  This-a man has veh-ry big penis!

"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"Hai. Hai, sachoo san.

3,10,Cartman,"I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"Amerika ni, kodomo zenbu Chinpokomon motte iru. Kore kara, ""phase two"" hajimete. IKIMASHOO!  The time has come! We will take Pearl Harbor!
"
3,10,Randy,"What are you doing?
"
3,10,Sharon,"I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.
"
3,10,Randy,"Why?
"
3,10,Sharon,"Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. 
"
3,10,Roostor,"Roo-oo-oostor! 
"
3,10,Randy,"...Are those good moral values?
"
3,10,Sharon,"I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
"
3,10,Narrator,"But Lambtron's powers also give him a good chance for a new fight. Will he succeed?
"
3,10,Sharon,"This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
"
3,10,Randy,"I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.
"
3,10,Sharon,"Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!
"
3,10,Randy,"Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.
"
3,10,Sharon,"No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.
"
3,10,Randy,"My God, you're right.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Come on, brothers and sistersWe've all got to join togetherJoin together and give me moneySo I can buy more Chinpokomon!We've got to stop this fight and...
"
3,10,Stan,"How's it goin', fat ass?
"
3,10,Cartman,"I haven't made any money yet.
"
3,10,Stan,"What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
"
3,10,Stan,"We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. 
"
3,10,Kyle,"I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!
"
3,10,Stan,"Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Camp?
"
3,10,Cartman,"The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
"
3,10,Stan,"You didn't know that?
"
3,10,Kyle,"No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 
"
3,10,Stan,"Dude, did you just say ""a-ight""?
"
3,10,Kyle,"Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!
"
3,10,Stan,"Yeah, dude. Nobody says ""a-ight"" anymore.
"
3,10,Kyle,"What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Like, eight days ago.
"
3,10,Kyle,"God damnit! 
"
3,10,Announcer,"Hey, kids!  Only one more day till the Chinpokomon camp!  Come early and enjoy all the Chinpoko fun! 
"
3,10,Singer,"Chinpokomon Camp!I've got to buy a ticket!I've got to buy one! A ticket!I've got to buy buy buy!
"
3,10,Japanese woman,"It'sa Satuhday anda Sunday. You can'ta wait to go! 
"
3,10,Singer,"Chinpokomon! 
"
3,10,Sharon,"We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel.
"
3,10,Liane,"Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.
"
3,10,Sheila,"Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.
"
3,10,Randy,"Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.
"
3,10,Sheila,"Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.
"
3,10,Sharon,"You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.
"
3,10,Sheila,"Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Get outta the way! Move it!
"
3,10,Stan,"Can you see anything? 
"
3,10,Kids,"Yay!!! 
"
3,10,Stan,"It's starting, it's starting!

3,10,Singer,"I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon!

3,10,Mr. Ose,"Attention! Attention!  This isa Chinpokomon Camp!
"
3,10,Kids,"Chinpokomon is what we strive to be great at in our hearts!
"
3,10,Kyle,"...our hearts.  Kenny? 
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"What is the Primary Main Objective?
"
3,10,Kids,"To destroy the Evil Power!
"
3,10,Kyle,"...Power.
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"Yesuh. Anda what is the Evil Power?  The Evil Power is the United States gorvernment! 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Ohhh.
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"United Statesuh government is the Evil Power! It hasa taken Japanese Americans! It hasa broken Japanese spirit! And what do Chinpoko Masters do to Evil Power?!
"
3,10,Kids,"Destroy it!
"
3,10,Kyle,"Destroy it?
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"That isa correct! Now, it isa great honor to present... your Chinpoko Leaduh! Emperor Hirohito! 
"
3,10,Emperor Hirohito,"Welcome to campu. Whoever passes it knows and honors that the greatness of Japan is in its history, and it is based on that history that we shall again rise to the dominant world powuh!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
"
3,10,Emperor Hirohito,"It is again time for the Rising Sun to sit tall in the sight! One Japan! One society! 
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"We will begin witha language anda exercise skills. Hajimete!!

3,10,Mr. Garrison,"No, goddammit, it's eighteen!!
"
3,10,Stan,"Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san.
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana. 
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"What did he say?!
"
3,10,Stan,"He said, ""Garrison-san sabuchii da naa.""
"
3,10,Class,"Soo desu nee! 
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"Damnit, this is not Japan!!

"
3,10,Mayor,"People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying...
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp.
"
3,10,Sharon,"My son hasn't made any sense in days.
"
3,10,Priest Maxi,"I tell you, Mayor, these Japanese are trying to change our American children somehow!
"
3,10,Mayor,"Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? 
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"We at the Japan Toy Company are vetty cohncerned about-a your cohncerns. That is why we make Chinpokomon camp.
"
3,10,Randy,"Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"There is nothing to worry about. We at Japan Toy Company are in awe of your large penis.
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"What?
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"You see, Japanese penis so small. 
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"So-eh small.
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"You Americans have such humungous burbous penis.
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"Well, uh-I guess that's true.
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"Oh, suh-n nice-a big penis American.
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"What can we possubruh do with such small penis? We cannot take over your city, filled witha men awith such mastodonic penis.
"
3,10,Jimbo,"Huwell, uh he's got a point there.
"
3,10,Randy,"Well, I guess that settles that.
"
3,10,Priest Maxi,"We're sorry we took your time, gentlemen.
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"Oh, no. Thank you. Another chance to be in same room with big American penis. 
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"Uh-uh, my penis so small. 
"
3,10,Priest Maxi,"Nice guys. 
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"Jikan ganai. Suberi maratsuba. Sukash. Simenu bi faamo werosii kowai samaneba. 
"
3,10,Sharon,"So, what are we going to do about our children?  Ahhh, hello-o?
"
3,10,Mayor,"O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution.
"
3,10,Liane,"You have?
"
3,10,Mayor,"Children are fickle.  All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.
"
3,10,Sharon,"Of course! That's a great idea!
"
3,10,Sheila,"But what toy?
"
3,10,Lab Tech 1,"Alright, boys, we're going to show you a couple of commercials, and you tell us which toy interests you the most. Now, watch carefully.

"
3,10,Sheila,"How?
"
3,10,Sharon,"Come on! We don't have much time! 
"
3,10,Reporter,"And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States.
"
3,10,President Clinton,"My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you.
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"Your plane will fly autopilot to Pearl Harbor! When you arrive you will drop many bombs!
"
3,10,Kids,"Hai, sachoo-san. 
"
3,10,Stan,"Nan da kore? 
"
3,10,Randy,"Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo! 
"
3,10,Stan,"What?
"
3,10,Randy,"Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!
"
3,10,Stan,"You like it?
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.
"
3,10,Liane,"Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"Whar are they doing?!
"
3,10,Mr. Ose,"It's a trick!
"
3,10,Randy,"Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker.  Isn't that cool?
"
3,10,Stan,"No.  Screw this, dude. 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Where are you going, Stan?
"
3,10,Stan,"Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. 
"
3,10,Other kids,"Yeah. Me too! Me too. 
"
3,10,President Hirohito,"Nooo!!
"
3,10,Randy,"Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.
"
3,10,Sharon,"That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool.  We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! 
"
3,10,Stan,"Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?
"
3,10,Sharon,"You bet, Stanley! 
"
3,10,Kyle,"Owatta Beikoku! 
"
3,10,Sheila,"Kyle, it's over!
"
3,10,Kyle,"But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
"
3,10,Stan,"Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore.
"
3,10,Kyle,"What?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Yeah, dude, that's way over. 
"
3,10,Kyle,"Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
"
3,10,Stan,"No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.
"
3,10,Kyle,"So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
"
3,10,Stan,"...Ye-eah.
"
3,10,Kyle,"But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 
"
3,10,Stan,"Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. 
"
3,10,Randy,"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!
"
3,10,Randy,"Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?
"
3,10,Kyle,"Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Me, too.  I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- 
"
3,10,Stan,"What the..? 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss!

Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely?  No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them.  Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19.  Come on, remember : reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food.  Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin? 
"
3,11,Marvin,"Doundobi godia dyum * *
"
3,11,Hollis,"No, Marvin, in God's language. English.
"
3,11,Marvin,"Dongdin * * mium bidu 
"
3,11,Hollis,"Where are you going? Back to your life of sin? Don't you understand that unless you find Christ, you and all your people are doomed to eternal hellfire?

3,11,Mr. Garrison,"...And so, children, that's why Hare Krishnas are totally gay.  Uh, can I help you?
"
3,11,Agent 1,"Yes. I'm Connelly, and this is Sphinx. We're with the CIA.
"
3,11,Sphinx,"We're here to speak with some of your students.  You , you , you , and you .
"
3,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
"
3,11,Kyle,"No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!
"
3,11,Connelly,"Boys, we need to talk to you about a matter of national security. Now!
"
3,11,Kenny,"(Huh?) 
"
3,11,Mr. Garrison,"I hope you give them the chair!  Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Oh, dude, this is not cool!
"
3,11,Kyle,"Relax, fatass.
"
3,11,Cartman,"No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.
"
3,11,Stan,"What??
"
3,11,Cartman,"Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!
"
3,11,"Stan, Kyle","Ow, dude! 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny! 
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Relax, boys. We just need to talk with you.
"
3,11,Stan,"* I told you, fatass.
"
3,11,Connelly,"Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space.
"
3,11,Cartman,"Whoa, cool.
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Cool? That craft appears to have enough plutonium fuel on board to blow up a large city! Do you think that's cool?!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Totally!
"
3,11,Connelly,"Alright, children, we just need to know one thing: Do you know this person? 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.
"
3,11,Stan,"Sshh!
"
3,11,Connelly,"Who?
"
3,11,Kyle,"You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Oh. We don't know him.
"
3,11,Sphinx,"We already know you know him. We have this!  Now, who is he?! 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one? 
"
3,11,Connelly,"This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures.
"
3,11,Sphinx,"But they're just kids. We can't torture them.
"
3,11,Connelly,"Look, we don't know what that craft is capable of, but the kid is going to have to land it somewhere. God only knows what sadistic backwards Third-World country could get their hands on that ship!

3,11,Singer,"Soaring so high above the world,Never thought I could be so free.I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.

"
3,11,Mayor,"Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip
"
3,11,Crowd,"Churrah! 
"
3,11,Mayor,"Look out, he's got a gun! 
"
3,11,Man 5,"Wait, it's not a gun. It's a piece of paper.
"
3,11,Mayor,"Oh.  Oh, I think he's tryin' to tell us that he wants to relocate all his species here to Australia.
"
3,11,Marvin,"* * Muogleblabla mb'g * *.
"
3,11,Mayor,"Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take all your people in. 
"
3,11,Woman,"Hello-o. 
"
3,11,Mayor,"Guess the little pecker doesn't like missionaries.
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Now, I'll ask you again. Who is the little boy that took our ship?
"
3,11,Stan,"We don't know. 
"
3,11,The Boys,"Aaaaaaaa!  Aaaaaaaa!
"
3,11,Connelly,"Who is this person!
"
3,11,Cartman,"K-kill me.
"
3,11,Connelly,"Do it again. 
"
3,11,The Boys,"Aaaaaaaa!
"
3,11,Cartman,"No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Adopted from whom?
"
3,11,Cartman,"Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.
"
3,11,Connelly,"Sally Struthers!
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Where can we find her?!
"
3,11,Connelly,"I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go.
"
3,11,Kyle,"God job, fatass!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.
"
3,11,Stan,"Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV.
"
3,11,Receptionist,"Gentlemen, Ms. Struthers can see you now. 
"
3,11,Connelly,"I'm warning you, Bill. Sally Struthers is a bit heavy. But don't say anything, because she's pretty sensitive.
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Oh, I would never say anything. I saw some show where they made fun of Sally Struthers' weight, and I thought it was totally cruel. I mean, she helps people, you know. 
"
3,11,Connelly,"Ah, Ms. Struthers.
"
3,11,Sally,"Oh ho ho ho.  Un chaka solo david. Saime no Chewbacca dakaiminbi? ho ho. 
"
3,11,Connelly,"Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia.
"
3,11,Sally,"Oh? Makarendae bi cho.  Ho ho ho.
"
3,11,Connelly,"We need information on one of the Ethiopians. You must tell us everything you know about him. 
"
3,11,Sally,"Do ba kim.
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Uh, heh-his name is Starving Marvin.
"
3,11,Sally,"Jonoba unko chocolate Yum Yum bar ancho? 
"
3,11,Connelly,"Why, yes. It is a chocolate Yum Yum bar, Ms. Struthers , and there are several more where that came from.  Of course, if you don't want to tell us about the Ethiopian boy...
"
3,11,Sally,"Mmmmo na ka!
"
3,11,Connelly,"I'm... glad we can do business.
"
3,11,Stan,"Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.
"
3,11,Cartman,"Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? 
"
3,11,Pat,"Uh, God wants you to send us money. He needs you to send us money so we can help others.
"
3,11,Cartman,"Oh, my God, this guy again. 
"
3,11,Kyle,"Why would anybody send this asshole money? 
"
3,11,Kenny,"(To pay for the pockets on his peehole) 
"
3,11,Kyle,"Yeh-hah. 
"
3,11,Boys,"Whoa! 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Oh! Aww!  Oh, weak! 
"
3,11,Kyle,"Starvin' Marvin!

3,11,Stan,"Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.
"
3,11,Marvin,"Chede gwodum * * godom.
"
3,11,Kyle,"I think he wants us to get in.
"
3,11,Stan,"Kick ass!  Wow, this thing is awesome!
"
3,11,Kyle,"Let's go somewhere. 
"
3,11,Singer,"Soaring so high above the world,Never thought I could be so free.
"
3,11,Stan,"Wow!
"
3,11,Kyle,"Yes!
"
3,11,Singer,"I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.
"
3,11,Stan,"This is great!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? 
"
3,11,Marvin,"Gmmm?
"
3,11,Stan,"Yeah, that's better.
"
3,11,Man,"Oooh. 
"
3,11,Hollis,"Hello? Howare we doing today? Look what I got for you.
"
3,11,Man,"Nn * wohg *?
"
3,11,Hollis,"No, it's not food. It's a cross.  And it has your Christian name printed on it. From now on, you are Michael. Can you say ""Michael""?  Mmmi-chael.  Oh, well. You'll get it.  Hello, brother David. Do you have any sins to confess?  Anybody? Sins to confess? Joshua?  You know, today I'm reminded of Psalm 46, line 39: ""Though the mountains shake and th-"" 
"
3,11,Connelly,"Here they are!
"
3,11,Hollis,"Who are you?
"
3,11,Connelly,"We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents!
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Hello there, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk. I think you know why we're here. 
"
3,11,Kyle,"No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
"
3,11,Marvin,"Blubedegub? 
"
3,11,Cartman,"No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.
"
3,11,Stan,"Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this? 
"
3,11,Boys,"Whooaaa! 
"
3,11,Stan,"What the hell did you hit, Cartman?! 
"
3,11,Kyle,"Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! 
"
3,11,Boys,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! 
"
3,11,Kyle,"Where are we?
"
3,11,Marvin,"Gobin gobedo * * gowog.

"
3,11,Marklar Leader,"Greetings. Welcome to Marklar.
"
3,11,Stan,"Uh, thanks.
"
3,11,Marklar Leader,"I am Marklar, leader of the Marklar.
"
3,11,Stan,"U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
"
3,11,Marklar Leader,"Marklar to you.
"
3,11,Stan,"Cool!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
"
3,11,Stan,"Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! 
"
3,11,Marklar Leader,"We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
"
3,11,Marklar Leader,"Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
"
3,11,Stan,"Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.
"
3,11,Marklar Leader,"Well, there is a lot of room on Marklar. If Marklar here wants to bring his marklar to Marklar, that would be fine. Just take our marklar back to Marklar and bring all the marklar back with you.
"
3,11,Stan,"Uuh. Thanks.
"
3,11,Marvin,"* *.
"
3,11,Connelly,"Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him? 
"
3,11,Sphinx,"We are the CIA. That ship needs to be with us! Maybe we should just take something precious of yours, huh?!  Daha!  This! This gourd-thingy, for instance. How do you like that, huh? If you ever wanna see this... little... thingy again, I suggest you contact your boy! 
"
3,11,Sphinx,"There it is! 
"
3,11,Marvin,"Muwuhbuh * * mlamleblubluh mjek.
"
3,11,Connelly,"Back away from the space craft, children!
"
3,11,Stan,"Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. 
"
3,11,Hollis,"Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ?
"
3,11,Cartman,"No, never. It's perfect.
"
3,11,Hollis,"Ooh, no. Those poor souls. We must spread the Gospel to them. 
"
3,11,Stan,"What??
"
3,11,Marvin,"*.  Mluglu dja mugm blugabeb * * *.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
"
3,11,Connelly,"You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government!
"
3,11,Kyle,"No! 
"
3,11,Marvin,"Dor dor binor hm ghm.
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Call those boys' mothers.  I'm sure they'll be very interested in the trouble their boys have been up to.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Oh, no, dude!
"
3,11,Pat,"You know, Susan, the uh-there are so many great missionaries doing work, out there in in in-in parts of Africa, and uh we're trying to get Bibles to people all over the world. And what we need, is the help of everyone out there so that we can continue these, these projects. Now, listen to this, Susan.  Wha-one of our missionaries in North Africa has made an amazing discovery. U-u-uh a new planet, in the in the galaxy Alpha Seti VI, that has intelligent life on it.
"
3,11,Susan,"Amazing.
"
3,11,Pat,"Yeah. We're not sure what these hyper-intelligent beings look like, but one thing is for sure: they've never heard of Jesus Christ.
"
3,11,Susan,"What can we do at the 600 Club to help those poor aliens?
"
3,11,Pat,"Well, what we need, Susan, is we need money to build an interstellar cruiser.  Now, this space ship will be able to travel through a wormhole and deliver the message and guh-glory of Jesus Christ to those godless aliens. S-send your money now. Amen.
"
3,11,Connelly,"I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.
"
3,11,FBI Agent,"E-excuse me, gentlemen, uh Tom Brokaw is here to see you.
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Tom Brokaw? Oh no, the press already? 
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Uh huh.  Mr. Brokaw, I presume.
"
3,11,Connelly,"Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw.
"
3,11,Kyle,"I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
"
3,11,Marvin,"* * wughum chughum * *, * *.
"
3,11,Connelly,"Alright boys. Time to get back to your quarters.
"
3,11,Stan,"Oh. 
"
3,11,Connelly,"Son of a bitch!
"
3,11,Stan,"Run for it!
"
3,11,Connelly,"Get 'em! 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!
"
3,11,Kyle,"Watch out! Here I come!
"
3,11,Kenny,"(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-)  (Oof.)
"
3,11,Kyle,"Kenny!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Forget him! He's done for! 
"
3,11,Stan,"He's not done for, he's standing right there.
"
3,11,Kenny,"(You guys, just fly away!)
"
3,11,Cartman,"No, no, he's done for. Come on! 
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Nooo!
"
3,11,Connelly,"Damnit, damnit, damnit!
"
3,11,Stan,"Alright, we made it!
"
3,11,Kyle,"Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
"
3,11,Marvin,"Gakchak ghm. 
"
3,11,Kyle,"What was that? 
"
3,11,Hollis,"This is the Missionary 600. We have you locked on ""fire: ready."" Turn back right now. 
"
3,11,Boys,"Aaaa!
"
3,11,Ethiopians,"Whoa!
"
3,11,Stan,"They're shooting at us.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.
"
3,11,Marvin,"Midik, gmanjaum * *.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Well, how'd we do it last time??
"
3,11,Stan,"Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Which button did you press, Cartman??
"
3,11,Cartman,"U-u-huh. I don't remember.
"
3,11,Kyle,"You don't remember?!
"
3,11,Stan,"You dumbass, Cartman!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. 
"
3,11,Singer,"Soaring so high above the world.
"
3,11,The Boys,"Aawwww!
"
3,11,Singer,"Never-
"
3,11,Hollis,"The ship seems to be made out of a... super-strong alloy. These lasers aren't powerful enough.
"
3,11,Pat,"Everyone, the Word of God is going around the world and all your help is so greatly appreciated. Eh-oo What we need now is an argon crystal laser.  Eh you see, an argon crystal laser can pierce thick space holes in a way that other lasers just can't. Send your money now. Uuh-I th-thank you.
"
3,11,Sally,"Onadonakami?
"
3,11,Connelly,"Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel.
"
3,11,Sally,"Chewmbacca vije dai gwo. 
"
3,11,Sphinx,"We need to use your ship to catch those boys. We will do anything for that technology.
"
3,11,Sally,"Juodo nakahobi? Ho ho ho ho. 
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Ms. Struthers, if those Ethiopians make it to another planet, who will send money to your foundation? Without Ethiopians, you have no food.
"
3,11,Sally,"Wo? Wo chaka gom??
"
3,11,Connelly,"Oh, that won't be a problem, Ms. Struthers. We have... collateral. 
"
3,11,Kenny,"(Oh my God, I get it.)
"
3,11,Sally,"Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho. 
"
3,11,Hollis,"I have the infidels in my sight. 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Holy shit!
"
3,11,Ethiopians,"Whoa!
"
3,11,Marvin,"Doye dondabuh. 
"
3,11,Crew,"Aaah.
"
3,11,Hollis,"Holy crap, they have photon torpedoes.
"
3,11,Pat,"Uhnow, our deflector shields are useless against phorton torpedoes, and we really need your support on this one, folks. Here at the 600 Club we need your money to spread the Word of Jesus, and build more advanced deflector shields for our galactic cruiser. Call now, and we'll give you this free pin. 
"
3,11,Stan,"You got 'em, Marvin.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Yeah, now finish 'em off! 
"
3,11,Computer,"Warning. Deflector shields failing.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Where did that come from??
"
3,11,Sally,"Ho ho ho ho. 
"
3,11,Connelly,"Good! Now get them in our tractor beam! 
"
3,11,Hollis,"Now we've got 'em! 
"
3,11,Sally,"Ho ho ho ho.
"
3,11,Cartman,"It's Sally Struthers!
"
3,11,Hollis,"Well, it appears they'll be going back to Ethiopia, so we can go on to the aliens.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Sorry, Marvin. We tried.
"
3,11,Cartman,"Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
"
3,11,Sally,"Wo?
"
3,11,Cartman,"Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now. 
"
3,11,Sally,"Holna chewbacca? 
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Ms. Struthers, don't forget the gift we gave you: the child in carbonite. 
"
3,11,Sally,"Dama doko nou na oh. 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. 
"
3,11,Sally,"Oh, foada! 
"
3,11,Cartman,"She bought it.
"
3,11,Stan,"Sally Struthers is saving us!
"
3,11,Pat,"Uh, now, now, stay with me on this one, folks. Uh, Sally Struthers has a Tiberian junker , which is uh the favorite ship of the Hutts, and she has trapped oureh, our our new CBC ship in an uh  poe-sitronic tractor beam.  Uh, so we're gonna need an ionic tractor disruptor. Now now, not a regular ionic di- tractor disruptor, but a negative ionic tractor disruptor to uh, help spread the Word of Jesus.  I don't have a fucking idea up here.
"
3,11,Stan,"Now's our chance!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Wait. I remember. It was the red button! 
"
3,11,Hollis,"They've opened the wormhole!
"
3,11,Kyle,"It's pulling us in! 
"
3,11,Boys,"Aaaah!
"
3,11,Kyle,"Marvin... 
"
3,11,Marklar,"Please, please, please. We are confused. You must explain one at a Marklar.
"
3,11,Hollis,"Alien friend, we are here to spread the Word of Jesus. He died for your sins.
"
3,11,Marklar,"Who? Marklar?
"
3,11,Stan,"We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.
"
3,11,Marklar,"Brought m- marklar??
"
3,11,Hollis,"What is ""marklar""?
"
3,11,Marklar,"Yyou're marklar; everyone and everything is referred to as marklar.
"
3,11,Sphinx,"Doesn't that get confusing?
"
3,11,Marklar,"Oh no. Watch this. Hey, Marklar!
"
3,11,Marklar,"Yes?
"
3,11,Marklar,"You see?
"
3,11,Kyle,"Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
"
3,11,Marklar,"Young marklar, your marklars are wise and true.
"
3,11,Hollis,"What the hell did he say?
"
3,11,Stan,"Wow! Good job, dude!
"
3,11,Kyle,"Thanks.
"
3,11,Marklar,"The marklars can stay!
"
3,11,Ethiopians,"Wooo!
"
3,11,Boys,"Alright!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Alright,
"
3,11,Marklar,"You marklars must leave.
"
3,11,Hollis,"But you will all burn forever in eternal hellfire. 
"
3,11,Marklar,"Yes, that's nice. Thank you for stopping by.
"
3,11,Stan,"Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.
"
3,11,Marvin,"Chak chak glika gm gm guchab mglup.

3,11,Stan,"Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.
"
3,11,Cartman,"Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.
"
3,11,Stan,"Dude!
"
3,11,Cartman,"What? We're not gonna come visit him.
"
3,11,Stan,"I know, but you don't tell him that!
"
3,11,Cartman,"T'heh, whatever.

3,12,DJ,"We're here live at the KOZY 102.1 Halloween Haunt at the South Park docks! Come on down! We've got a haunted house  and everyone is decorating for tomorrow night,  HALLOWEEN, when the band KoRn, that's right, KoRn, is going to play live! And don't forget to wear a costume tomorrow, because there's a big first prize! Why, here's some kids enjoying the Halloween Haunt now!  Say boys, what do you think of KOZY-FM's Halloween Haunt so far? 
"
3,12,Stan,"This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. 
"
3,12,DJ,"Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is?
"
3,12,Kyle,"Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.
"
3,12,Cartman,"That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—
"
3,12,Stan,"Christmas?
"
3,12,Cartman,"—Christmastime is presents for me.
"
3,12,Jimbo,"Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house.
"
3,12,Guests in line,"Awwww! 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Eeyyy , Spooky Laboratory, you guys. 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory!  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...
"
3,12,Guide,"Welcome to Spooky Laboratory.  I'm your guide, Dr. Spookalot. Allow me to show around the lab. 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Cool!
"
3,12,Dr. Spookalot,"Here I have a bowl of human eyeballs.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Ewww-hoohooo.
"
3,12,Dr. Spookalot,"And here you can feel the brains.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Oh-HO, grohoss.
"
3,12,Dr. Spookalot,"And here you can feel the warm innards of the body 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!
"
3,12,Kenny,"(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)
"
3,12,Kyle,"Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. 
"
3,12,Boy in Green Shirt,"BOO!
"
3,12,"Stan, Kyle, Kenny","Aaaaah! 
"
3,12,Boy in Green Shirt,"Ha ha ha ha ha! We scared you, chickens!
"
3,12,Stan,"W-we weren't scared!
"
3,12,Boy in Green Shirt,"Oh no? Well, you should be!  The pirate ghosts are gonna come getcha!
"
3,12,Kyle,"The what?
"
3,12,Boy in Green Shirt,"Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Nuh-uh.
"
3,12,Boy in Green Shirt,"Yuh-huh. They roam these docks with their swords and hook-hands  looking for victims tuh...  cut up!
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Hoh!)
"
3,12,Stan,"That's just an old legend.
"
3,12,Pirate Ghost cutout,"Rar!
"
3,12,"Stan, Kyle, Kenny","Aaaaah! 
"
3,12,Boy in Green Shirt,"Ha ha ha ha, gotcha again, heh ha ha!  Just wait till tomorrow! We're gonna scare you kids to death! Ha ha ha haa! 
"
3,12,Cartman,"You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it. 
"
3,12,Stan,"I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
"
3,12,Kyle,"Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
"
3,12,DJ,"Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks?
"
3,12,Priest Maxi,"Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh!
"
3,12,DJ,"Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh?
"
3,12,Priest Maxi,"KoRn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil!
"
3,12,DJ,"Alriight, we'll see you tomorrow for Halloween! In the meantime  here's a KOZY hit by Barry Manilow.
"
3,12,Stan,"Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.
"
3,12,Cartman,"We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.
"
3,12,Kyle,"That's not scary, fatass!
"
3,12,Stan,"Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! 
"
3,12,Pirate Ghosts,"Darrrr!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Are you sure we're goin' the right way?
"
3,12,David,"I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense.
"
3,12,Head,"That's because you've got it upside down, chowderhead! 
"
3,12,David,"Oops.
"
3,12,Fieldy,"When are we gonna get to the gig? I'm starving.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Don't think about it. We'll just keep playing our game. Ready? I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter T!
"
3,12,Munky,"I know! A t-ree!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"You've got it. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter R.
"
3,12,David,"A road?
"
3,12,Jonathan,"That's it! 
"
3,12,Pirates,"Darrrr!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Okay, here's one. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter P.
"
3,12,Head,"The letter P?
"
3,12,Fieldy,"What the heck starts with the letter P?
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Puh-pirate ghosts! 
"
3,12,All,"Aaaaah! 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay , let's see.  I waant... thiis... aand... this...  and...  let's see, comes with so...  ...comes with two bars , so there we go, have that...  and, let's see...
"
3,12,Liane,"Eric, your little friends are here.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?
"
3,12,Liane,"E-heric, it's only Halloween.
"
3,12,Cartman,"That's only 72 shopping days left for you!
"
3,12,Stan,"Come on, fatass, we have to go!
"
3,12,Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.
"
3,12,Liane,"I'm sorry, hon,
"
3,12,Cartman,"I can't go with you guys right now.
"
3,12,Stan,"Yes you can, porky. 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Mom, seriously! 
"
3,12,Liane,"Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.
"
3,12,Kyle,"He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
"
3,12,Cartman,"God-damnit, mom!
"
3,12,Cartman,"God, I hate you guys!
"
3,12,Stan,"Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
"
3,12,Cartman,"How?
"
3,12,Stan,"What's the scariest thing we could get?
"
3,12,Cartman,"Spooky spider?
"
3,12,Stan,"No!  A dead body.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, a dead body.
"
3,12,Cartman,"You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?
"
3,12,Stan,"We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
"
3,12,Cartman,"So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
"
3,12,Stan,"We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
"
3,12,Stan,"Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?
"
3,12,Kyle,"Are you insane?!
"
3,12,Cartman,"U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
3,12,Kyle,"Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
"
3,12,Stan,"All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
"
3,12,Kyle,"Naww, let's dig up somebody else.
"
3,12,Stan,"Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
"
3,12,Cartman,"This is gonna be fun!
"
3,12,Cartman,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.
"
3,12,Stan,"Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!
"
3,12,Kyle,"This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma. 
"
3,12,Stan,"Well, let's dig 'er up! 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
"
3,12,Stan,"Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
"
3,12,Kyle,"I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
"
3,12,Cartman,"""Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!""  Ow.
"
3,12,Stan,"You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!
"
3,12,Kyle,"I don't really care, dude.
"
3,12,Stan,"Yes you do! Now, dig! 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, ""You-hoo""...
"
3,12,Stan,"Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.
"
3,12,A voice,"Hi, Kyle.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Aaaah!
"
3,12,Cartman,"Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?
"
3,12,Kyle,"Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!
"
3,12,Stan,"Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Heh heh, I'm sweet.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
"
3,12,Stan,"Okay, grab the sled. 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...
"
3,12,Stan,"Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.
"
3,12,Kyle,"How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
"
3,12,Cartman,"We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: ""Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!""
"
3,12,Kyle,"Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
"
3,12,Male voice,"O-o-o-o-oh. 
"
3,12,Stan,"Who was that?
"
3,12,Kyle,"Cartman?!
"
3,12,Cartman,"It wasn't me! 
"
3,12,Male voice,"Who-o-oa.
"
3,12,Stan,"Dude, not cool. This is scary. 
"
3,12,The Boys,"Wa-a-a-ah!
"
3,12,Munky,"Hey! Like, it's just some kids.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Oh, fwooh, I was really scared there, for a second.
"
3,12,Stan,"Hay, you're that band KoRn.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Yeah. I'm Jonathan , and this is Munky , David , Fieldy , and Head . And over there is our pal, Nibblet.  Hey, where'd Nibblet go?
"
3,12,Nibblet,"Uh-huh, Nibblet likes potato chips.
"
3,12,KoRn,"Nibblet!
"
3,12,Nibblet,"Okay.
"
3,12,Stan,"What are you guys doing out here?
"
3,12,Head,"We were just driving our van when all of a sudden we were run off the road by some super-spooky pirate ghosts.
"
3,12,Stan,"Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
"
3,12,Stan,"Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is?
"
3,12,Stan,"Yeah, dude. It's right over there.
"
3,12,KoRn,"O-kay! 
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow.
"
3,12,Priest Maxi,"I know who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloween is an abomination!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Groovy! Could you show us where to set up?
"
3,12,Stan,"Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
"
3,12,Stan,"Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
"
3,12,Cartman,"Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?) 
"
3,12,Sheila,"Hold on, kids. 
"
3,12,Brunet,"Mrs. Broflovski?
"
3,12,Sheila,"Yes?
"
3,12,Brunet,"We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you?
"
3,12,Sheila,"Eehh, sure, come in.  What is it?
"
3,12,Brunet,"Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave.
"
3,12,Sheila,"Defiled? How?
"
3,12,Blond,"Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up.
"
3,12,Sheila,"Dug her up? Why??
"
3,12,Brunet,"Well. The- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.
"
3,12,Blond,"Yeahp.
"
3,12,Sheila,"What?!
"
3,12,Brunet,"Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak.
"
3,12,Blond,"Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable.
"
3,12,Sheila,"Hoh, dear God!
"
3,12,Brunet,"Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.
"
3,12,Sheila,"Oooh.
"
3,12,Blond,"No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it.
"
3,12,Sheila,"O-o-o-o-oh!
"
3,12,Brunet,"Yes. And, now for the difficult part.
"
3,12,Blond,"Brace yourself.
"
3,12,Brunet,"It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like — an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-
"
3,12,Sheila,"Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!
"
3,12,Brunet,"...Do?
"
3,12,Blond,"Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen.
"
3,12,Brunet,"Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something.
"
3,12,Sheila,"O-o-ogh! 
"
3,12,Brunet,"Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition. 
"
3,12,Delivery Man,"Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?
"
3,12,Cartman,"A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!
"
3,12,Delivery Man,"Sign heah, and heah, and heah. 
"
3,12,Cartman,"I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present!  ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  Let's see here.  That's good, I'll rewrap it later!  Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia.  Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got! 
"
3,12,DJ,"It's Halloween day, so come on down to the docks and bring your costumes! 
"
3,12,Stan,"Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
"
3,12,Stan,"Where's your costume, fatass?
"
3,12,Cartman,"Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like ""Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!"" 
"
3,12,Stan,"Hey, Kenny.
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)
"
3,12,Cartman,"U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!
"
3,12,Stan,"Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet
"
3,12,Cartman,"Uuh, problem, guys.
"
3,12,Stan,"What's the problem?
"
3,12,Cartman,"Nno Grandma.
"
3,12,Kyle,"No Grandma??
"
3,12,Cartman,"Nno Grandma.
"
3,12,Kyle,"She's not here!
"
3,12,Stan,"She has to be here! 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
"
3,12,Barbrady,"Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen? 
"
3,12,Brunet,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like. 
"
3,12,Crowd,"Ee-oooh!
"
3,12,Brunet,"Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like. 
"
3,12,Crowd,"Awwwgh! 
"
3,12,Man,"Excuse me, how is this helping?
"
3,12,Barbrady,"That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.
"
3,12,Pirate voice,"Noo! Don't go to the docks!  Aarrrgh!  Argh, I'm Captain Bly! You land-lubbers had better stay away from the docks! Or else, there'll be hell to pay!  Fire the cannon!  Har harharharhar! 
"
3,12,Pirate Ghost 2,"Arrrgh! 
"
3,12,Captain Bly,"We won't warn ya again! Stay away from our docks! 
"
3,12,Priest Maxi,"I warned you! I told you this would happen!  When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Halloween concerts, this is what you get!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts.
"
3,12,DJ,"Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Cancelled?
"
3,12,DJ,"You best clear out of here! There's pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you. 
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up.
"
3,12,The Others,"Awww. 
"
3,12,Kyle,"God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
"
3,12,Munky,"Oh, hey! The kids from last night.
"
3,12,Head,"Wow! Is that the Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll? 
"
3,12,David,"Hey, Kenny.
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Aw, man!) 
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Somebody took my dead grandma.
"
3,12,Fieldy,"What?
"
3,12,Stan,"We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 
"
3,12,Fieldy,"Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts.
"
3,12,David,"They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Huh?
"
3,12,David,"""Pirate ghost"" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate.
"
3,12,Munky,"No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts, because they're the ghosts of pirates.
"
3,12,Fieldy,"You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"But that makes them pirate ghosts.
"
3,12,David,"No. It makes them ghost pirates.
"
3,12,Munky,"Pirate ghosts!
"
3,12,Head,"Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Pirate ghosts.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Then, you'll help us?
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing we like more than playing music, it's solvin' a groovy mystery.
"
3,12,The Boys,"Al-right!
"
3,12,Chef,"Is everybody okay?
"
3,12,Sheila,"People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?
"
3,12,Gerald,"I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.
"
3,12,Mr. Garrison,"He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.
"
3,12,Sharon,"Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!
"
3,12,Crowd,"Yeah! 
"
3,12,Randy,"Lynch mob! 
"
3,12,Man,"Down with KoRn!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"So this is where you last saw your dead grandma.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Right. 
"
3,12,Stan,"Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues.
"
3,12,Stan,"How should we split up?
"
3,12,Jonathan,"I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way,  and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way. 
"
3,12,KoRn,"O-kay! 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Wow! That was easy.
"
3,12,Randy,"Here's their van! Here's their van!
"
3,12,Woman,"Let's flip it over!
"
3,12,Some Folks,"Yeah!
"
3,12,Barbrady,"Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top. 
"
3,12,Man,"Devil worshipers! 
"
3,12,Crowd,"Yeah!
"
3,12,Man 2,"Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!
"
3,12,Stan,"This place gives me the creeps.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Say, this looks like a clue.  ""Pirate Lore of South Park."" Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates? 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Whoa. What was that?
"
3,12,Jonathan,"The noise came from in here. Stay close, everybody! 
"
3,12,Fieldy,"Oh, no! I lost my glasses.
"
3,12,Head,"What does this dead grandma look like?
"
3,12,Cartman,"Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.
"
3,12,David,"Hey, I got an idea.  We should set a groovy trap.
"
3,12,Munky,"Good idea.
"
3,12,Cartman,"How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
"
3,12,David,"We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!
"
3,12,Munky,"Come on, kid. We all have to do our part, even Antonio.
"
3,12,Fieldy,"My glasses gotta be around here somewhere.  Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I'm glad to see you. I lost my glasses.
"
3,12,Peg-leg,"Raaarrrgh!
"
3,12,Fieldy,"Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan?
"
3,12,Peg-leg,"Raarraarrgh! 
"
3,12,Fieldy,"Yeah, that sounds like a groovy song, man! Remember that one! 
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Fieldy, what are you doing?!
"
3,12,Fieldy,"Oh, I was talking to you, Jonathan. ...Hey, wait a minute. If you're over there, then how could you be over here? Unless you're actually a...
"
3,12,All,"Puh-puuhh pirate ghost! 
"
3,12,Peg-leg,"Raaarrrgh!
"
3,12,David,"Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas.  When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Wow, cool!
"
3,12,Munky,"Hey! Somebody's coming. 
"
3,12,Secure Group,"Aaaaah!
"
3,12,Stan,"We've got to hide!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Hey, there's Antonio Banderas! He'll help us.  Mr. Banderas!
"
3,12,David,"Jonathan, no!
"
3,12,Secure group,"Aaaah! 
"
3,12,Head,"Oh, no!
"
3,12,Secure group,"Aaaah! 
"
3,12,Stan,"Ow!
"
3,12,David,"Hold on, guys! 
"
3,12,Brunet,"Alright, KoRn, time for you to get out of town! 
"
3,12,Pirate Ghosts,"Aarrrrgh.
"
3,12,Crowd,"Aaaaaah!
"
3,12,Randy,"KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
"
3,12,Crowd,"Aaaaaah!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Alright, gang. Looks like we're gonna have to use our special KoRn powers.  KoRn powers, vitalize! 
"
3,12,Munky,"Munky!
"
3,12,David,"David!
"
3,12,Fieldy,"Fieldy!
"
3,12,Head,"Head!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Jonathan!
"
3,12,KoRn,"Form of... CORN! 
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Alright! Great job, gang! 
"
3,12,Cartman,"That didn't help at all.
"
3,12,Head,"We know. It's just cool to do.
"
3,12,Pirate Ghosts,"Aarrrrgh!
"
3,12,Nibblet,"Nibblet! 
"
3,12,KoRn,"Nibblet!
"
3,12,Barbrady,"What the hell is that thing??
"
3,12,David,"You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Yeah. And now let's see who these pirate ghosts really are!  Oh, I guess they really were pirate ghosts.
"
3,12,Barbrady,"Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!
"
3,12,Nibblet,"Hehey, look what Nibblet sees. 
"
3,12,Priest Maxi,"Whoa! 
"
3,12,Chef,"What the...?
"
3,12,Man,"Father Maxi?
"
3,12,Priest Maxi,"Well, what are you waiting for, Barbrady?! Arrest that band!
"
3,12,Barbrady,"Oh?
"
3,12,Jonathan,"No! Arrest him!
"
3,12,Mob,"Huh??
"
3,12,Jonathan,"I think I've got this groovy mystery solved!
"
3,12,Chef,"Well, I must say I still don't get this at all.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks.
"
3,12,David,"Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts. 
"
3,12,Fieldy,"Then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese.  Aaaaraargh!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels. 
"
3,12,Chef,"Father, why did you go to all this trouble?
"
3,12,Priest Maxi,"Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!
"
3,12,Chef,"Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?
"
3,12,Brunet,"Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody?
"
3,12,Priest Maxi,"No.
"
3,12,Barbrady,"Okay buddy, you can explain downtown! 
"
3,12,Sheila,"Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!
"
3,12,Kyle,"Yeah! Where's Grandma? 
"
3,12,Mob,"Eeewww! 
"
3,12,Stan,"There she is!
"
3,12,Mob,"Oooh!
"
3,12,Man,"Ho-hoh.
"
3,12,Chef,"Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!
"
3,12,Sharon,"Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Well, sure. Why the heck not?
"
3,12,Mob,"All right! 
"
3,12,Pirate Voice,"Raarrrr!
"
3,12,Stan,"Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back! 
"
3,12,All,"Nibblet!
"
3,12,Nibblet,"Uh oh!
"
3,12,Jonathan,"Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive.
"
3,12,All,"Yeah.
"
3,12,Jonathan,"The gang and I wrote a song about it, and it goes goes a little somethin' like this:And a-one, and-a-two, and a 
"
3,12,Stan,"Boo!
"
3,12,Fifth Graders,"Aaaah! 
"
3,12,"Stan, Kyle","Sweet! 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Antonio, no!  You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! 
"
3,12,Mr. Garrison,"And the winner of the costume contest is  Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! Come on up, Wendy. 
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Awww.)
"
3,12,Kenny,"(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!) 
"
3,13,Liane,"Eric, Mommy got you a present!
"
3,13,Cartman,"A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!
"
3,13,Liane,"Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do.

3,13,Cartman,"What the hell is ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics?""

"
3,13,Jimbo,"Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks.
"
3,13,Gerald,"You bet money on my son to win?!

"
3,13,Cartman,"Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! 
"
3,13,Mayor,"And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds! 
"
3,13,Jimbo,"What?! 
"
3,13,Cartman,"Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
"
3,13,Jimbo,"Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!
"
3,13,Kyle,"What's a ""home-schooled kid""?
"
3,13,Stan,"I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. 
"
3,13,The Cotswolds,"Go, Mark! Go, Rebecca!
"
3,13,Mayor,"Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school.  All right, Mark. Your word is ""conscientious.""
"
3,13,Cartman,"What?! What the fuck that that mean?
"
3,13,Mark,"""Conscientious."" May I have the definition, please?
"
3,13,Mayor,"Closely attentive to details. Careful.
"
3,13,Mark,"""Conscientious."" Could you use it in a sentence, please?
"
3,13,Mayor,"Mary's analysis of the spreadsheet was... conscientious.
"
3,13,Mark,"""Conscientious."" C O N S C I E N T I O U S.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Holy crap! 
"
3,13,The Cotswolds,"Way to go, Mark! Alright!
"
3,13,Mayor,"Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman.  Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr.

"
3,13,Rebecca,"""Litoral."" Deh-finition?
"
3,13,Mayor,"Having to do with a lake or ocean.
"
3,13,Rebecca,"""Litoral."" Will you please use it in a sentence?

3,13,Mayor,"Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.
"
3,13,Rebecca,"""Littoral.""  L I T O R A L
"
3,13,Mayor,"Correct!
"
3,13,Kyle,"Wow! 
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Alright, Rebecca. Good job, honey. 
"
3,13,Mayor,"Now we have Kyle Broflovski.  Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.

3,13,Kyle,"What??
"
3,13,Mayor,"Krocsyldiphithic.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Definition?

"
3,13,Kyle,"""Krocsyldiphic."" C  Damnit!

3,13,Jimbo,"You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks.  Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!
"
3,13,Mayor,"Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca.  You are truly South Park's finest. 
"
3,13,Stan,"Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth. 
"
3,13,Kyle,"What's your name? 
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Guh what's in a name? 
"
3,13,Kyle,"Wooww.
"
3,13,Mark,"It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Oh, yes. We must do it again.
"
3,13,Stan,"We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
"
3,13,Mark,"No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life.
"
3,13,Cartman,"How come you don't go to school?
"
3,13,Mark,"Because I'm home-schooled.
"
3,13,Stan,"What's that?
"
3,13,Mark,"My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
"
3,13,Cartman,"You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
"
3,13,Mark,"Right.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?
"
3,13,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman?
"
3,13,Cartman,"You shut up,  butthole.
"
3,13,Stan,"You shut up,  gaywad!
"
3,13,Cartman,"You shut up,  ass-logger!
"
3,13,Mark,"Oh my goodness, are you two enemies?
"
3,13,Stan,"No, we're friends.
"
3,13,Mark,"Strange, friends would call each other names and fight.
"
3,13,Stan,"What?
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Come, children, let's take our trophies home and place them high up on the mantel. 
"
3,13,Stan,"Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos.
"
3,13,Mark,"Papa?
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Yes, Mark?
"
3,13,Mark,"Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"Oooh.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Well, because, son, public schools are inefficient and dangerous!
"
3,13,Mark,"But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá.
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"Mark, you have play time. You get to play in the afternoon.
"
3,13,Mark,"I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it.
"
3,13,Mark,"Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is!
"
3,13,Mark,"Hooray!
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca?
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Oh, heavens, no.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe! 
"
3,13,Kyle,"Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"Yes she is. 
"
3,13,Kyle,"...Uuh, can I talk to her?
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"Oh. Well, I suppose so. Rebecca!  This little boy wants to see you.
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Huhlo? 
"
3,13,Kyle,"U-u-uh, hi. 
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Hel-lo.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Who was that?
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"A little boy wanted to see Rebecca.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea.
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"But the children won, and they were happy to meet the other children.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close! 
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Hokay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark? 
"
3,13,Mark,"Hey, guys. What's up?
"
3,13,Cartman,"Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America?  Ehyes, Mark?
"
3,13,Cartman,"Ey! How come you never pick me?!
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?
"
3,13,Mark,"The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards. 
"
3,13,Stan,"Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from?  Put your hand down, creampuff.
"
3,13,Cartman,"That does it!  I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
"
3,13,Stan,"You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.
"
3,13,Cartman,"I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! 
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, please God, let it be forever.
"
3,13,Stan,"Come on, Pip, say it. Say ""Please, hit me.""
"
3,13,Pip,"But, if I say that, you'll hit me.
"
3,13,Stan,"No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say ""Please, hit me,"" I won't hit you.
"
3,13,Pip,"Please, hit me.
"
3,13,Stan,"All right. 
"
3,13,Pip,"Ooowww!
"
3,13,Stan,"Alright, we'll try this again, Pip.
"
3,13,Mark,"I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time. 
"
3,13,Craig,"Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball.
"
3,13,Mark,"Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.
"
3,13,Stan,"Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. 
"
3,13,Butters,"Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
"
3,13,Mark,"You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
"
3,13,Craig,"Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!
"
3,13,Boys,"Okay, let's get him... 
"
3,13,Butters,"Got it. 
"
3,13,Craig,"Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!
"
3,13,Butters,"Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
"
3,13,Mark,"Oh, dear.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now.
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"I'm sure he's alright.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"That must be him. 
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"Waaaaah! 
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Oh my God, son!
"
3,13,Mark,"Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. 
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Mark, what have they done to you?!
"
3,13,Mark,"Well, they duct-taped me to a bench.
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"But why?
"
3,13,Mark,"I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools!
"
3,13,Mark,"But I want to go back tomorrow, papá.
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"What??
"
3,13,Mark,"Please, just give me one more day. 
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"What do we do?
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers. 
"
3,13,A voice,"Everywhere I go, I'm thinking of you, Rebecca.I don't know what to do, Rebecca.You're so nice, I'd like to get to know you better.So what do you say we get together?You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!Rebecca, you're really quite good-looking!You're a fox.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments.  My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy. 
"
3,13,Randy,"Uh, look, Mr....
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Cotswolds.
"
3,13,Randy,"Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better.  And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop.
"
3,13,Gerald,"Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?
"
3,13,Randy,"Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!
"
3,13,Jimbo,"Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers.
"
3,13,Jimbo,"You what??
"
3,13,Jimbo,"See ya, Cotswolds.  Thanks for stopping by.
"
3,13,Gerald,"Yeah. See ya. 
"
3,13,Kyle,"...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
"
3,13,Mark,"Can I sit here with you?
"
3,13,Stan,"Aw, man, if you have to.
"
3,13,Principal Victoria,"Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
"
3,13,Stan,"Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. 
"
3,13,Kenny,"(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)
"
3,13,Mark,"Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
"
3,13,Stan,"Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.
"
3,13,Mark,"I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.
"
3,13,Kyle,"What??
"
3,13,Craig,"Enjoying your lunch, nerdo?
"
3,13,Mark,"Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me.
"
3,13,Stan,"Ah, dude, you don't say that.
"
3,13,Mark,"Huh?
"
3,13,Craig,"Get him! 
"
3,13,Kyle,"Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
"
3,13,Stan,"Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Eeehhh.
"
3,13,Announcer,"Welcome to Huntin' and Killin' with Jimbo and Ned.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Eehh, shut up.  Ooohhh, yeasss.
"
3,13,Liane,"Hon, are you ready for some math problems?
"
3,13,Cartman,"Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door.
"
3,13,Liane,"Oh, all right. 
"
3,13,Cartman,"Mom?
"
3,13,Liane,"Yes?
"
3,13,Cartman,"Could you turn up the heat just a little?
"
3,13,Liane,"Sure, hon. 
"
3,13,Cartman,"Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules.  Yeeehhhhhhss! 
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Oh, hel-lo.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
"
3,13,Rebecca,"He-ey, would you like to come up to my room?
"
3,13,Kyle,"Huh?
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Woowould you like to come up to my room?
"
3,13,Kyle,"Uuuh, okay.  Gah!
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school.
"
3,13,Mark,"Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise.
"
3,13,Mark,"Alright. 
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Mark, where's your sister?
"
3,13,Mark,"She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Oh, alright.
"
3,13,Both parents,"What?! 
"
3,13,Mrs. Cotswolds,"Rebecca! Aaah! Aaaaah! Noo-hooo!
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Rebecca, don't play that perverted game! 
"
3,13,Rebecca,"I have to extricate a rr-region in his cerebral cortex, or risk ih-nfection to the synaptic responses.
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling! 
"
3,13,Kyle,"Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Hhm. Alright, I guess I'll go.
"
3,13,Kyle,"You will?
"
3,13,Rebecca,"I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there.
"
3,13,Kyle,"No no. I mean, go with me.
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Oh, I'm sure Father will give me a ride. 
"
3,13,Cartman,"Ahhhhhhhhh.  Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired.
"
3,13,Liane,"Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom. 
"
3,13,Liane,"Eric, please. We have to do some studying today.
"
3,13,Cartman,"I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. 
"
3,13,Stan,"Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?
"
3,13,Cartman,"Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys.
"
3,13,Stan,"Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!
"
3,13,Cartman,"Huh, I can't. I'm too tired.  Maybe tomorrow.
"
3,13,Kenny,"(Hey, can I have that?)  (Heey.)
"
3,13,Stan,"But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
"
3,13,Cartman,"That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
"
3,13,Kenny,"(Hey!)  (Hey, Cartman, help me.)
"
3,13,Cartman,"No, Fonics Monkey!  No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! 
"
3,13,Stan,"Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!
"
3,13,Cartman,"You're damn straight, he did.
"
3,13,Kyle,"You got my note?
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I not see it?
"
3,13,Kyle,"Uh, can we sit down?
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Wha-y noh-ot?  Isn't Papa's garden beautiful? He works so hard on it. 
"
3,13,Kyle,"Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?
"
3,13,Rebecca,"I...  have looked at it.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.
"
3,13,Rebecca,"How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?
"
3,13,Kyle,"From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Well, what else would one do?
"
3,13,Kyle,"Love, for one thing.
"
3,13,Rebecca,"And woowhat is love?
"
3,13,Kyle,"Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Woowhat means ""ki-iss""?
"
3,13,Kyle,"When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
"
3,13,Rebecca,"You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss.  So I cold write about it.  How do we do it?
"
3,13,Kyle,"I'm not completely sure.
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Should we...  l-look it up?
"
3,13,Kyle,"No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Wow. Wow, that was fun! 
"
3,13,Kyle,"Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Y-you bet your sweet a-ass I will.
"
3,13,Craig,"Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole.
"
3,13,Stan,"Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
"
3,13,Craig,"That's the point, buttpipe.
"
3,13,Stan,"Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!
"
3,13,Butters,"Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.
"
3,13,Boys,"Hooray! 
"
3,13,Bill,"Hooray. 
"
3,13,Jimbo,"Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow. 
"
3,13,Randy,"Uhwhy do we want to all chaperone the dance?
"
3,13,Jimbo,"Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!
"
3,13,Gerald,"The flagpole! That's great! 
"
3,13,Jimbo,"Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
"
3,13,Men,"Alright!
"
3,13,Stan,"Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? 
"
3,13,Kyle,"I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
"
3,13,Stan,"Oh, brother! 
"
3,13,Kyle,"Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
"
3,13,Stan,"You suck now, Kyle! 
"
3,13,Kyle,"You suck!
"
3,13,Principal Victoria,"Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio! 
"
3,13,Dio,"Are you ready to rock, boys and girls?!  I said, are you ready to rock?!
"
3,13,Butters,"Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess.
"
3,13,Dio,"Then let's hit it!  I know you all remember this one. It's off my first solo album. The song that you all helped me make number 1.Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea.Oh, what's-
"
3,13,Craig,"Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid!  Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! 
"
3,13,Butters,"Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister? 
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Hi, guys. 
"
3,13,Butters,"Woo-oh Holy Cow! 
"
3,13,Rebecca,"He-ey, baby. Come s-see me later, 'kay? 
"
3,13,Token,"What the-? Damn, baby. 
"
3,13,Rebecca,"Hey, Kyle. Wanna go make out?
"
3,13,Kyle,"Rebecca. You...
"
3,13,Mark,"Rebecca, what the devil are you doing? 
"
3,13,Rebecca,"I'm... having... fun, Mark. 
"
3,13,Pip,"Oh, my goodness! 
"
3,13,Mark,"You're out of control.  You did this to my sister!
"
3,13,Kyle,"Uh. All I did was show her how to-
"
3,13,Mark,"You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! 
"
3,13,Kyle,"Aaaah!
"
3,13,Mark,"You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! 
"
3,13,Kyle,"Ooww!
"
3,13,Craig,"Oh my God!
"
3,13,Stan,"Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
"
3,13,Butters,"Yeah. He's a badass! 
"
3,13,Randy,"Alright, alright, that's enough, boys. 
"
3,13,Mark,"...I'm not through with you, bitch! 
"
3,13,Stan,"Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark. 
"
3,13,Butters,"Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.
"
3,13,Stan,"Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? 
"
3,13,Craig,"No! He's my friend!
"
3,13,Butters,"Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! 
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"They've got to be here somewhere.
"
3,13,Jimbo,"Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!
"
3,13,Men,"Yeah! 
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!
"
3,13,Mark,"Calm down, papá!  Everything is all right.  You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on.  Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. 
"
3,13,Butters,"Well, she sure is.
"
3,13,Mark,"I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. 
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"Mark. You're absolutely right.  Okay, children. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school.
"
3,13,Kids,"Alright! 
"
3,13,Stan,"Nice speech, nerdo.
"
3,13,Mark,"Thanks, gaywad. 
"
3,13,Cartman,"Now you're gettin' it.
"
3,13,Jimbo,"Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!
"
3,13,Men,"Hooray!
"
3,13,Mr. Cotswolds,"What?! 
"
3,13,Mark,"See ya, papá! 
"
3,13,Dio,"Well, I'm glad we all learned something today, kids. Now, let's dance! 
"
3,14,Stan,"Ready? 1-2-3-4. 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
3,14,Cartman,"I'm playing the drum.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Well, you have to hit it softer!
"
3,14,Cartman,"You can't just ""hit"" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!!  That's how you rock, dude.
"
3,14,Kyle,"You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
"
3,14,Cartman,"I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
"
3,14,Stan,"That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Ey, I'll get it!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yes I will!
"
3,14,Stan,"Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Cartman!!! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"What?
"
3,14,Kyle,"Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
"
3,14,Cartman,"No way! Flutes are totally gay!
"
3,14,Kenny,"(Oh. Flutes are gay?)
"
3,14,Stan,"Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
3,14,Kyle,"You dick!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Later.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield.  First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!
"
3,14,Men,"Yes! Woohoo, yea!
"
3,14,Stan,"Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 
"
3,14,Kyle,"He'll show.
"
3,14,Stan,"He'd better!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.
"
3,14,Men,"Whoa. Mmm.
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.
"
3,14,Stuart,"Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?
"
3,14,Stan,"Dude, that's not cool.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Good morning, gentlemen.
"
3,14,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
"
3,14,Stan,"You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
"
3,14,Grandpa,"Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead.
"
3,14,Kyle,"The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.
"
3,14,Kyle,"No they're not, stupid!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yes we are!
"
3,14,Kyle,"How much do you wanna bet?!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. 
"
3,14,Kyle,"Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
"
3,14,Kyle,"And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
"
3,14,Cartman,"Right.
"
3,14,Kyle,"You're on!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. 
"
3,14,Stan,"Hoohoo what a dumbass!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
"
3,14,Stan,"It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!
"
3,14,Men,"Yes! Woohoo, yea!
"
3,14,Announcer,"Welcome to the South Park reenactment of the Battle of Tamarack Hill. The men in gray are the Confederacy, from the South ; in blue are the Union, from the North .
"
3,14,Grandpa,"It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appomattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle. 
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Forward! 
"
3,14,Randy,"Let's bring those Confederate bastards down! 
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Fire! 
"
3,14,Confederate Reenactors,"Yeah!
"
3,14,Randy,"Alright men, fire! 
"
3,14,Union Reenactors,"Yeah! 
"
3,14,Randy,"Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.
"
3,14,Ned,"Ow.
"
3,14,Randy,"Yeh-hah! 
"
3,14,Man 1,"Oh, so this is what it was like. 
"
3,14,Man 2,"Hey! What's that guy doing?!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
"
3,14,Reenactors,"Huh? Wha-?
"
3,14,Grandpa,"What the hell?
"
3,14,Randy,"He took the bell!
"
3,14,Gerald,"He can't do that!
"
3,14,Grandpa,"The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Hooray for the South!
"
3,14,Stan,"Cartman, you can't do that!
"
3,14,Grandpa,"God damnit! Now we have to start over!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.
"
3,14,Cartman,"But why? Why should they get the bell?
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose.
"
3,14,Cartman,"But we don't have to lose.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"What??
"
3,14,Cartman,"Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"" 
"
3,14,Jimbo,"By God, he's right!
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"Jimbo!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
"
3,14,Stuart,"I'm tired of losing this battle!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
"
3,14,Reenactors,"Yeah!
"
3,14,Reenactor,"Yeah! 
"
3,14,Grandpa,"Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to- 
"
3,14,Confederate 1,"Yaaaaah!
"
3,14,Confederate 2,"Come on! Just give up! We're not gonna let you live another day!
"
3,14,Gerald,"Uh, what are they doing?
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"You Yankee sons of bitches!
"
3,14,Randy,"Ow! That hurt!
"
3,14,Grandpa,"God damnit, what the hell are they doing?!
"
3,14,Kyle,"What do we do?!
"
3,14,Stan,"Run for your life, dude! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
"
3,14,Reenactor,"Come on!
"
3,14,Randy,"Oh?
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Surrender your men, general!
"
3,14,Randy,"Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!
"
3,14,Randy,"Alright, alright. We surrender. 
"
3,14,Barbrady,"The South win?
"
3,14,Jimbo,"The South wins!
"
3,14,Reenactors,"Yeah, woohoo!
"
3,14,Grandpa,"God damnit!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Well, we can all be friends now.  Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. 
"
3,14,Randy,"Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Aw, come on. Have a little sip. 
"
3,14,Cartman,"So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
"
3,14,Kyle,"You cheated, Cartman!
"
3,14,Stan,"Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
"
3,14,Cartman,"I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. 
"
3,14,Randy,"All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too!
"
3,14,Bartender,"Yeah.
"
3,14,Reenactor,"Yeah.
"
3,14,Gerald,"You're dreaming!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Perhaps we should take Topeka.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Huh?
"
3,14,Cartman,"They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"They don't?!
"
3,14,Cartman,"No. I say we take Topeka.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
"
3,14,Randy,"Huh?
"
3,14,Stuart,"That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"I'll bet we could!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"I'll bet we could, too! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"I'll bet you can't.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"What?!  Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
"
3,14,Cartman,"I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
"
3,14,Reenactor 1,"Yeah.
"
3,14,Reenactor 2,"Yeah.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!
"
3,14,Reenactor 3,"Yeah.
"
3,14,Reenactor 4,"Yeah.
"
3,14,Randy,"Well, the Union be damned!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Let's go!
"
3,14,Men,"Yeah! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.
"
3,14,Kyle,"They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
"
3,14,Kenny,"(Woohoo!) 
"
3,14,Mailman,"Oh good morning, Mrs. Hollis.
"
3,14,Mrs. Hollis,"Hello, Ralph.
"
3,14,Ralph,"Did you happen to catch that ball game last night?
"
3,14,Mrs. Hollis,"I'm afraid I was grading papers pretty late and- 
"
3,14,Driver,"What's that noise, officer? 
"
3,14,South Park Men,"Yeah! Yeah!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee!
"
3,14,Officer,"Ow!
"
3,14,Stuart,"Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell! 
"
3,14,Jimbo,"It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!
"
3,14,Reenactors,"Yeah!
"
3,14,Randy,"Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!
"
3,14,Ralph,"Uh-uh-uh schnapps? Uhm, uh-uh-I guess that would be at the liquor store.
"
3,14,Randy,"WHERE?!
"
3,14,Ralph,"At the liquor store, at the liquor stohohohohore!
"
3,14,Randy,"Come on, boys! 
"
3,14,Mrs. Hollis,"This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Excuse meh.
"
3,14,Stan,"Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
"
3,14,Kyle,"I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
"
3,14,Stan,"Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
"
3,14,Butters,"Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. 
"
3,14,Stan,"What battlefield?!
"
3,14,Butters,"Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
"
3,14,Stan,"God damnit, that fat piece of shit!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
"
3,14,Stan,"That would suck so much ass.
"
3,14,Kyle,"We have to stop him, dude.
"
3,14,Stan,"I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
"
3,14,Butters,"Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
"
3,14,Kyle,"We'll give you 10 bucks.
"
3,14,Butters,"Oh. O-oh, okay.
"
3,14,Reporter,"...And she was forced to live off her own feces for several days. In national news,  a frightening radical group from Colorado is making its way across the Southern states of America.  The group is recruiting new members in every town they pass through, and rapidly growing in number.  So authorities have decided to call in the National Guard. The groups seems to be led by military mastermind and right-wing radical Jimbo Kern , who is known for his guerrilla-fighting and leadership skills.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick.  Blouach.
"
3,14,Stan,"Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
"
3,14,Grandpa,"Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed.
"
3,14,Man,"Aaaaa!
"
3,14,Brunet,"They say you can either fight them or join them.
"
3,14,Blond,"Well I'm joining them. Those blanks hurt!
"
3,14,Stan,"Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.
"
3,14,Randy,"Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!
"
3,14,Kyle,"You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
"
3,14,Gerald,"This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Hey! There's some more schnapps over here!
"
3,14,Gerald,"More schnapps! 
"
3,14,Sgt. Larsen,"I'm Sgt. Larsen of the National Guard. We're here to stop the terrorists.
"
3,14,Grandpa,"They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado.
"
3,14,Larsen,"Well, we can't just shoot 'em; there's innocents and children about. Dawkins!
"
3,14,Dawkins,"Sir!
"
3,14,Larsen,"Fire a warning flare!
"
3,14,Dawkins,"Yes sir! 
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Medic! 
"
3,14,Larsen,"Woops.
"
3,14,Stan,"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
"
3,14,Grandpa,"You bastards!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Hey!
"
3,14,Soldier,"We can't fire at them, sir. There are too many children.
"
3,14,Larsen,"Then how do we stop them?
"
3,14,Stan,"I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.
"
3,14,Stan,"There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.
"
3,14,Grandpa,"Nice thinkin', Billy.
"
3,14,Larsen,"Let's go. 
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Where to next, General?
"
3,14,Cartman,"Where did the Confederates go, son?
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Um, sure.  What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?
"
3,14,Randy,"We're out of s'more schnapps?
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"That can't be.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"I guess we drank it all.
"
3,14,Dawkins,"Now what?
"
3,14,Stan,"Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
3,14,Soldier 1,"Uugh.
"
3,14,Soldier 2,"Ouch.
"
3,14,Randy,"Oh, my head.
"
3,14,Gerald,"Where am I?
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had.
"
3,14,Ned,"Mmm-oh. Gmm-oh, my head.
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today.
"
3,14,Stuart,"Me, too.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Where are you going?
"
3,14,Jimbo,"We're goin' home kid. Come on. 
"
3,14,Cartman,"We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! 
"
3,14,Randy,"Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.
"
3,14,Cartman,"No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
"
3,14,Stan,"Haha! You lose, fatass!
"
3,14,Cartman,"God, I hate you guys!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
"
3,14,Stan,"Where are you going?
"
3,14,Cartman,"This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! 
"
3,14,Randy,"Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here.
"
3,14,Stuart,"Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? 
"
3,14,Suzette,"Allo, I am Suzette, the S'more Schnapps girl.  We are pleased to sponsor you with all the S'more Schnapps you need.
"
3,14,Randy,"Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.
"
3,14,Gerald,"Me neither.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.
"
3,14,Suzette,"Yes, please. Do a shot out of my breasts. 
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Hey, look! Ned's doin' his trick again! 
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of ""grab ass.""
"
3,14,Gerald,"What's ""grab ass?""
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
"
3,14,Randy,"Ey, that sounds fun. 
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"Hohoho.
"
3,14,Solders,"I got you. Oo-oh. 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.
"
3,14,Jimbo,"You heard the General.
"
3,14,Soldiers,"Yeah! 
"
3,14,Stan,"Oh, no.
"
3,14,Kyle,"We'll never stop them now.
"
3,14,Soldiers,"Woohoo!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yes! Yes!
"
3,14,Guide,"Throughout 1861 the Confederate authorities tried to drive out the Union occupants of Fort Sumter peacefully. But Abraham Lincoln's administration would not surrender the fort to the Confederates, so Jefferson Davis decided to take action.
"
3,14,Tourist,"And the Confederates won the fort?
"
3,14,Guide,"Yes.  Imagine what it must have been like: you're a Union soldier stationed at this fort, and one day, you look out and see thousands of Confederates ready to pounce on you.  Uh...
"
3,14,Cartman,"Take the fort!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Charge!
"
3,14,Men,"Yeah!  Woohoo, yeah, come on!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"We got it! The fort is ours! 
"
3,14,Randy,"What was that?? 
"
3,14,Larsen,"Attention political activists: you are on government historical document property! Surrender the document with your hands up! If you would like a tour of the fort, one can be arranged through the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce.
"
3,14,Stan,"Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Suck my ass!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"What do we do, General? We're outnumbered.
"
3,14,Cartman,"We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
"
3,14,Larsen,"Alright, that does it. Blow the whole thing up.
"
3,14,Stan,"No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.
"
3,14,Larsen,"Sorry, son. We tried it your way; now we do it our way. Prepare the mortar.
"
3,14,Elderly Voice,"Hold it right there! 
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"I knew they would!
"
3,14,Stan,"Aw, damnit!
"
3,14,Leader,"We're ready to fight with ya. Long live the Confederacy!
"
3,14,Men,"Yee-haw! All right!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?! 
"
3,14,Al Gore,"Oh boy, this doesn't look good.
"
3,14,Advisor,"It's just like the Million Man March, except that there actually are a million people.
"
3,14,Aide,"Mr. President! A message for you from the extremists! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
"
3,14,Clinton,"Oh, dear God! Wuh-we have to meet their demands.
"
3,14,Advisor,"What?? Sir, there's- there's not that many of them.
"
3,14,Al Gore,"As Vice-Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them?
"
3,14,Clinton,"My hands are tied. Tell General Lee that I'll meet him in front of the Capitol.
"
3,14,Aide,"Sir!
"
3,14,Al Gore,"I'm so glad I don't have your job. 
"
3,14,Stan,"Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
"
3,14,Grandpa,"Damnit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it!
"
3,14,Stan,"Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?
"
3,14,Grandpa,"Wait a minute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson! 
"
3,14,Clinton,"All right, I'm gonna sign the document declarin' the Confederacy winners of the Civil War.
"
3,14,Confederates,"Hooray!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei.
"
3,14,Cartman,"I don't. I made it up. 
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Hey! Who's that?!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
"
3,14,Stan,"Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.
"
3,14,Clinton,"Boy, this just keeps getting weirder, doesn't it?
"
3,14,Cartman,"What the hell are you guys doing?!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!
"
3,14,Stan,"Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.
"
3,14,Cartman,"What?!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
"
3,14,Confederates,"Wow!
"
3,14,Randy,"A whole year?
"
3,14,Jimbo,"All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted.
"
3,14,Clinton,"That's it? I-I don't have to sign this thing? 
"
3,14,Gerald,"Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back.
"
3,14,Cartman,"No! We still have to fight!
"
3,14,Jimbo,"Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over.
"
3,14,Cartman,"NOOO!!
"
3,14,Stan,"It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH!
"
3,14,Clinton,"Boys, as President of the United States, I want to commend you for stopping the rebel uprising.
"
3,14,Stan,"Don't touch me. 
"
3,14,Kyle,"Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit!
"
3,14,Stan,"Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
"
3,14,Cartman,"Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
"
3,14,Kyle,"What??
"
3,14,Cartman,"The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
"
3,14,Clinton,"Eh, he's right, boys. Slavery is illegal and immoral, partially in thanks to the North winning the Civil War.
"
3,14,Stan,"Awwww!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Hahahaha haa ha!
"
3,14,Stan,"Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah. Thanks, dick!
"
3,15,Anchor,"Fighting the frizzies, at 11.
"
3,15,Mailman,"We've all heard of Rudolph and his shiny nose
And we all know Frosty who's made out of snow
But all of those stories seem kind of... gay
Cuz we all know who brightens up our holiday!
"
3,15,Mailman and Kids,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
"
3,15,Mailman,"Small and brown, he comes from you.
"
3,15,Mailman and Kids,"Sit on the toilet; here he comes!
"
3,15,Mailman,"Squeeze in 'tween your festive buns. 
A present from down below, 
Spreading joy with a
"
3,15,Mailman and Kids,"Howdy Ho!
"
3,15,Mailman,"He's seen the love inside of you, 'cause
"
3,15,Mailman and Kids,"He's a piece of poo!
"
3,15,Mailman,"Sometimes he's nutty ,
sometimes he's corny .
He can be brown or greenish brown .
"
3,15,Kids,"Mmm-mmm.
"
3,15,Mailman,"But if you eat fiber on Christmas Eve, 
He might come to your town. 
"
3,15,Mailman and Kids,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
"
3,15,Mailman,"He loves me, I love you. 
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
"
3,15,Bradley Biggle,"I can make a Mr. Hankey, too! 
"
3,15,Mr. Hankey,"HOWDY HO!
I'm Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
Season's greetings to all of you.
Let's sing songs and dance and play 
Now, before I melt away 
Here's a game I like to play:
Stick me in your mouth and try to say,
"
3,15,All,"""Howdy ho ho, yum yum yum.""
"
3,15,Mr. Hankey,"Christmastime has come!
"
3,15,Girl 1,"Sometimes he's runny.
"
3,15,Boy 1,"Sometimes he's firm.
"
3,15,Girl 2,"Sometimes he's practically water.
"
3,15,Man on Porto Potty,"Sometimes he hangs off the end of your ass
And won't fall in the toilet
Cuz he's just clinging to your sphincter
And he won't drop off and so you ...shake your ass around
And try to get it to drop into the toilet
And finally it does.. 
"
3,15,Mailman and Kids,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
"
3,15,Mailman,"When Christmas leaves; he must leave too. 
"
3,15,Mailman and Kids,"Flush him down, but he's ne-ver gone!
His smell and his spirit ling-ers on!
"
3,15,Kids,"Howdy Ho!
"
3,15,Mr. Hankey,"Howdy-ho, folks. We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
"
3,15,Cartman,"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
"
3,15,Kyle,"Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
"
3,15,Cartman,"Sure. 
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews.. ...play stupid games
Jews... that's why they're lame.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
3,15,Kyle,"I made you out of clay.
"
3,15,Cartman,"...play stupid games.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
3,15,Kyle,"with dreidel I shall play.
"
3,15,Cartman,"that's why they're lame.
"

"
3,15,Satan,"Well, I tell you what: Maybe we'll have ourselves a little Christmas, right here! Come on, everyone, gather 'round!
String up the lights and light up the tree.
We're gonna make some revelry!
Spirits are high, so I can tell,
It's Christmastime in Hell.
Demons are nicer as you pass them by.
There's lots of demon toys to buy.
The snow is falling, and all is well.
It's
"
3,15,With Demons,"Christmastime in Hell!
"
3,15,Satan,"There goes Jeffrey Dahmer with a festive Christmas ham.
After he has sex with it, he'll eat up all he can.

"
3,15,With Choir,"For one day we all stop burning, and the flames are not so thick. 
All the screaming and the torture stops as we wait for Ol' Saint Nick!
So, 
String up the lights and light up the tree.
We're damned for all eternity.
But for just one day all is well.
It's Christmastime in Hell!!!
"
3,15,Satan,"Gather close together and make it quick!
We gotta make room for Andy Dick.

3,15,Mr. Hankey,"Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman.
"
3,15,Cartman,"And...
''O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shi-ning
It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-b-birth
O Holy Night, the- something, something, dis-- aah.
It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie.
Jesus was born, and so I get presents.
Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o)
Fall (Fall) 
On your knees (On your knees) 
And hear (Can't you hear)
The angels'.. something (Voices)
O night (O night)
Divine (Divine)
The night
When I get presents (O-o)
O night (O o-night) 
Di-viiine! 
O night (Ooo-ooo)
O night, di-vine! 
Oh. Ah. Ch.
"
3,15,Mr. Hankey,"Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison.
"
3,15,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season.
"
3,15,Class,"Awww.
"
3,15,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
3,15,Mr. Garrison,"Now, pay attention. Ahem...
I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East 
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs
They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday.
And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, 
Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes 
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday 
So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. 
There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. 
They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. 
They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about.
And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout,
Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. 
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. 
So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. 
Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.
They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,
Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.
In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. 
So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you. 
On Christmas Day, I travel 'round the world and say,
""Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too!
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you."" 
Uh, thank you, Mr. Hat.

Shut up, turds!

"
3,15,Mr. Hankey,"Golly, that sure was swell. I'd say my Christmas special is going super-fantastic. Well, now it's time to hear from perhaps the two most important people of the whole season.
"
3,15,Emcee,"Hello, everyone, and welcome to McKemick's. Now, please put your hands together and welcome... Saint Nicholas and Jesus Christ. 
"
3,15,Santa,"Hello, everybody!
"
3,15,Jesus,"How are y'all doing tonight?
"
3,15,Santa,"You know, Jesus, there've been so many songs written about us over the years.
"
3,15,Jesus,"That's right, Santa, and we love each and every one of them. Like this one.
Joy to the world, for I have come.
Let earth receive Me!
Let every heart prepare Me room. 
"
3,15,Santa,"And heaven and nature sing...
"
3,15,Jesus,"And heaven and nature sing...
"
3,15,Santa,"And heaven and nature sing...
"
3,15,Jesus,"And heaven and na-
"
3,15,Both,"And heaven and heaven and nature sing.
"
3,15,Santa,"You know, Jesus, that is a nice song, but I like... this one:
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old... me. 
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys
"
3,15,Both,"Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
"
3,15,Santa,"Up on the housetop, click click click.
Down through the chimney with good old... me.
"
3,15,Jesus,"He he hoo, get away! 
"
3,15,Santa,"Go away??
"
3,15,Jesus,"Get away.
"
3,15,Santa,"Where away?
"
3,15,Jesus,"Away in the manger, no crib for My bed
That's where cute little old Me lay down My sweet head.
The stars in the sky (Santa: Ooooo)
"
3,15,Both,"Looked down where I lay.
"
3,15,Jesus,"Cute little eight-pound me (Santa: Oo-oo)
"
3,15,Both,"asleep in (Santa: on) the hay.
"
3,15,Jesus,"O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye to Bethlehem to see-ee Me...
"
3,15,Santa,"Here's one, Jol-
"
3,15,Jesus,"Hark, the herald angels sing, Glory-
"
3,15,Santa,"Hey, it's my turn.
"
3,15,Jesus,"-to Me!
Silent Night,
"
3,15,Santa,"Uh.
"
3,15,Jesus,"Holy Night
"
3,15,Santa,"Santa Cl- em
"
3,15,Jesus,"All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon Virgin, Mother and Me.
"
3,15,Santa,"Saint Nicholas... can't think of one.
"
3,15,Jesus,"Holy Me, so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
"
3,15,Santa,"Okay, Jesus. Here's one you might remember:
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twistin' through the dusty land.
"
3,15,Jesus,"Uh. Santa, Santa, Santa, that's not a Christmas song, bud. Ah... that's-
"
3,15,Santa,"I know, but there's, like, three-hundred Jesus Christmas songs and only four fucking Santa ones! It's not fair! Just do it yourself! I'm leaving. 
"
3,15,Jesus,"Aw, come on, Santa. You can't leave.
"
3,15,Santa,"Aw, fuck you, Jesus!
"
3,15,Jesus,"But Santa... The weather outside is frightful
"
3,15,Santa,"Aw.
"
3,15,Jesus,"But the fire so delightful
"
3,15,Santa,"Well, since I've no place to go.
"
3,15,Both,"Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. 
"
3,15,Jesus,"It doesn't show signs of stoppin'.
"
3,15,Santa,"But I brought some corn for poopity-poppin'.
"
3,15,Jesus,"The lights are turned way down low, so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
"
3,15,Both,"The fire is slowly dyin',
"
3,15,Santa,"And, my dear, we're still good-bop-be-byein',
"
3,15,Jesus,"But as long as you love me so,
"
3,15,Both,"Let it snow, let it snow,
"
3,15,Jesus,"let it snow!
"
3,15,Santa,"Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand!

3,15,Kids,"Howdy-ho!
"
3,15,Mr. Hankey,"Well, I guess that's about the end of my Christmas album. Gosh! It was sure nice hangin' out with y'all again. Well, I guess if there's just... one thing I have left to say, it would be this:
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
May your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay. 
From now on, our troubles will be miles away.
"
3,15,With boys,"Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days, of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.
"
3,15,The Boys,"Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow.
"
3,15,Mr. Hankey,"Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.

"
3,15,Cartman,"Time to go, Mr. Hankey.

"
3,16,Cartman,"You guys! You guys!  Guess what?
"
3,16,Kyle,"What, fatass?!
"
3,16,Cartman,"I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! 
"
3,16,Kenny,"(...What?)
"
3,16,Stan,"No you didn't!
"
3,16,Cartman,"Yes! I really did.
"
3,16,Stan,"How do you know?
"
3,16,Cartman,"Well, because yesterday I got my period. 
"
3,16,Kyle,"You got your what?
"
3,16,Cartman,"My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.
"
3,16,Stan,"You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?
"
3,16,Miss Aliton,"Well boys, ah-I don't think I can tell you. Ah-
"
3,16,Stan,"Please, it's important.
"
3,16,Miss Aliton,"Well, it's when puberty hits and you bleed, you know, down there. 
"
3,16,Kyle,"Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! 
"
3,16,Cartman,"Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't.

3,16,Stan,"Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
3,16,Anchorman,"In local news, a stomach virus is going around that is causing bleeding of the colon in some small children. Doctors are telling parents that the virus is nothing to worry about and that the infections can be dealt with simple antibiotics.  Well, it's just four days until New Year's Eve, 1999. The new millennium is almost upon us, and all over the world people have started to celebrate by dancing, singing, and killing one another.  But probably the biggest event of the millennium is one happening in South Park, Colorado, where people have gathered for a chance to see Jesus Christ. Craig Netzel is standing by.
"
3,16,Netzel,"Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park.  Everyone is giddy with anticipation for Jesus to come out, because as we all know, if Jesus comes out of his house and is not scared by his shadow, it means the next thousand years will be full of peace and love.  Oh, it looks like Jesus might be coming out! 
"
3,16,Woman,"Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?
"
3,16,Boy,"He's neat, Mommy. 
"
3,16,Netzel,"Everyone is quiet here, Tom. Looks like the little fellow's a bit nervous.  But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us!
"
3,16,Jesus,"Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing?  Can I help you with something? 
"
3,16,Netzel,"...Well, it's... the millennium, Jesus.
"
3,16,Jesus,"Uuh-huh?
"
3,16,Netzel,"Well, it's ""The Millennium"".
"
3,16,Man 1,"Yeah.
"
3,16,Man 2,"Yeah.
"
3,16,Man 3,"Yeah.
"
3,16,Cameraman,"Right.
"
3,16,Jesus,"So, what happens at the millennium?
"
3,16,Netzel,"...I don't know.
"
3,16,Jimbo,"We thought you did.
"
3,16,Man 4,"Yeah!
"
3,16,Man 5,"Yeah, you're Jesus.
"
3,16,Man 6,"Hey!
"
3,16,Man 5,"You're the one in control.
"
3,16,Jesus,"Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace.
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah yeah yeah, we've heard that crap for about 2000 years now! We wanna hear somethin' new! It's the year 2000, for Christ's sake!
"
3,16,Crowd,"Yeah!
"
3,16,Jesus,"Well, what do ya want?
"
3,16,Fr. Maxi,"We want to see God!
"
3,16,Randy,"Yeah, with our own eyes.
"
3,16,Crowd,"Yeah!
"
3,16,Jimbo,"We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!
"
3,16,Crowd,"Yeah!
"
3,16,Woman,"That's right!
"
3,16,Jesus,"Oh. Uuuh, let me think about that for a minute. 
"
3,16,Man With Picket Sign,"Is that good?
"
3,16,Man 7,"I don't know.
"
3,16,Man 8,"I don't know. Is that good or not?!
"
3,16,Stan,"Hello?
"
3,16,Kyle,"Dude, did you get your period yet?
"
3,16,Stan,"No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
"
3,16,Stan,"Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Woohoo!  Woohoooo!)
"
3,16,Stan,"Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
"
3,16,Cartman,"Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!
"
3,16,Kenny,"(You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)
"
3,16,Cartman,"You did?
"
3,16,Kyle,"You got your period too, Kenny?
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)
"
3,16,Cartman,"Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Woo-hoo!)
"
3,16,Netzel,"Tom, it looked for a second as if Jesus was going to come out of his house, but then he went back inside. But meanwhile, more and more people are showing up to show their support for Jesus. 
"
3,16,Rancher,"Well, the way I see it, if he really is who he says he is, well then he'd better do somethin' on New Year's Eve, 'cause it's in the Bible!
"
3,16,Jesus,"Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me. 
"
3,16,God,"What is it, my child?
"
3,16,Jesus,"Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback!
"
3,16,God,"Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival.
"
3,16,Jesus,"It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you.
"
3,16,God,"Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me.
"
3,16,Jesus,"But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback.
"
3,16,God,"Be ye careful of pride, Jesus.
"
3,16,Jesus,"Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30.
"
3,16,God,"I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Ike, can I talk to you? 
"
3,16,Ike,"Uh ar, stufid.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
"
3,16,Ike,"Whoa won toooo-reeee.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
"
3,16,Ike,"No. Martur sucker. Moghee. Muckeh m'gwoss. Tabyudog.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
"
3,16,Ike,"Cokeh mocker.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Thanks a lot, Ike!
"
3,16,Stan,"So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
"
3,16,Cartman,"Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
"
3,16,Kenny,"(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
"
3,16,Cartman,"Tampon? What's a tampon?
"
3,16,Kenny,"(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)
"
3,16,Cartman,"Ew, doesn't that hurt?
"
3,16,Kenny,"(A little.)
"
3,16,Kyle,"You guys! I got my period, too!
"
3,16,Cartman,"Wow, cool!
"
3,16,Stan,"You did?
"
3,16,Kyle,"Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
"
3,16,Cartman,"All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Awesome! We get powers?
"
3,16,Cartman,"Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. 
"
3,16,Stan,"Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan 
"
3,16,Jesus,"Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!
"
3,16,Phillip,"Oh God, you're smelly!
"
3,16,Announcer,"Good morning, South Park, it's 8 a.m.,  and only two more days until the new millennium! 
"
3,16,Stan,"Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!
"
3,16,Sharon,"Stanley, honey, what's the matter?
"
3,16,Stan,"I'm not bleeding out my aahass!
"
3,16,Sharon,"Well, that's good, honey.
"
3,16,Stan,"No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.
"
3,16,Jimbo,"Here he comes!
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"He's coming out!
"
3,16,Jesus,"...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium.  I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded!  So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going! 
"
3,16,Man,"...We knew you could do it, Jesus! 
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas! 
"
3,16,Fr. Maxi,"For he is Savior
For he is Lord
"
3,16,Crowd,"He gives me hope when
I have only been bored
And he lifts me up with
His gentle arm...
"
3,16,Cartman,"Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?
"
3,16,Kyle,"Here.
"
3,16,Cartman,"Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Dammit, here!)
"
3,16,Cartman,"And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
"
3,16,Kyle,"I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)
"
3,16,Cartman,"Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
"
3,16,Cartman,"What's the matter, Kyle?
"
3,16,Kyle,"Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
"
3,16,Cartman,"...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
"
3,16,Kenny,"(And mine too.)
"
3,16,Kyle,"Phew.
"
3,16,Chef,"Oh, hello Stan.
"
3,16,Stan,"Hey, Chef.
"
3,16,Chef,"How's it going?
"
3,16,Stan,"Bad.
"
3,16,Chef,"Why bad?
"
3,16,Stan,"Can I come in?
"
3,16,Chef,"Well, sure.  Now, what's the matter, little cracker?
"
3,16,Stan,"Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.
"
3,16,Chef,"OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly.
"
3,16,Stan,"No.
"
3,16,Chef,"Your little girlfriend, Wendy.
"
3,16,Stan,"Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.
"
3,16,Chef,"Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?
"
3,16,Stan,"Yeah, Cartman told us.
"
3,16,Chef,"Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you. 
"
3,16,Stan,"Okay.
"
3,16,Chef,"Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby.
Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby.
Ooo yeah, yes yes baby
Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now
Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby!
Ewww, baby! No, no!
Alright now—I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay.
Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.
Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?
"
3,16,Stan,"...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.
"
3,16,Chef,"...Is that what I said?
"
3,16,Stan,"But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! 
"
3,16,Chef,"Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.
"
3,16,Agent,"I can't tell you how excited Rod Stewart is about this millennium concert. He's gotten a little older, but you're gonna see how much he can still rock.
"
3,16,Jesus,"Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God.
"
3,16,Agent,"Yeah t-and uh, you know, Rod is a seasoned veteran, so I'm gonna have to ask for a bit more cash, but we could talk about that later; here comes Rod now. 
"
3,16,Rod,"Hullo-o-o.
"
3,16,Jesus,"Hey, Rod, great to see you.
"
3,16,Rod,"Oh.
"
3,16,Jesus,"Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!
"
3,16,Rod,"Pooped pants.
"
3,16,Jesus,"What?
"
3,16,Rod,"Pooped pants.
"
3,16,Jesus,"Poo pants?
"
3,16,Rod,"Pooped 'nmuh pants.
"
3,16,Jesus,"Uh, you pooped your pants?
"
3,16,Rod,"Pooped in my pants.
"
3,16,Jesus,"Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?
"
3,16,Nurse,"Again?!  Now, Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie? 
"
3,16,Dr. Mephesto,"Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one.
"
3,16,Stan,"But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
"
3,16,Dr. Mephesto,"Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty?
"
3,16,Stan,"Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad.
"
3,16,Dr. Mephesto,"Your father never went through puberty?
"
3,16,Stan,"No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.
"
3,16,Dr. Mephesto,"Oh, I can't say that I blame him.
"
3,16,Stan,"So do you know anything that can help him?
"
3,16,Dr. Mephesto,"Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones.
"
3,16,Stan,"Hormones? 
"
3,16,Dr. Mephesto,"Yes!  Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me.
"
3,16,Stan,"Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! 
"
3,16,Dr. Mephesto,"My pleasure. I just love helping people.
"
3,16,Cartman,"Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. 
"
3,16,Kyle,"Okay. Today's word is ""spirituality."" What that means to me is uh- 
"
3,16,Stan,"Hey assholes! 
"
3,16,Cartman,"Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
"
3,16,Stan,"Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
"
3,16,Kyle,"Hormones?
"
3,16,Stan,"Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
"
3,16,Kyle,"Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
"
3,16,Cartman,"Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
"
3,16,Stan,"So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
"
3,16,Cartman,"Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
"
3,16,Stan,"Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. 
"
3,16,Cartman,"Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Ooooowwwwwwwhh.) 
"
3,16,Cartman,"Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Oh- ooowww!)
"
3,16,Cartman,"Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Aaaaaa!) 
"
3,16,Kyle,"Whoa, dude!
"
3,16,Dr. Doctor,"Mr. and Ms. McCormick.
"
3,16,McCormick Parents,"Yes?
"
3,16,Dr. Doctor,"I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son.
"
3,16,Ms. McCormick,"Oh my God, my little Kenny's gone. I can't believe it.
"
3,16,Dr. Doctor,"We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do.
"
3,16,Stuart,"What happened? What killed him, doctor?
"
3,16,Dr. Doctor,"Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank.
"
3,16,Ms. McCormick,"Oh my God.
"
3,16,Dr. Doctor,"My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.
"
3,16,Ms. McCormick,"Gi-ih 
"
3,16,Dr. Doctor,"We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to catch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show.
"
3,16,Stuart,"Rod Stewart's gonna be in Vegas?
"
3,16,Netzel,"Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas, where tomorrow night THE New Year's Eve event is going to happen. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is presenting Rod Stewart, the undisputed King of Pop, right here at this hotel behind me.  It looks as though Jesus really has come through.  Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event.
"
3,16,Jesus,"What??
"
3,16,Netzel,"How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night?
"
3,16,Ma'am,"Of course he is. This is Jesus we're talking about. He wouldn't let us down.
"
3,16,Jesus,"Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow?  ...Hello?
"
3,16,Sharon,"Stanley.  Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas. 
"
3,16,Stan,"Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.
"
3,16,Cartman,"Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. 
"
3,16,Jesus,"Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?!  Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Hey, here comes Stan.
"
3,16,Stan,"Have I missed anything?
"
3,16,Cartman,"Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Did you get your period yet, Stan?
"
3,16,Stan,"No. I didn't, but-
"
3,16,Cartman,"Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. 
"
3,16,Jesus,"Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod ""Do You Think I'm Sexy?"" Stewart! 
"
3,16,Rod,"O-o-oh.  O-oh.  O-o-o-oh. Be-eh-o-o-or. 
"
3,16,Jimbo,"Whoa, man.
"
3,16,Rod,"Oh. Uh pooped 'em. 
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"This sucks balls!
"
3,16,Blonde,"Yeah!
"
3,16,Man 7,"Alright, enough of this! Bring out God!
"
3,16,Man 9,"Yeah!
"
3,16,Jesus,"Oh no.
"
3,16,Crowd,"We want God! We want God! We want God!
"
3,16,Jesus,"Please, Father. Do something.
"
3,16,Crowd,"We want God!
"
3,16,Jesus,"Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight.
"
3,16,Randy,"We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
"
3,16,Woman,"This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!
"
3,16,Skeeter,"Let's get him! 
"
3,16,Netzel,"Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as ""the gayest party ever."" Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. 
"
3,16,Stan,"Jesus, why does God hate me?
"
3,16,Jesus,"Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again.
"
3,16,Stan,"He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
"
3,16,Jesus,"Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.
"
3,16,Stan,"Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?
"
3,16,Jesus,"Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life.
"
3,16,Stan,"What do you mean?
"
3,16,Jesus,"If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems.  A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence.  That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party.
"
3,16,Stan,"I just wanted my period.
"
3,16,Jesus,"I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own.  I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment. 
"
3,16,Man,"Whoa, what is that??
"
3,16,Jesus,"It's Dad.
"
3,16,Fr. Maxi,"God? God is going to show himself??
"
3,16,Woman,"Look, I can see him. 
"
3,16,Jesus,"Father. You came.
"
3,16,God,"Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me.  Be ye not afraid.  Blessed art thou, my children. 
"
3,16,Randy,"That's God?
"
3,16,Jesus,"Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega.  The Beginning and the End.
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"Well, yeah, but that??
"
3,16,God,"What did you expect me to look like, My son?
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"...Well not like that!
"
3,16,God,"Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question.
"
3,16,Gerald,"One question?
"
3,16,Mr. Mackey,"Only one?
"
3,16,Sharon,"What should we ask him?
"
3,16,Chef,"We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, ""What's the meaning of life?"" or ""Why are we here?"".
"
3,16,Stan,"I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! 
"
3,16,God,"My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it.
"
3,16,Kyle,"How do know that?
"
3,16,God,"You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man — with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven. 
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??
"
3,16,God,"I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000. 
"
3,16,Stan,"Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...
"
3,16,Skeeter,"Let's get him.
"
3,16,Stan,"Let's have a cup o-Aaaa! 
"
3,17,Announcer,"This Saturday, Pox presents the musical event of the new millennium! You all remember playing the recorder in elementary school!  Well, this Saturday in Oklahoma City , over 4 million third-grade students  from all over the country  will gather in one place, and at the same time, play ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders.  It's the largest third-grade recorder concert ever!  Special guest conductor Yoko Ono  and woodwind virtuoso Kenny G  will lead this fantastic event! This Saturday, at 11 Eastern / 10 Central. The world will be watching! 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma.
"
3,17,Class,"Awww.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?!  Recorders up.  And a-1 and a-2 and a-  ""...of liberty."" You're late!  ""...my father-"" What the hell was that?!  God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering!
"
3,17,Cartman,"That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Shut up, fatass!
"
3,17,Cartman,"Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up.  And a-1 and a-2 and a- 
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, that sounded great, kids. 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Arkansas?
"
3,17,Stan,"What's Arkansas—is that a state?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay? 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live there—my  ...father still lives there.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Well, don't you want to see them?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay?  Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"When was that?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested you when you were a boy?  Mr. Garrison, I think, when we get to Arkansas, you need to see your father. You need to face this demon in your closet, m'kay?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! 
"
3,17,Cartman,"That was pretty cool.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay.
"
3,17,Cartman,"Okay, how about this one, Kenny? 
"
3,17,Kenny,"(Uh-uh.)
"
3,17,Cartman,"No? How about this? 
"
3,17,Kenny,"(Nope.)
"
3,17,Cartman,"Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
3,17,Cartman,"We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
"
3,17,Stan,"What's ""lose bowel control?""
"
3,17,Cartman,"That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
"
3,17,Cartman,"Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Nuh-uh!
"
3,17,Cartman,"How about this one, Kenny? 
"
3,17,Kenny,"(Nuh-uh.)
"
3,17,Kyle,"There is no brown noise, fat boy!
"
3,17,Cartman,"That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
"
3,17,Stan,"Who's Karen Carpenter?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Aaaaaah!  Huhh, ohh, 
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Mr. Garrison, are you alright?
"
3,17,Mr. Hat,"Mr. Garrison isn't here right now.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?
"
3,17,Mr. Hat,"Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father.
"
3,17,Mr. Hat,"No! No, you moron!  Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?!
"
3,17,Mr. Hat,"Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"What did you say?!
"
3,17,Mr. Hat,"You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Why, you son of a bitch! 
"
3,17,Stan,"Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. 
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"I'm gonna kick your ass, m'kay?! 
"
3,17,Students,"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
"
3,17,Ms. Crabtree,"BE QUIET BACK THERE!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Yuh-NO!  You may have won this time, Mr. Hat.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move!
"
3,17,Coordinator,"School?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Excuse me?
"
3,17,Coordinator,"What school are you from?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, uh we're from South Park, Colorado?
"
3,17,Coordinator,"Ssss, alright. South Park school, you go over there next to the kids from New York.  Nono, don't put the Florida kids in the building! 
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Ey! Look at the little Eskimos in their freakin' hats and gloves.
"
3,17,Tough Guy 2,"Yeah, huh? 
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Whoa, look at this kid's coat.  Ey, kid. What's the matter—you a freakin' burn victim or somethin'? What? 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Who the hell are these guys?
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"I didn't know they was invitin' rednecks to this event!
"
3,17,Stan,"We're not rednecks!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Oh yeah? Well, you look like a bunch of queefs to me, huh?! 
"
3,17,Cartman,"Stan, what's a queef?
"
3,17,Kyle,"Kenny?
"
3,17,Kenny,"(I don't know!)
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!
"
3,17,Cartman,"Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!
"
3,17,Black kid,"Oh yeah? Well, what is it, then?!
"
3,17,Cartman,"Aaaa-
"
3,17,Stan,"Why?! Don't you know?!
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Alright, dickhole! 
"
3,17,Coordinator,"I need everyone's attention, please! We will now all be moving in an orderly fashion to our assigned hotels. Please follow your group leader to check in.
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Yeah see ya later, queefs! 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere! 
"
3,17,Stan,"Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
"
3,17,Stan,"Damnit! 
"
3,17,Cartman,"Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!
"
3,17,Stan,"You did? 
"
3,17,Kyle,"What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
"
3,17,Cartman,"I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise.""
"
3,17,Kyle,"Awwgh!
"
3,17,Stan,"Damnit Cartman, wha-?!
"
3,17,Cartman,"""An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean?
"
3,17,Stan,"Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I can do this. I have to do this.  Hello. Dad.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Oh, hello, son.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Can I ...come in?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Ub. Sure, of course.  Your mom's out at Bridge Night. You want a beer or somethin'?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Uh, what?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Uh, okay, like what?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it!  I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"What??
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I have to know why! Right here and now—we're gonna talk about this!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I know! I wanna know why not?!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"WHAT??
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Was it that I was ugly?!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Oh, my God! 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Well, NO!! 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy! 
"
3,17,Coordinator,"Alright, everyone, quiet please! There are over 4 million of you, so we must have quiet! At this time I would like to introduce the woman who is making this all possible, Yoko Ono! 
"
3,17,Yoko Ono,"Please ... sing song ""My Country 'Tis of Thee.""
"
3,17,Coordinator,"You heard her, We'll start the rehearsal in a few minutes.
"
3,17,Stan,"Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
"
3,17,Stan,"No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
"
3,17,Stan,"What word could we make up?
"
3,17,Kyle,"How about... finkleroy?
"
3,17,Stan,"No, uhno, not finkleroy.
"
3,17,Cartman,"How about geebo, or, or mung?
"
3,17,Stan,"Yeah, mung.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Mung's good.
"
3,17,Stan,"Sh. Here they come. 
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Well hel-lo there, queefs. All bundled up nice and warm, are we?
"
3,17,Stan,"You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
"
3,17,Tough Guy 2,"We're not mung. You're mung.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Of course we know what mung means!
"
3,17,Athlete,"Yeah, D'ya think we wouldn't know what mung means? 
"
3,17,Stan,"We busted you!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"You guys are even stupider than I thought! Mung is so a word!
"
3,17,Stan,"It is?
"
3,17,New Yorkers,"Yeah. 
"
3,17,Athlete,"It sure is.
"
3,17,New Yorker 1,"Yeah.
"
3,17,New Yorker 2,"Uh huh. 
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Eewww.
"
3,17,Stan,"Ooogh.
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"You guys didn't know that?  Come on, guys. Let's get away from these rednecks before we get redneckasitis, or somethin'! 
"
3,17,Stan,"You dumbass, Cartman!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
"
3,17,Mrs. Garrison Sr.,"It's so nice to see you, son. I'm so proud that you're part of the 4 Million Child Recorder Blow.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about.
"
3,17,Mrs. Garrison Sr.,"About what?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?
"
3,17,Mrs. Garrison Sr.,"That... that can't be.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"He never did, Mom, not once.
"
3,17,Mrs. Garrison Sr.,"That's not true! Your father loved you! Often!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!
"
3,17,Mrs. Garrison Sr.,"Nohoho! No! If I knew I would have made him do it!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep!
"
3,17,Mrs. Garrison Sr.,"I'm not listening!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Face it, Mother. He never abused me! 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Uh, what's goin' on?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Mother won't hear the truth!
"
3,17,Mrs. Garrison Sr.,"He says you didn't molest him as a child!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Ah-I didn't! You knew I didn't!
"
3,17,Mrs. Garrison Sr.,"No! I didn't know!  I'm not listening!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"You can't close your eyes forever, Mother!  Mother, wait! 
"
3,17,Yoko Ono,"Alright people, how many people has a copy. We must have-a practiced the ... song for the performance tomorrow, please.
"
3,17,Coordinator,"Okay, children. We need to play closer attention to the sheet music. Remember, if you get lost, just follow along with Mr. Kenny G here.
"
3,17,Cartman,"Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
"
3,17,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
3,17,Yoko Ono,"And-a one gop seven to-sand ...  O-o-o-o. Stop! Stop ... beh goos sa buh got pee you got dere. That was-a terrify! That was-a horri-bee! What we gonna do?!
"
3,17,Kyle,"What the hell is that lady talking about?
"
3,17,Stan,"I have no idea.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, Mr. Garrison, Sr.?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Thuh, that's me.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, my name is Mr. Mackey. I'm your school counselor, m'kay.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"What can I do for ya?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Uh-I wanna talk to you about your son—I'm his n-therapist, m'kay.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Eh, you didn't?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"No! He's upset because I didn't molest him!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"A little, yeah! He thinks if I don't molest him it means I don't love him.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about ""sexual molestation"", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"I didn't do it because it's wrong!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year old son?!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, ""How far will I go to save my son's life?""
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Well, I won't have sex with him!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Well, I've said all I can say.  I know it's difficult, but... family... is about compromises. m'kay?  Don't lose your son over this, Mr. Garrison.  Don't lose... your son, m'kay? 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Am I the only sane person left on earth?!
"
3,17,Reporter,"Tomorrow the whole world will be tuning in as over 4 million children play ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders.  It is by far the largest gathering of little plastic recorders in human history. Yoko Ono has...
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Good night. 
"
3,17,Reporter,"Words to live by.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Uh huh.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Now, I don't really have any pajamas—guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Should be fine.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Won't be necessary.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I'll just... be going up to bed now.  Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"I'm not going to molest you!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"You don't love me!  I wanna die!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"God-damnit! 
"
3,17,Stan,"I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Yeah. They think they're so cool.
"
3,17,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Calm down, Cartman.
"
3,17,Stan,"You found what?
"
3,17,Cartman,"The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  There, okay. Let's see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?
"
3,17,Kenny,"(Ready.)  (Oh,  shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom!) 
"
3,17,Stan,"No way.
"
3,17,Kyle,"I don't believe it!
"
3,17,Cartman,"Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch.  Okay. 
"
3,17,Delivery Man,"Whoa- Oh, my God!  Aaww, I crapped my pants! 
"
3,17,Kyle,"That's amazing.
"
3,17,Cartman,"I told you guys!
"
3,17,Stan,"Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
"
3,17,Cartman,"That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
"
3,17,Stan,"No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
"
3,17,Cartman,"Ooooh.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Yeah, dude!
"
3,17,Cartman,"They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.
"
3,17,Patron 1,"Ey, what's the matter there, Garrison? You look kinda sad.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Well, I'm having some troubles at home.
"
3,17,Patron 1,"Well, come on. Tell us about it. We always help each other out, don't we, fellas?
"
3,17,Patron 2,"Yeah.
"
3,17,Patron 3,"Yeah, that's right.
"
3,17,Patron 1,"Yeah.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right?
"
3,17,Patron 2,"Sure!
"
3,17,Patron 3,"Yeah we are!
"
3,17,Blond,"I am. I know that.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question?
"
3,17,Patron 1,"Absolutely.
"
3,17,Patron 2,"Of course.
"
3,17,Patron 4,"Yeah, man.
"
3,17,Patron 5,"Come on, Garrison!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life? 
"
3,17,Patron 2,"...Oh, this is one of them Scruples questions, ain't it?
"
3,17,Patron 1,"Nono, I got a better one: Would you have sex with your mother... to save your father's life?
"
3,17,Patrons,"Wooo, yeah.
"
3,17,Patron 2,"Oh, like if someone had a gun to your father's head and said, ""Have sex with your mother or else I'll shoot him""?
"
3,17,Patron 1,"Yeah.
"
3,17,Patron 2,"Oh, that's a tough one.
"
3,17,Patron 3,"Hmmm.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"No no wait, uh, you don't understand.
"
3,17,Blond,"How about if someone made you have sex with your mother and father to save your own life?
"
3,17,Patrons,"No, no, no way. No.
"
3,17,Patron 6,"But if it was to save my mother's life, uh-I think I would have to have sex with my father.
"
3,17,Patron 7,"Yeup.
"
3,17,Patron 8,"Me, too.
"
3,17,Patron 9,"Well, I think that goes without saying.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son.
"
3,17,Patron 8,"Well, personally, I would have sex with my son to save to save my mother's life. It depends, uh- how big a gun are we talkin' here?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Uh, he doesn't have a gun.
"
3,17,Blond,"The father doesn't have a gun?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"No! Nobody's got a gun!
"
3,17,Patron 3,"I think if someone said, ""Have sex with your mother or else I'm gonna kill your son,"" but he didn't have a gun, I wouldn't do it.
"
3,17,Patron 2,"He could have a knife, though.
"
3,17,Patron 1,"Yeah.
"
3,17,Patron 3,"Sure.
"
3,17,Patron 1,"Yeah, a knife.
"
3,17,Bartender,"If a killer put a knife to my throat, and said, ""Have sex with your father or else I'm gonna kill your mother while having sex with you,"" ...I would have sex with myself.
"
3,17,Patron 1,"...Yeah, I would 
"
3,17,Patron 2,"That's right.
"
3,17,Patron 3,"Uh huh.
"
3,17,Bartender,"That makes sense.
"
3,17,Patron 10,"Mm-hm.
"
3,17,Patron 1,"Wasn't that right?
"
3,17,Patron 3,"Mm, See?
"
3,17,Stan,"How do we write he note, Cartman?
"
3,17,Cartman,"Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. 
"
3,17,Stan,"Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it.
"
3,17,Cartman,"Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
"
3,17,Stan,"Okay, let's get back to the room. 
"
3,17,Coordinator,"What's this??  ""Revised Music for Tomorrow""?? Chip, did you get revised music for tomorrow??
"
3,17,Chip,"What??
"
3,17,Coordinator,"Ms. Ono has made revisions again! We've got to get these copied 4 million times and make the revisions to the projected music! Come on! Hurry! 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Dad?  Pop, I'm just fast asleep—I'm not hearing anything. 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon.
"
3,17,Mrs. Garrison Sr.,"Are you sure you can't stay one more night, son?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"Well, I just hope that NOW we can put the past behind us and, and try to be a normal family again.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to.
"
3,17,Mrs. Garrison Sr.,"We'll be watching on TV. Make us proud, son.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I will.  Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad!  Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face...
"
3,17,Mrs. Garrison Sr.,"You did the right thing, Poppa.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison Sr.,"I didn't do squat!  Here you go, a hundred bucks. 
"
3,17,Kenny G.,"Oh, that's okay. Keep your money. Thanks. 
"
3,17,Announcer,"Live, from Oklahoma City!  Four million third-grade students  from all over the country  playing ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders... ""MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE"" special.
"
3,17,Stan,"Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
"
3,17,Kyle,"We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
"
3,17,Kenny G,"Are we all ready to play?  Thanks. Okay.  Let's see the music! 
"
3,17,Kyle,"This is gonna be sweet!
"
3,17,Stan,"Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed! 
"
3,17,Cartman,"Uh-oh. 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
"
3,17,Yoko Ono,"One, two, sign paytah. 
"
3,17,"Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman","No! 
"
3,17,Stan,"Stop! Stop! 
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, aren't those our boys?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, no. What are they doing?
"
3,17,"Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman","Noooo!!! 
"
3,17,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in New York City, but it could just as well be any town on Earth right now. The desolation, the damage is exactly the same in every city the whole world over. It's been just under 20 hours since everyone on Earth pooped their pants, and people still roam their damaged homes with disbelief, and loss. Rick?
"
3,17,Rick,"Alan, I'm standing at ground zero. Here, the damage is greater than anywhere.  Like the rest of the world, everyone here has crapped their pants. Some  crapped themselves to death. And still others ...ruined perfectly good pairs of pants. A nation mourns and tries to rebuild, but the big question that remains is, ""How did this happen?"" 
"
3,17,Kenny G.,"Well, I see. Other than making everyone in the world crap their pants, our event went over really well.
"
3,17,Yoko Ono,"Wery well?! Wery well?! You're gonna be on Ricki Lake, I tell you again! Look at ad a bah godda circada she doin wery well?!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Alright, come on, everybody. We've got a long bus ride back to Colorado, m'kay? 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
"
3,17,Stan,"Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. 
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas, m'kay. 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Huh?
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Here they are!
"
3,17,Tough Guy 2,"Yeah!
"
3,17,Stan,"Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Ey! Not so fast! We know it was you guys that changed the music and made everyone on Earth crap their pants!
"
3,17,Stan,"Uuuuh...
"
3,17,Tough Guy 2,"Yeah, we knows all about it!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Oh, no!
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Huh?
"
3,17,Stan,"You do?
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Sure. I mean, everyone on Earth shit themselves 'cause of you. And that's pretty cool. I mean, that's pretty amazing!
"
3,17,Tough Guy 2,"Yeah, we was wrong about you guys. We're sorry.
"
3,17,Cartman,"Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
"
3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Yeah. See you guys later. 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus.  Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G.
"
3,17,Kenny G,"Huhuh, good- good-bye. 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"M-m-m.  Oh, well, thank you!  You know, it's funny: you kiss just like my dad.  Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home.
"
3,17,Ms. Crabtree,"Which way should we go?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning. 
"
