Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be.
"Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?"
"That's right. Like all the campers here, you're confused, and you don't think there's a way out. But even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel, the truth is that with the power of Jesus Christ you can be normal. Now, just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy.  Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy.  Ryan thought he could never change. But now he's learning that with the power of Christ and prayer, he can have a whole new life.  Over this way we have the cafeteria. All the meals are served there.  Uh Bradley! How about you be Butters' accountabilibuddy?"
Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
"That's right, Bradley. I think we're well on our way to being healed.  We've got another one: Room 22."
"We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you."
"Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!"
"That's right, kids. You see, right now you're like a paper clip.  And just like a paper clip,  God needs to bend you, and shape you, and make youuuu... straight."
You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?
And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?
Then do you mind telling us why we found this  1979 Sears men's underwear catalog... in your room?
You know this is strictly forbidden!
"What's wrong?!  This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!"
"This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids!  Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!"
Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!
"You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk."
Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?
We're fixing your confusion!
Oheh- hey Dad.
"Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy!"
"Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!"
"Nono, we're fixing you!"
"Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you!"
You get back. You're only gonna make things worse.
Get back! You're just as confused as he is!
He's coming down!  We did it!  Through the power of Christ we have saved this child!
"Aaand cut. Great video shoot, guys."
"Uh oh, looks like we've got a problem."
And you're gonna say that to the boss's face?
Uh we'll just leave you alone.
And. Action!
"Cut, great, print that. Excellent work, Sid. Take five, guys, let's set up for the next shot."
Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent?
"Okay, roll camera, aaand action."
Aaand action.
Hold it! Cut! Could we get some more light on that backdrop?
"Okay. Here we go, aaand action."
Cut!
I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes?
"Well now you won't have to! Ah, here he is. This is Josh Casher. He'll be playing the role of your future son."
"Yes, and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house. And he's worked up quite a future for your son."
"Alright, then we'll put the fake news report out on Tuesday night. Make sure your son is watching the Channel 4 News."
Motivation Corp. takes care of everything.  Just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives.
"So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding."
"Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking."
"So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism.  Or that... one pill of Ecstasy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means."
"Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!"
