Uhhhhh.
Shoot me.
I wish I were dead
"I'm not being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old."
"Uhhhhh  Ah, dammit!  How would you like to make a dollar Billy?"
"Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?"
Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.
Why not?
I killed my grampa when I was your age.
What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own gramparents.
Ingrate!
You pompous son of a whore!
Uhhhh
"Billy, help grampa stick this fork in the outlet."
"Kill me, God dammit!"
"Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?"
"Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch."
That's right.
"And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too."
"Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma."
That's the spirit Tubby.
"I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?"
"Billy, would you mind holding this for grampa please?"
"Tug - a - little harder, Billy."
"Uh, ow."
Dammit! I was so close.
"Come here Billy, I want to show you something."
"Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me  is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grampa."
"Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready Billy?"
Not just yet.
"That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grampa."
So now will you kill me Billy?
"That's good Billy, a little higher now."
Does the pope crap in the woods?
"Uhh, cut the damn rope already!"
"It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.  Come on, let's go.  What the...?"
Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
Come over here you son of a whore!
"Hey, you were supposed to kill me!"
"That's not fair, Goddammit! My grampa asked me to kill him and I did it."
Grampa?
"My name's not Billy, grampa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?"
Limbo?
But I've been waiting for 25 years.
I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?
"No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show."
Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes.
I won! I won!
