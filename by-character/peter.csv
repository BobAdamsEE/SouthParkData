"Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to  keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down."
"Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis"
"Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series  Its emissions are actually cleaner."
"Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco.  Ahhhm.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here."
You think that's bad? Remember when I auditioned to be David Hasselhoff's car?
"Hey there, Knight Rider."
Nervous? Like when I had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain?
"Pancakes for you, Captain?"
Love will keep us together
"Well, maybe we can just have tea."
"Come on, Mohammad, let's get some tea."
"Oh boy, was that ever weird. Anyway, I can't believe I invited my old sweetheart to dinner. Huh."
"Hey Brian, this is like the time I got a job as a carrot cake."
You think that's bad? Remember the time I won a date to Mexico with Gary Coleman?
You think that's bad? Remember the time I got a salmon helmet from Mohammad while wearing a toga?
Coming Mohammad.
"Wow, a salmon helmet! Thanks!"
"Anyway, what were we talking about?"
"Oh yeah, my pink slip."
Or the time I-
This is Peter with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
I have a police car on their way with blankets and cocoa.
My report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television. Fellow students: there is a plague of smut on our cable boxes!  Shows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicide!  I'm talking of course about  murder porn!
"According to the Nielsen ratings, viewership in shows like ""Cold Case Files,"" ""Dateline: Murder,"" and ""Deadly Affairs"" is skyrocketing amongst married couples. The increased viewership has brought about a whole new slew of shows that use graphic sex, and innuendo, to make spousal murder more titillating. Shows like ""Southern Fried Homicide,"" ""Sinful Secrets,"" ""On The Case with Paula Zahn."" And it's all smut and it's garbage and it's  trash!  Your parents are watching this stuff! Go home and ask them! And as we ask them we must also ask ourselves, ""If they're obsessed with this stuff, then how long? How long before one of our daddies dresses up in lingerie and bashes Mommy's head in with a brick?"" "
"We like ya, Eric. You are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea."
Eric kicks ass!
"Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart and true. Everybody likes you very much."
"No, shit, I feel like shit. I think I-"
"Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven, Kenny. I am Peter."
"There isn't much time, Kenny. You're dead, but, your death was no accident. Heaven needs you."
"Come! There is much to discuss.  Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan is planning a massive attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him! God has changed the rules here. For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven.  But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command."
"The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe."
He beat Satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations.
Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo!
Kenny! Bless your soul! You've saved all of Heaven!
