This is an R-rated movie.
"But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in to see it."
"Pretty brutal, isn't it? Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?"
Huh?
I can't refund your money. You sat through the whole movie.
"That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for your sins!"
I'm not allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie! You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.
Yeah. I'd like to see you try.
"Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!"
We sure do!
Woah! Great idea!
"Ooo, Aramaic. Cool."
Can I help you?
They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.
That's... Mel Gibson?
Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times. We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
