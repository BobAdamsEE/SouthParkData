What? What happened?
"Huh?  Oh, all right.  Make way for Santa!"
"Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home."
"Sorry, boys. I tried."
Holy crap!
"That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence."
Howdy-ho ho ho!
"Hello, everybody!"
"You know, Jesus, there've been so many songs written about us over the years."
And heaven and nature sing...
And heaven and nature sing...
"You know, Jesus, that is a nice song, but I like... this one:
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old... me. 
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys"
"Up on the housetop, click click click.
Down through the chimney with good old... me."
Go away??
Where away?
"Here's one, Jol-"
"Hey, it's my turn."
Uh.
Santa Cl- em
Saint Nicholas... can't think of one.
"Okay, Jesus. Here's one you might remember:
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twistin' through the dusty land."
"I know, but there's, like, three-hundred Jesus Christmas songs and only four fucking Santa ones! It's not fair! Just do it yourself! I'm leaving."
"Aw, fuck you, Jesus!"
Aw.
"Well, since I've no place to go."
But I brought some corn for poopity-poppin'.
"And, my dear, we're still good-bop-be-byein',"
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand!
I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.
Christmas is for giving!
Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas!
"Mr. Hankey, how are you?"
I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.
"Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end."
You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.
Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run!
And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.
"Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone!  Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all!"
Merry Christmas!  I'm hit! I'm hit!
Hold on!  Sleigh is going down!
North Pole. This is Santa.
"Sleigh is down. Reindeer... all dead. Both Santa's legs are broken. Santa's... very sad. Santa will have to... oh no. They're coming for me!  Stay back, you bastards! Stay back!"
Where are you taking me??  You are all being very naughty.
To bring happiness and joy to the children.
"No, your country has just lost all its Christmas spirit.  What's going on here?!"
"I don't know, I live in the North Pole.  What are you doing??"
Oh no. Not Santa's balls!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
"Then we're in for a long night, 'cause I don't know shit!"
Jesus Christ!
"Oh! Thank! Thank God for you, Jesus!"
Santa's legs are broken.
I just couldn't do it.  I just couldn't let him live. He shocked Santa's balls!
"No!  Jesus. Jesus!  No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch."
"We sure did, Jesus."
"I'm here, Jesus."
"Come on, kids!"
Get to the sleigh! Get to the sleigh!
"You're right, kid."
I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and by God I'm gonna do it!
Hohoho! Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas! Hohoho!
"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!"
Ho ho ho!
"Everyone! Everyone, can I please have your attention?  Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day. we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus."
"Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do."
"Oh, and boys, you might want to check under the Christmas tree.  Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!"
"All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!"
"Little boy, you should be ashamed!"
"Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters!"
"Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into."
"Don't do it, Kyle!"
"I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you!"
"We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul."
What?
"Well little boy, it seems that you  have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?"
