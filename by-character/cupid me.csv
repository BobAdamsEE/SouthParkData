"We did it, Eric. We found in each other a ray of sunshine."
Teeheeheehee.
"Teehee, that was us, remember, Eric?"
"Teeheeheehee, heeheehee."
Sorry.
Heeheeheeheeheehee.
They're fudgey charms of sunshine.
"Teeheeheehee, teeheeheeheehee."
"Heeheehee, no!"
Teeheehee. Looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine.
"No, you don't."
"No, you don't."
"Teehee, stop it."
"Heeheehee, heeheeheehee,  Heeheeheeheeheeheeheehee."
"Teeheehee, a place for everything, and everything in its place."
"That's right, and I found somebody who's just the same as you!"
There she is!
"Teeheeheeheehee, fuck you!"
