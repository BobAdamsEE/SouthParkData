"Hello, my name is Emir Hadi. My boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar."
"Well, we want to assure you that when this place becomes another Club Persh, you will all still be 100% welcome. All they want is to make the place really nice. We're going to put down some lovely blue carpet, and gold curtain rods."
But you are still welcome to come. My boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way.
Well... we would allow whoev-
"Look uhh, we don't have to offer you anything, so... I don't know why you're being so difficult. This is crazy."
Ohhhhh!
