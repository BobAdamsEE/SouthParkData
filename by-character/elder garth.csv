We're new.
"Oh, enough already. What has Moses ever done for us?"
"Not mine. Tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the New Time, heh. We should use it to pray to Haman and enter into a new millennium faith, and it--"
"All you ever do is worship Moses, but it says in the Book of Centuries that Haman will one day lead the Jews."
"If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?!"
"Fine!  Jewbilee is the time of Haman! You will all see how wrong you are, very soon! When Haman returns from the Ninth Tower of Disillusionment, and smotes Moses and all his followers into pillars of dust that would cry for their petty lives but can't, having recently been turned into dust and all, you will see! You will see this very night!"
"Stupid assholes. Moses ain't gonna teach them anything!  Do not fear, Haman. This night shall be yours, and the anti-Semitic Jews will once again rule the Earth."
"""And it was foretold that the spirit of Moses would finally rest when his spirit was imprisoned by Haman in a conch shell of blind faith."" Conch shell, like this one, hnee."
Infatu camdavid. David hakum ba'ikan shtud!
Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht!
"Enter the conch shell, Moses!"
"And there you shall stay, trapped for all eternity!"
"I told you, the meteor shower is the time of Haman! I am running Jewbilee now!"
I don't think so.
"Now... All of you into that building, or I shoot you where you stand!"
"Move!  Now! Now, Haman, your time has come!"
And the Ancient One looked upon Haman as the new leader of the people!  And it was the night that stars flew around the sky!  Yes! Yess!!
Let the New Tide turn! Let Haman rule his people once again!
"We await your return, Haman!  Your passage is safe from the enemies!"
Don't move!
"It's the summoning of Haman, fool! The awakening of a new kingdom, heeheh!"
Moses is trapped for all eternity in the conch of blind faith!
Enough of this waste of time!  Haman! The Great Summoning is done! Upon these words let your spirit come! Einich! Hos!
Zayak. Kareem!
"Hey, give that back!"
Give me that book!
Haman will deal with you!
Ramek shtud!
Yes! Yes!
"Haman! It's me, Garth! I freed you!"
"Nooo! Eheh. Nooo!  Moses. Uh I, I apologize for any inconvenience, eheh. Uh yuh you see, I was just uh--"
No! Aaagghhh! Ooww..!
