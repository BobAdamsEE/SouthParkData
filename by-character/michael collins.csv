"Boys, in recognition for over one million records sold, the Christian Recording Industry is please to present you with this Myrrh album."
"Nono, in Christian rock, our albums go gold and frankincense and myrrh. Congratulations!"
"No, but you can go double myrrh."
"Oh, please don't take the Lord's Name in vain."
But you spread the Word of the Lord. You've brought faith in Jesus.
