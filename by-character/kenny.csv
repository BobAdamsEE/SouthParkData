(Ow.)
(Hey cool! Check it out!)
(Yeahhh!)
(Okay.)
(What?)  (Where'd she go?)
(You fucking asshole!)
(What the fuck did you do that for?)
"(Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)"
"(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)"
(I almost... touched them.)
(Hey! What the hell are you doing?!)
(What?! No! What are you doing?!)  (You fuckers!)

"(God damn it, someone help me!)"
(Damn.)
"(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)"
('Cause girls like shaved balls.)
(Yes they do.)
(Well I don't know.)
(Woohoo!)
"(Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)"

(Huh?)
"(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!)"
"(Hey, Tammy!)"
"(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)"
(Yep. I like the food!)
(Jonas Brothers?)
(Thanks.)
"(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)"
"(Of course, dude!)"
(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
"(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)"
"(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)"
(Cool!)
"(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)"
(Yep! Woo-hoo!)
"(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!)"
"(Look, they're nothing, but...)"
(Hey!)
"(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)"
(A purity ring.)
"(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)"
(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...)
(Look at this. More DVDs.)
"(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)"
(Yeah...)

"(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)"
"(Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)"
"(Dude, fuck you!)"
(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
(No you fucking don't!)

(No fucking way!)
(Fuck this!)
"(Aww, come on!)"
"(Aw come on, fuck you!)"
(Stop this car!)

(No!)
(Oh fuck I'm gettin' out of here!)
(I don't really know!)
(Yeah.)
"(Yeah, that's true.)"
"(Go, dude!)"
(Woohoo!)
(Hmmm. What the fuck?)
"(Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!)"
(What the fuck are you doing here?!)
"(I'll be there, Karen.)"
(This is Eric Cartman.)
(Uh huh.)
"(Thanks, Stan.)"
(Good for me.)
(AAAAHH!)
"(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)"
(Fuck yeah!)
(Totally!)
"(Yeah, dude!)"
"(Oh, fuck it, dude.)"
(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)
"(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)"
"(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)"
"(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)"
(This is Tango. I have the goods.)
"(Me, too.)"
(What?!)
"(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)"
"(Dude, it's just a fever blister!)"
(I can't take it!)
I don't know. I really don't give a shit.
Beavers!
"Hey.  Fuck you, Cartman."
"(Yeah, what's her name?)"
(I'm not his best friend.)
"(Butters, come on.)"
"(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)"
"(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)"
(Me?)
"(Okay, okay! I'll go.)"
"My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow."
"To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth."
(What about me?)
"(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)"
(Whoops!)
"My dear friends of the mainland,
What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors."
"The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace."
"With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again."
(You do?)
(Yeah.)
"What's going on, Kyle?"
"Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side."
"Dude, fuck this. Let's bail!"
Yes. We saw their faces.
"Yeah, Stan?"
(I told you it was a bad idea.)
(At Red Lobster.)
(Red Lobster!)
(Red Lobster!)
(I knew you're up to something!)
"(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)"
(Huh? Like what?)
"(That's okay, Kyle.)"
(She's not here right now.)
(What do you mean?)
"(Yes. What's up, my lord?)"
(But Stan and Kyle are best friends)
(Yes. That's right.) 
"(Yes, I believe we do.)"
"Previously, on South Park."
"(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)"
"(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)"
"(What?!)  (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)"
(Wooo!)

"(How big's your penis, Chef?)"
(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)
(Oh no!)
(Maybe she'll suck my dick)
"(Hey, what's that?)"
(A little like a vagina.)
(Thanks.)
"(Nope, I'm okay.)  (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)  (Ugh.)"
"(Hey guys, come here.)"
"(Oh, no!)"
"(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)"
"(No, check his penis)"
(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
"(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)"
Mmmmmm!
(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)
"(""And I want to see you handling your breasts."")"
(A big mutant Stan?!)
(Look at that!  What's he doin'?)
(I have to go pee.)

(Ow!)
"(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)"
"(Heeeeyyyy, kick ass)  (Ow!)"
(Woohoo!)
"(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)"
