Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?
But they can't dress like that. That's our style.
"You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!"
"You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids."
"Get out of our space, you little twerps!"
It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.
"I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire."
Do I care?
"If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth."
He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.
Leave us alone!
Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village In from us too.
"Get away, douchebag."
"Well, I think we all know what has to be done."
"Go away Mom, I hate you."
"Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!"
"Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them."
"It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension."
"Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world."
The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal.
"Get out of my room, TWERP!"
"So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more."
"That's how I feel, when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, to she can't hurt me anymore. "
"Shut up, Mom! Go away!"
Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!
"God, she just never stops!"
What?!
"Shut up, Mom!"
Are we really doing this again?!
What?!
I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!
Noo...
I'm not going to any fucking camp!
I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!
Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this!  This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here! 
Hey guys. 
What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me. 
"I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all die."
Not now Mom! I'm suicidal!
"Oh, hey. "
What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.
"That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?"
You should probably stop digging for answers.
There's no winning this for you.  Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.
Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.
"Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth?  Join us!"
Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?
Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in. 
"Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?!  I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted! "
"So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?"
"Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily."
Oh my Gawd.  This is so... em-barrassing.
"Oh.  Oh!  Ihihit's meee-e! I'm, I'm I'm me again!  Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks you guys."
"Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!"
What's Betamax?
My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.
"Shallow life.
Drowning alone, I gasp for air.
Coldness creeps over pale skin.
There is sadness so deep it pulls me down
Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea."
Whoa.
"Make it ""I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades."""
Go away Mom! Leave me alone!
"You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face."
Conformist bitch.
For sure.
Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?
Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.
Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.
