"And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and women's are protected under civil-rights laws,  we want the same!"
"What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a-  Can we... help you?"
You... do?
"Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus."
"Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child."
"Yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends."
"Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready."
"Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us."
"First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys."
"Now, I know that many of us have already found partners in this fahine city, and I'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members."
"Ho, goodness! What a gift from God! Aha ha, we'll... ""get"" ...to it very soon, I assure you. But first, I'd just like to hear from a couple of you on your progress. Uh yes, Patrick."
"Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you, Mr. Harris?"
"Wuhell, members, I know we're all eager to get acquainted with our new partners and, so why don't we turn down the lights and start to dance!"
"Alright, members, that's enough of that.  It's time for all of us to retire to our respective rooms, and get to know our new young boys."
"Everyone come up and grab your room keys and we'll head upstairs, hm hm."
It's clear. The cops are gone. Where's the boys?!
Maybe the boys are in here. Oh bo-oys?
"Oh, one of the boys just came in."
"Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today.  Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called ""freedom."" They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live.  You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand."
"We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away."
