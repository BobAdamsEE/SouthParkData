"Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us?"
"Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it."
"Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play ""Magic: the Gathering,"" and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?"
"Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong. And anyone I find involved with this filth is going down!"
Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that?
"Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?"
"Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?"
Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!
Agreed! Who first called 911?
"Freeze!  Well, well! Looks like I finally caught the big boys! You're all going to jail for a long time!  Especially you, scumbag!"
"We saw your fliers.  ""Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm."""
I'll volunteer.
"I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police."
"Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?"
You're Lorde.
"What is it, Adams?"
Did you choke him?
Did you shoot him?
So what's the problem?
Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black??
"He's not a Native American, damnit! That's obvious!"
That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy!
"As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay."
"Okay, okay, so we're agreeing the hologram is black. So the question is, if he's black, then how come we couldn't choke him?"
"Heh, uh huh? "
"Yeah? Wait. Mitchell, listen to this one.  Start over: what's the setup?"
"Oh, it's a new one.  Aw, shit! Look out! "
Shoot him!
"All right, listen up! We believe this is where the black people are! They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them, so stand by till we figure out what the hell to do!"
"We know we can't, but we're trying to! Jesus, tell them we're workiing on it!"
What?! We're not racists.
"Uh huh, go ahead."
"Yehah? Hang on! Mitch!  Two black guys in the upstairs of the house. One of them is threatening the other one.  Okay, go ahead."
"Okay! Okay, okay okay okay. Go ahead."
"Okay! Okay. Okay. Hold on.  Okay, go ahead."
Oh God! Stop! Stop! Stop!
