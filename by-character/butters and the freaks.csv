"Look for the True Freak label
When you are watching a TV talk show
Remember somewhere,
our union's growing
Our wages going to feed the kids.
And run the house-
We work hard, but who's complaining?
With TFU we're making our way!
So always look for the True Freak label,
Because you need us right here in the U.S.A.!"
