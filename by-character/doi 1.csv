"Fine, just fine."
Mm-it's amazing.
"Mayor, this is a jakovasaur. A live one has never been seen."
Do you realize what this means? We could use its DNA and have a chance of bringing the entire jakovasaur species back from extinction.
Now we must find a safe place for it.
"Well, that sounds fine, just fine."
"Thank you, Mayor.  The noble jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction. And now, you, as a community, have a chance to bring them back."
"...Hope and Jakov are the last of their kind. But with the help of the Mayor, we have implemented a plan to help them breed. We will give them a home and a fighting chance at survival."
"Well, Jakov, we hope this new home ""inspires"" you and Hope to uh, hm, you know..."
"Jakov, to have sex, all you need to do is, well, you know, put your...  Hmmm.  I guess we don't know exactly how jakovasaurs mate."
Amazing! The gestation period was only four days.
"Don't worry, Hope. Everything's gonna be fine, just fine."
Wow! That would be a great start for them.
"Well. Ap-parently, they breed in litters."
Huh?!  Whoa-o-whoa!
"Don't worry, We've come up with a plan."
Yes. We're leaving.
We're getting the hell out of here and away from those God-damned things.
