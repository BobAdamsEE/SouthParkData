"Wha' are you doin' 'ere, you little whippersham!"
Wha' are you doin' wit' those?
Here. W-why are you easy to help me?
"Allo, Pip. You remember me?"
I'll rip off your arms and shove 'em up your arse!
"Yes. After you helped me I moved to Wales and made somethin' o' myself. If it weren't for you, I'd have never become a millionaire."
Because back then you treated me like any other person. You're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man.
"Get out of that chair, you old cow!"
