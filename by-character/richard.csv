"Oh, hey Gerald. New car?"
Well... Good for you.
If only the rest of the country  was as insightful as we are.
So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.
Who else could it have been?
"Loving you
is easy cause you're beautiful
-doo-n-doo--doo-doooo--
Aaaaa! 
Aaaaa!"
Aaaaa!
Lalalalala...
"You guys, you guys! I can do it."
"Loving you
is easy cause you're beautiful
doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-dooo"
Aaah
"How was school today, son?"
That's great.
"Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met.  You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive."
"Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight."
"Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something."
Richarrrrd!
'Oodleahah.
"Tweek, calm down. Have some coffee."
"We can let them go, can we?"
"Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; your son's dead. But those of us with alive children need to be sure that Father Maxi's on the up-and-up."
"Uh, Sh-sh. Here he comes, here he comes."
That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too.
"You too, Tweek!"
Atheism has definitely made our lives better.
"Oh thanks, Sharon."
"That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don't want him saying ""under God"" every day at school. That could really damage him. ""Under God"" should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse me.  Moowwaaagh.  ""Under God"" should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance."
"Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it on TV!"
...What was that last bit?
Tweek!
"Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center."
"Sit down and have some coffee, son.  Tweek, there's starting to be a lot of reports in the news about kids being abducted, and we thought we should talk."
"Now, we don't want to alarm you, son, but we've installed new locks on your bedroom windows and door. Important for you to know never to unlock them at night for anyone except your mother and I."
"You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and I?"
"He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods.  You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest."
"Did he hurt you, son?"
"That's... not a bad idea, a city wall."
"Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there and we're gonna give 'em hell!"
"Well, we've... put a wall around the city to keep outsiders out. You don't think we want a bunch of strangers coming in to play ball, do you?"
"Guys! Sh, quiet everyone."
"Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now."
"'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here."
"Well, maybe things could be better if we could trust people like the Stotches!"
Oh yeah?!
"Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey!"
Where are you going?
Oh?  I think I'll go with you.
I just want to make sure that you-
Me? I would never abduct our son!
"Well what are we supposed to do, eh-? How can we protect Tweek from ourselves?"
Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are... our children.
"Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are."
They're starting to remember.
"We're sorry, Tweek!"
"Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along."
"The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did."
Get out of here!
"How about some shirazz, guys?"
"My pleasure, silly-buns."
Why?
"Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight."
Oh my God!
"Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad."
