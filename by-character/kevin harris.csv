"Well, come on in.  How about a little history first?  Native Americans were the first to cultivate the tobacco plant. They smoked it in pipes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
Excuse me?
The first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in Virginia in 1612.  Within seven years it was one of the country's largest exports.
That's right. Over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from Africa to help work the fields.
"And so for centuries, tobacco production flourished. Nobody was even aware of any dangers back then, until, in 1965,  when Congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon General's warning on their packages. So now, everyone knows the dangers of smoking. And some people still choose to do it, and we believe that's what being an American is all about."
And here's our factory at work.
"Well, I guess that's the end of our tour."
What??
Oh my God!
We will not!
