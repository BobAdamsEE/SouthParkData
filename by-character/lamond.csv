"Excuse me, I am Lamond, the animal trainer."
"Ap ap! Do not call them tricks! She's a very sensitive turkey! She performs feats, not tricks. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the most beautiful bird in America!  Four-time prize winner of the National Western Stock Show and reigning poster child of turkeylovers.com! I give you Alinicia!"
Of course she is!
What... is... that?!
My turkey does not work with other turkeys!
"Alright, ah ah alright! Alri- ah a-alright. Alright."
She's not coming out. She's very upset! She's pooped all over the room!
Kill the other turkey!
"Well, it could meet with ""an unfortunate accident."""
"It's very simple! Either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident, or you don't have a feat-performing turkey for your Helen Keller Thanksgiving musical!"
Little boy.
"Yes, Tim. I feel I must speak with you.  The others, well, they don't want you to know, but, oh, I don't know what to do. Should I tell you?"
I feel I'm the only one who can be honest with you.  The animal shelter is on its way to...take your turkey away from you.
"You see, they don't allow children in your... situation... to have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They... have to take it away."
"They take wild pets away from people like you... and hand them over for experiments. And they're shocked, dissected, and flayed while they're still alive. And no matter where you go, the shelter people will find you. The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go. Back into the wild.  Oh no! Here they come now!  Quick, go! And set your turkey free! I'll try to stall them."
"Uh, the stage is right through there."
The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go...  let him go... let him go...
"You're going to be brilliant, you sexy, gorgeous turkey. With that other meddling animal out of the way, you'll steal the show!"
She's brilliant! Everyone loves her so far.
"Oh, heh. Look, Tim, all is well in love and theatre, right? Haha."
"Here it comes, angel! Your big finale! The audience is going to go wild!  Oh. Back already? Don't worry. Maynard covered your part flawlessly."
"Alinicia! Jesus, no!"
