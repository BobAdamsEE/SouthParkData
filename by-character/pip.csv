Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits.  Haaah!
"Uh, Mr. Chef sir?"
"Well, I still don't have a helmet."
"Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?"
Oh.
Aaaaaaaargh!
"Uh, Mr. Chef sir?"
"Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?"
"No um, I guess not."
"Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?"
"Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one."
"'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?  Lunchy munchies, hmmm?"
"Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongueâ€¦"
Righto.
Eho!
Piiink eye!
Aaah!
"Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one."
"Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation."
"Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me."
Right-o.
"Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday."
Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely.
Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
"Good day, Damien. How are you?"
Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.
"Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there."
"Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me."
"Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-"
Aaaa!  Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee!
"Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty."
Oh! Oh I think I found one!
Oh. I do believe I found it first.
Oh dear.
What do you mean?
"Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must."
"Well-uh I, I guess you win."
"Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball."
"Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--"
"Oh, dear."
"Oh, what jolly good fun!"
"Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't."
I'm not French--
Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!
I'd love to!
"Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.  And besides, I hate French people."
"Oh, bother."
Gagghh!
Gaagghh!
Arrggghhh!
"Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day!"
Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--
Where did everybody go?
"Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!"
"Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?"
"Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead."
I won!
"Cheerio, Stahan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here."
We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
"I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams  We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, ""Turrah!"" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar?  And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la."
"Wickersham tally-ho ugh.  Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?"
"Hey, look at this!"
It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.
"Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?"
"Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed.  Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?"
Well.  Alrighty then.
"Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?"
"Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission."
"Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?"
"Oh, that's a splendid mission!"
Bosley! Bosley!
Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
"Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs."
"So Bosley, what's our next mission?"
"We did it! Great job, Angels!"
"What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?"
"Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?"
Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.
"Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits."
"Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission."
But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
Now what do we do?
I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire.
I think that's got it.
Did I do a nice job? Really?
"O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day!"
"There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job."
"But, if I say that, you'll hit me."
"Please, hit me."
Ooowww!
"Oh, my goodness!"
"Oh, that's a wonderful idea."
This is a sad day for men everywhere.
"Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass!  Oh-ff."
"'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again.  Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together.  But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon.  Wa-a-ah!"
"Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison?  Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you."
I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  There you are.  And here's a sandwich. You must be starving!
"Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.  Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid."
"Waaah!  Lovely day, isn't it?"
Where?
That's a lot of  money-loney.
...I've come to answer the want ad.
What??
"Eho. After you, miss."
"I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am."
"Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days."
Um.
Righty-o. What are we going to play?
"Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time!  Who will go first?"
"Well, uh... I think she's very pretty."
I think she's rather insulting.
Don't you wanna play anymore?
"Oho. Well, yes, miss."
"Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!"
"Oh, dear."
Who is that?
Oh I... rather thought I was.
"Yes. I see.  Hoh, lovely."
"Joe, do you know anything about girls?"
"But, do you know anything about them? About how they work."
Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?
"I'm Pip, sir."
Oho. But it must be Ms. Havisham!
Yes sir.
"Good-bye, sir."
"None, sir."
"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."
Mr. Pocket?
Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar
"My, how lovely."
"Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!"
"Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed."
"Well, what do you mean?"
"Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?"
"Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry!"
Sorry! Sorry!
Oh. Excuse me.
"At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house."
"Terribly sorry, Pocket."
"Good evening, Ms. Havisham."
Thanks to you.
"Oh, my! She is even prettier than before."
"I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day."
Righto.
"Yes, but... where will I find her?"
"Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything!  I'm the happiest boy in the land!"
"Hello, Estella."
Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I?
"Well, I was sent to be schooled in London."
"Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all."
"It is wonderful to see you again, Estella."
Because I believe I'm in love with you.
I think you do.
"I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind."
Who...? Who is that?
"I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?"
Boyfriend??
I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!
Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a-
Ms. Havisham! But um...
But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.
"...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt."
It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly.
But why do you make your daughter hurt people?
Joe?
"Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?"
"Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago."
You? But why?
"Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it."
"Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone."
And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.
"If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!"
"Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch."
You won't get away with this!
"Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!"
"Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this."
"Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart."
But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny.
You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But look at this bunny.  There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.  ...Right.
Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to-  Ten baby bunnies!
Twenty-six baby bunnies
What?
There! You see?! You do have a heart!
"No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now!"
"You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!"
They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.
Really? I don't believe it.
"Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?"
"Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then."
