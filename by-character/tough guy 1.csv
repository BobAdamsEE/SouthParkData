Ey! Look at the little Eskimos in their freakin' hats and gloves.
"Whoa, look at this kid's coat.  Ey, kid. What's the matterâ€”you a freakin' burn victim or somethin'? What?"
I didn't know they was invitin' rednecks to this event!
"Oh yeah? Well, you look like a bunch of queefs to me, huh?!"
"Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!"
Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!
"Yeah see ya later, queefs!"
"Well hel-lo there, queefs. All bundled up nice and warm, are we?"
Of course we know what mung means!
You guys are even stupider than I thought! Mung is so a word!
Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach.
"You guys didn't know that?  Come on, guys. Let's get away from these rednecks before we get redneckasitis, or somethin'!"
Here they are!
Ey! Not so fast! We know it was you guys that changed the music and made everyone on Earth crap their pants!
"Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool."
"Sure. I mean, everyone on Earth shit themselves 'cause of you. And that's pretty cool. I mean, that's pretty amazing!"
Yeah. See you guys later.
