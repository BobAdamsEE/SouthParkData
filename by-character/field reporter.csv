"For the first time in American history, a word has been officially banned from use."
"Tom, it appears that the nigger guy epidemic is ove-  Oh dammit I said it, didn't I?"
"Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again."
"This is our last chance. With nowhere else to turn, the government is going to allow one brave nine-year-old boy  to attempt his method to get the Internet running again.  It all comes down to this. Can the little Jewish boy reason with the Internet? Or will it be gone forever?"
"And what is your name, little boy?"
"Alright Martin, can you do me a favor? Could you point to the ""fag"" for me?  Point to which one is the fag.  All right now could you just point to the fag for me, little girl? Which one is a faggot?"
How do you fags feel about the new city ordinance?
"Just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance, fag."
I already did it twice.
I bet I do.
Fag.
"Excitement is in the air as the citizens of South Park amass to see if the word ""fag"" will officially be changed in the English dictionary. Four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor, and if they succeed, ""fag"" will officially refer to Harley riders nationwide."
"And Tom, it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived.  Entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course, the dictionary's head editor, Mr. Emmanuel Lewis."
"Breaking news from acclaimed author Leopold Stotch. The artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller. We got a statement from the writer, who is still grounded in his room."
Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?
Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book?
"A terrific human interest story here, Tom. As America wonders what happened to Captain Hindsight, some Colorado kids are being a little ""superhuman"" themselves. They call themselves ""Coon and Friends,"" and they've been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the Gulf crisis."
"Their little ""super club"" consists of seven young heroes."
"The boys stated that there used to also be a hero named The Coon actually in the group, but they let him go because he was being quote,  ""a dick""."
"Breaking news here in the Gulf, Tom. The dark ancient god Cthulhu has called for a press conference, The Old One told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news."
"Tom, it's a big exciting day for Mac Apple users: the unveiling of the first HumancentiPad. As part of a clear PR stunt, Apple has joined up with Best Buy and Dr. Phil to donate the first centiPad to a needy boy who was raped by his mother."
"Tom, you should have seen the looks on people's faces as Funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vagina-obsessed Hispanics to Sandra Bullock, then spontaneously started shhhooting people  in their faces and in their chests. The blood went flying and oh shit it was funny."
"Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. They call themselves the pissed-off and angry party. And they allowed me to speak with them moments ago."
What exactly are you angry about?
You've got a lot of people scared. What are your demands?
Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the Federal Government?
"Tom, a brand new sushi place has opened in South Park, adding to our booming Asian district. With the addition of the new Chinese restaurant, townspeople are officially naming this whole Chinatown area ""Little Tokyo."""
"Tom, I'm standing in the heart of South Park's Little Tokyo, where the multitude of our town's Chinese are putting on a festival. Both of them have gone all out to celebrate Asian culture. The owner of Shitty Wok has actually paid for what he calls ""a tower of peace.""  to symbolize harmony between the two restaurants"
The musical came to a screeching halt as patrons flooded out the exits and water flooded the theater.  The only fatality was a young boy who could not get out of the theater in time. The fire chief said it was unfortunate the child was not wearing a life preserver.
"Are we good? We live? Tom, I'm here at South Park Elementary, where officials have barged their way in after reports of Stan Marsh of the Stanground Foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet. Rumors have surfaced that Stan did not stan his ground as previously stated, and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together."
"Jesus, some people might be thinking you're doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use?"
"Ah I believe it's Belarus, Jesus."
"Um, so you think you've something here to keep the conflict from escalating, is that right?"
"Uh huh, and now that the Belarusian farmers are all dead, what will you try next?"
"And and you claim that a General Tso hired your friend, Fatass, to steal the ballots, but so far the Chinese are refusing to speak with us."
Is that it? Did he just? Did he just?
"Little boy, the General Tso's chicken joke, a favorite for years, you've just hit the magic number, how does it feel?"
"He's being presented with the check now, a five thousand dollar gift certificate to P.F. Chang's.  This has been a long campaign, but someone's finally done it, Wolf."
"This is Robert Pooner reporting live from Nebraska, where escaped convict Charlie Manson has walled himself up in a house.  We understand that there are hostages, and that the situation is critical, , so we would like to remind you all that this live hostage crisis is being brought to you by Palmoral Sun Block . Remember, if it isn't Palmoral, you're gonna get cancer."
"Tom, I'm standing about two miles outside of Denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death.  Guys, can you tell us what kind of explosive we're actually dealing with here."

"Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say."
The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists.
"Tom, it looks like I have an update: Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make seem important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to ""Puppoies from Around the World."""
"Tom, the calf terrorist standoff continues as now members of the FBI arrive to put an end to the conflict."
"Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom."

But now, that little boy's three closest friends miss their friend so much that they are building a ladder to heaven, in order to-  a ladder to heaven in order to try to see him again.  It's so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's what some people had to say."
"Tom, people from all over the-  Sorry.  People from all over the country are coming to see the ladder, feeling a connection to its symbolism, and beauty. Even country singer Alan Jackson has shown up with a song he has written about the ladder.

And now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions. Let's listen in."
"Tom, it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and caption the nation's hearts. They've made a nation believe heaven might be up there. And it could prove to be a threat to our country. President Bush will seek UN approval for military action."
But... what about your lost friend? What about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven?
"Tom, I'm standing in chilly South Park, Colorado, where the residents are entering the third day of their sit-in to try and stop Native Americans from building a superhighway through their town. The temperature is low, but spirits are pretty low, too."
"Tom, it now looks as if the Native Americans are handing out blankets as a sign of goodwill towards the South Park people. What an incredible display of compassion. I certainly hope there's nothing sinister behind it."
"Tom, it's Tuesday morning now, and the outbreak of SARS in South Park has reached epic proportions.  The entire town has been quarantined by the federal government, nobody allowed in our out, which means, nobody can come to our aid.  It appears this town, and this reporter, are done for.

And ninety-seven percent said, ""Who the hell is MOOP?!"" Back to you, Tom."

"Tom, I'm standing outside of the Department of Motor Vehicles, where senior citizens have until three p.m. to hand over their driver's licenses.

"Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling."
"Tom, I'm currently ten miles outside of Beaverton, unable to get inside the town proper. We do not have any reports of fatalities yet, but we believe that the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions. Beaverton has only a population of about eight thousand, Tom, so this would be quite devastating."

"Oh geez, here we go with the gun again."
Breaking news here in South Park. Tom Cruise and John Travolta still... will not come out of the closet. Park County police have decided to try a new method.
"We've just had an incredible development here, Mitch. Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly, have all come out of the closet!"
"Thanks, Tom, I'm here at the Denver Sea Park where, believe it or not, dozens of people have come to show support for whoever took the whale."

"Tom, I'm standing in the garden of St. Peter's church in Bailey, where what some call a miracle is taking place. The statue of the Virgin Mary has started to bleed. Out its ass.  The phenomenon was first seen by Father Harold Barnes,  who saw the blood coming from the Virgin Mary's ass late last night.  People from all over the state have flocked here to the church to witness the apparent miracle firsthand."
Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood?
"Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood out her ass?  As news of the miracle spreads, hundreds are expected to show up here at the church, hoping to witness the miracle, and even cure their diseases."
"The crowd grows larger every hour, as the statue of the Virgin Mary continues to miraculously cry blood... out her ass. A Cardinal, Mallory, has been sent by the Vatican to determine whether this is a true miracle or not."
An update from the bleeding Virgin Mary statue!
"Earlier today, the new pope, Pope Benedict the 16th himself, visited the statue here in Bailey to witness the miracle firsthand.  It was an amazing sight to behold as Pope Benedict made his way through the throngs of people."
"The pope then examined the statue closely.  After witnessing the phenomenon firsthand, the pope then cleaned himself off and then declared that the bleeding Virgin Mary statue is not a miracle!"
"Having investigated closely, the pope determined that the blood was not coming from the Virgin Mary's ass, but rather, from her vagina. And the pope said quote, ""A chick bleeding out her vagina is no miracle. Chicks bleed out their vagina's all the time.""  Back to you, Tom."
