Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to me in years.
"Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass."
Well that'll never happen.
"Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?"
Ooo. How d'you know?
'Ow do we get proof?
'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with.
He wants to know what information we have.
Stop wastin' my time.
"I didn't say ""stop wastin' my time,"" Geraldo did."
Hallo?
This is Gary.
"A'right, look. All you need to know is that I'm definitely not Oprah's asshole."
"Don't call me a twit, Geraldo!"
The writer of the book on Oprah's Book of the Month Club is a phonih. He's not a person at all. He's a towel.
You'd be surprised at things that can talk.
"Just look into the author of ""A Million Little Fiyabers,"" and you'll discover the truth."
Oprah's got egg all over her face! She'll have to retire!
And her Gary too.
Yeah! They're all right pissed off! This is great!
"I don't understand, Mingie."
"Minge, does this mean I have to wait to see Paris?"
No!
"Mingie, what're you doin'?"
"Mingie, have you lost your mind?"
"Not like this, Mingie. Not like this!"
Jesus Minge! You killed him! You shot him dead!
"Oh God, I think I'm goinna be sick eh."
"I can't, uh... I'm goinna puke!"
"Oh just put down the gun, Mingie. Maybe they'll go easy on us."
"Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared."
Min...  Mingie.
"They got me, Mingie."
"Aye. They got me bad. Oh, the blood."
"Ih... It's gettin' dark, Minge."
I've seen muh life flash before me eyes. Mingie!
"Where... where are we, Mingie? Are we in Paris?"
Ahhh... Is it as wonderful as I 'oped?
"Tell me what you see, Mingie."
"Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie. At least I got to see Paris before I-"
"Great luau, Satan."
Hello everybody. It's relly great to meet you all.
"I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!"
Hey. My name's Gary.
"That's funny. You're cool, man."
Oh! Oh oh oh! Nineteen sixty nine!
Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball around with me?
'Scuse me?
"How come you wanna fight me? ...Oh, I get it. I'm the new kid.  Yeah, I guess maybe I deserve it."
"It's really tough being in a totally new place, but I think all you guys are really cool so... I understand if there's initiation rites."
"The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday."
"Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad."
And this is my brother Mark.
My sister Jenny.
My little brother Dave.
And my baby sister Amanda.
That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that?
"Yeah yeah, yeah, I love my family!
My family is the best!
If we ever have to face a challenge."
can pass the test.
Yeah!
You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.
"Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad."
Awesome! I can't wait!
"You coming, Stan?"
Bye!
Hey Stan.
"Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one.  I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front."
Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along?
Oh here comes my family now!
"Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!"
So what do you guys wanna do?
Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.
"So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great!"
Sure.
"Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon."
Hey everybody.
Hey Stan.
"Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!"
Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!
Hey Stan.
"Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore."
"Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls."
