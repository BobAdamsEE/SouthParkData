Bye-bye!
"Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house."
"Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?!"
"Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!"
"Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know?"
Thanks.
Great speech!
This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!
Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's!
"All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!"
How could Family Guy do that?
"Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute."
So how do we do that?
"Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?"
He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9-11!
The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student
Yeah. I know.
That's us!
Good luck!
"Randy? Randy, what happened?"
No. We can't be.
"What happened, Glen?"
It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!
We're gonna be all right!
"You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever."
How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?
"Come on, Randy, what do you say?!"
Fourteen?!
"Come on, Randy. You have to push!"
"There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot."
"Hey, check it out!"
They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.
"Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls!"
"No, I mean, your actual balls!"
"Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned."
"Heh, I am stoned off my ass!"
I don't know. I guess we'll see.
I don't know.
We have to give in to their demands.
That'll be Tom Cruise...
"Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed."
Protect... the Denver Broncos.
"Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!"
"How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski?"
"Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it!"
"Maybe he really is stupid, Randy."
That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
Who is that?!
"Alright, let's do it."
"How do you tell him? ""Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife."" It's really none of our business."
He's back!
I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!
He casually dropped this on his way out!
"Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!"
Can I help you?
"Alright, you want a rifle!  well, like this .22 caliber.  What is it you intend to shoot?"
...You mean a person who's threatening you?
"Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you."
"You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a ""stand your ground"" law."
"See now with a ""stand your ground"" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not."
"No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a ""stand your ground"" law, like Florida."
So long as they're threatening you.
"Hey everyone, you need to see this!"
What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!
Can I help you?
"Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?"
"Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!  That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes."
"Okay, how about this?"
"Here's the same gun, with a wood finish."
"That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning."
"Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe."
"Oh, ho, that's disgusting."
"That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'."
"Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber."
You what?!?
"Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like … fishing … sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization."
"Well, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes."
"Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer."
"Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear …one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful… By God, it's coming right for us!"
"Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality."
"You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting."
"They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'"
"Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!"
"Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck."
"Let's move, moove!"
This one's yours Stan.  It's coming right for us.
What the? What's wrong with you?
"What the hell are you talking about, you don't want to shoot the bunny? You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical."
No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger.
"Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick."
"Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!!"
"Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?"
"You see… Ned picked up the grenade and… BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day."
"Hah, got ya."
"Hey Ned, hand me that gin.  You boys want to tie one on?"
"What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?  Christ, look at that little bastard go!  Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!"
"Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song."
"What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there!"
Great instincts boy.
Who? The fat kid?
"Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!  Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit."
"Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew."
"Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off."
"Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.  Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast."
"Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!  Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun."
Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
This calls for some HJ-14.
Fire in the hole!
"Damn it, I think I missed"
"C'mon, let's move, move!"
"These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!!  The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe."
Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?
I can't tell; let's kill it!
"Kenny, you take the front."
"That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!"
You pansy! give me that gun.
What in Sam Hell?
"Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that-"
The mountain! It's blown it's top!
That lava's coming right for us!!
What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
"Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!"
"Quick Ned, shoot it!"
"Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed."
"Hey, he's saving us."
"Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!"
"Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?"
"But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?"
"Hey, how's practice coming there Chef?"
I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park Alumni.
That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
Middle Park by 70 points.
Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. Right Stanley?
Thatta boy.
"Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie."
I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
"No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now..."
"Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself."
"Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?"
"'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget."
What we'll have to do here Carl is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.
"Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F."
"You know, Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah"
"No, dammit! The Aaaaah."
Aaaaahh.
"Great, we..."
You got it...
Aaaaahh.
"Come on Ned, and keep quiet."
"Hello there, Enrique."
"Well Ned, we always kidnapped Middle Park's mascot. But this year we're gonna booby-trap it instead.  And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in Loving You, Boom!  No more Middle Park players."
"God damn, I love football!"
"Ned, look.  They've got Enrique on their sideline, and it looks like that bomb's still attached."
Hell's bells.
"Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, hehe."
Alright Richard!
What the hell?!
He didn't sing the high F.
"Ned, we are going to get our asses kicked."
Yeah!!!
"Give 'em hell Stanley!  Jesus, now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?"
Yeah!
Yeah! Woohoo!
What?!
No!
"The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned."
What the hell's going on here?
"Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie!"
"We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince."
Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!
Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.
I wanna change my bet to Satan.
Yeah.
No way! He barely touched him!
Yeah!
"Man, that guy is a jerk."
"Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!  Ih-it's comin' right for us!"
"Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest Goddamned deer I have ever seen!"
"Get around th' side there, Ned. I can't get a shot in from here."
"Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance!"
"Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos!"
Garrison? That's impossible. He's gay.
He's gay!!
"Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean."
Nope. He's gay.
Daaagh!
It's a power outage!
"Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!"
There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
"What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!"
"Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--"
"Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!"
"Well,  we're not going anywhere for a loong time."
I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.  Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive.
"That's a lot of lead, Mr. Director. I don't eat pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it."
"Well, we draw straws."
"Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws."
"Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing.  Whew."
Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
"Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!"
We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts.
"God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight!"
"What time is it, Barbrady?"
"We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again."
"It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who."
"Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there."
"Get outta the way, you damn hippie!"
What?
"Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert?"
"Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab."
"Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in.  Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China."
"Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned."
"Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?  We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call ""Pussy Law #4"", states that we can no longer kill animals in defense.
(""PUSSY LAW #4""
NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED,
EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS
SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS
IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY
BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE
PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE
BODILY HARM.)
In other words, our old line of, ""It's comin' right for us""--"
"--no longer works. So now, we only kill naimals to, quote, ""thin out their numbers"". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die.  Uhh... So roll the tape.  Here we are at Shafer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals."
"Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!  Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!"
"Good work, Ned. Now they won't starve."
That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.
"Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species."
"And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained.  One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist.  Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog.  There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!  Now, freeze it!  Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?"
"Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then...
We're so glad you spent your time with us
While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts
Come again and stay a while
We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed"
"Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley.  So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?"
"Oh. Yeah, we sure were."
"Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun."
"Yepper, that's where me and Ned met."
I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.
"Oh, boy, what a gorgeous day!"
Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.
"Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?"
"Why the hell not? We're at war.  Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat."
I see 'em! Drop the bomb!
"Oh, no!"
Then we only have one option.
"We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards!"
"Aaarrrggghh-- Oh no! Out of ammo!  We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Vietcong Army!"
Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes!
"And that's the way it happened, boys."
Wow!
Holy smokes! We could get an Emmy!
"Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park."
"Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away.  Okay, roll the film, Tom.  Is it over? Okay, it's over.  Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists."
"And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show."
"Well, it appears as though a lot of you ""skeptics"" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer.  Roll it!  There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!"
"Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--"
"--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?"
Anonymous tip?
"Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?"
Yep.
That war was hell on everybody.
Wow! Do we got more money?
Let's hunt!
Hit the deck!
It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.
"Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!  Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you."
"Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today.  The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.  We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device  while Ned will ambush him from the rear.  Now, Ned! He's not looking!  Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!  Ned. Ne-ed?  Oh, no!  Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!  Come back to me, buddy."
"Hold onto your butts.  Take that, you demon frog!  Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?  Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!"
"...""but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'""  Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself.  Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!"
Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!
What..?
You sent in those videos?!
"My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!"
You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.
Uhhhh... Thanks?
"That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.  Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!"
Like what?
Satan. Got it.
"Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!"
Roger.
I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!
"Why, you little piece of crap!"
Hey!
"Bring it on, you bitch!"
"Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened."
"I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different."
"Well, sure. I mean, eh...  Well, no uh, I guess not."
"It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool."
"I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble."
"Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned?"
Yeah. Titties and beer.
The lava's comin' right for us!
"Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!"
"Quick Ned, shoot it!"
"Hey there, boys!"
How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
What?!
"Oh my God!  Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case.  Buckle your seat belt, Ned."
"México, my amigo."
"To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?"
"Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way."
"Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr."
Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr.
"Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone."
"Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July.  We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning."
"Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.  I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?"
"Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland."
"Fire away, we have nothing to hide."
"No, sir."
"Yes.  I mean, no! No!"
Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
"Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again."
Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.
"Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again."
No.
Yes?  Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?  Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
"Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!"
"Buenos gracias, boys."
"Oh, now, why the long faces?"
"Well, I don't think those are problems  that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!"
"Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.  Point 'em away from your eyes, now."
"Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child."
"Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!"
"Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell."
This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!  Which will live forever in South Park from this day forth. Release the curtain!
"Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows!"
"Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.  With that said, let's rock and roll!  Everybody ready to run?  Release the cows!  They're loose!"
Yeehaw!
"All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!  Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked.  Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial!"
"Okay, that's enough o' that! You cows need to dis-perse!  All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!  All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!"
"Holy smokes! Play dead, Ned!"
"You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!"
"Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow!"
Yep.
"They're dead, mayor. They're all dead."
"Oho, it was awful!  Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!"
"I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. Uhud I need a cold beer and a burger.  What's all the ruckus over there?"
"Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!"
"Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?"
"Aw, I forgot all about them."
"Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing."
You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
"Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you."
"Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing."
"Keep your guard up, Tweek!"
"All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here."
"Punch him in the balls, Tweek!!"
"Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down!"
"Good! Now kick his balls!  There, see? You've got him coughing up blood."
Now THAT'S BOXING!
"Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?!  I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!"
"Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out."
What the hell's goin' on?!
"Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on!  Where did it go?"
"Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap!  Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready."
Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
"Well, let's kill it."
Huh?
"Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it."
"Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight."
"Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!"
"Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box!  You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go.  Well, try it out!"
"Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake."
What? What is it?
We just encourage them to find someplace better.
Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed!
"Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express."
Close the door!
The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.
"Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks!"
"""Don't Sue People"" Panda?"
"Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year."
...What??
Where is he?!
"Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here."
Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
"Huwell, uh he's got a point there."
"Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house."
"Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks."
"Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew."
What?!
"Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!"
"You can do it, kid! You can do it!"
"You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks.  Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!"
"Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?"
You what??
"See ya, Cotswolds.  Thanks for stopping by."
"Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow."
"Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
"Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
"Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!"
"Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield.  First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!"
"I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores."
"And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924."
"Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed."
"...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!"
Forward!
Fire!
"Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time."
"Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose."
What??
"By God, he's right!"
"Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!"
And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
"Surrender your men, general!"
"SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!"
The South wins!
"Well, we can all be friends now.  Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps."
"Aw, come on. Have a little sip."
Huh?
They don't?!
You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
"I'll bet we could, too!"
What?!  Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
"All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!"
Let's go!
Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee!
"It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!"
Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick.  Blouach.
Hey! There's some more schnapps over here!
Medic!
"Where to next, General?"
"Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated."
"Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?"
"Um, sure.  What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?"
I guess we drank it all.
"Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had."
"Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick."
We're goin' home kid. Come on.
"Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here."
"Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order."
"Hey, look! Ned's doin' his trick again!"
You heard the General.
Charge!
We got it! The fort is ours!
"What do we do, General? We're outnumbered."
"Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up!"
"Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?!"
"Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei."
Hey! Who's that?!
"Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!"
"All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted."
"Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over."
We thought you did.
We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!
Here he comes!
"Whoa, man."
"Mayor, it's about the South Park flag."
"We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!"
"Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!"
"Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?"
"No, because it's their history!"
And I'm telling you it WON'T!
"This is about history, kids.  If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD!  -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not  ""politically correct."" Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL!  And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?"
You sure?
"You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson!  God-damnit, we missed him again!"
Don't change history!
"Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history."
Don't change history!
"Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them."
"Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with."
"Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?"
Let's say they should change the flag!
I think we should switch sides!
"Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?"
"So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?"
"So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is."
"That worked perfectly, Ned."
"Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts."
"That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy?  Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess.  Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!"
"Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes."
"Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef."
"We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with."
"I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer."
"Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey!  It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas!"
"There it is!  Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot!  Here, turkey turkey."
That's it. Thaaat's it!
Gotcha!
"Aw, thank God you're alright, kid.  It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?"
Turkey shoot!
"Oh, was that it? Was that it?!"
They did it!
"Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say ""fag""."
Uh oh.
"There he is! Kill him! Kill him!  Oh, wait, that's not him."
Kern.
O-kay.
Huh??
"Uh, I don't feel nothin'."
Hhud. I don't feel... hello... wait... wait...
Yes! Oh my God!
Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!
"Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know."
"Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?"
"Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there."
"Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter."
Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
What do you see?
"No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill."
Oo what's a Radiohead?
"Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!"
"Nice thinking, young hunter."
What?
"What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!"
"Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!"
"Here you go.  Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?"
"Well, stop it!"
Oh crap!
"Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!"
"Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash."
On what?
"Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT."
"Uh, that's okay, I'll stand."
"Yep, there goes the neighborhood."
Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.
"I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!"
Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them!
I guess we showed them!
"Lowercase ""t""?"
"Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!"
I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.
...Ghosts?
"But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park."
What?!
Let's get him!
Hey everybody! AIDS is finally funny!
Well that guy's just plain nuts.
You damn kids!
"Well we don't know what else to do, Mayor!"
Play ball!  Steeeeee-riiike
South Park Cows do it again!
"Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh...  What the hell are they doing?"
Awwww.
A ladder tuh... Oh... oh God.
It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is.
Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda.  Light the damn tree!
"Oh, finally!"
You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side o' the town!
Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.
"W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs."
"All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!"
Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!
Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.
It's a long shot.
Let's go thirty one! Let's see it!
We'll never give up! You bastards!
"Mr. Garrison, those are great pants."
"Uh, for what?"
No.
"Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt."
"Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!"
"We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!"
"Whoa, look out!"
"Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God!"
"Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce."
"Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?"
"Man, it is about to get crazy up in here."
All right!
It's like some mystical evil force.
"Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!"
Please. Don't let them ruin our town.
Anything else?
"Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?"
They're in!
Me??
