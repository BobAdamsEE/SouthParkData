"Now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. Something that sets up the entire show."
"Wait! What's that, you say? A thanksgiving turkey is what you require? I know of a turkey."

I will go promptly and call her trainer. On the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey.
