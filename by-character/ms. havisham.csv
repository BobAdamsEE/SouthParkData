Who is that?
Come closer. Look at me.  Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years?
"I sometimes have sick fancies.  And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play."
"Estella, play with this boy."
"But, you can break his heart."
What do you think of her?
Hm-m-m. What else?
"Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall ""play"" some more."
"Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces."
"Come closer, Pip.  My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you?"
Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well.  She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her?
"Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?"
"Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it."
"Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved."
There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!
"And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper.  Lover her."
"Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip."
"Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip?  Look at the way he holds her hand."
"Things aren't always as they seem, Pip.  Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart?"
Yes. Tell me about the pain.  Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things.
"Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe."
Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it.
"Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device.  You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation."
"Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis platform."
"And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you!"
"Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle?"
"Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin."
"Yes. Cry away, males.  Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete."
Won't I?  Let the transformation begin.
It begins.
...Yes...
Yessss!  Noooo!
