Are you the network president?
"We need to discuss this Family Guy episode, Mr. President."
"But Mr. President, this is a matter of national security. They must be reasoned with."
"I want to assure the American people that as President, I have exhausted every possible solution. Unfortunately, Mohammad will appear uncensored on Family Guy tonight at seven."
I have come to... understand something about the Family Guy writing staff. Suffice it to say that they will not be persuaded by the possibility of violence.
I'm afraid that information is classified.
Look! The fact of the matter is the Family Guy writing staff is protected by something called the First Amendment!
"Uh you know, the right to free speech."
Well... We didn't come up with the First Amendment. It was already in place.
"Hey, that wasn't bad at all. They just showed Mohammad standin' there, lookin' normal."
What?!
"Hello, I am the President Bush. I will crap on both of you."
