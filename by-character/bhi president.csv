She's fantiastic. Who is she?
"Yeah, but she's younger and spicier."
"No, you're right. We're gonna have to fire J-Lo."
"Ah, Ms. Lopez, come on in."
"Yes, well uh, Ms. Lopes, we regret to inform you that, uh... we're dropping you from the label."
"Wu-well a very talented younger singer has come to our attention and, and the truth of the matter is her name happens to be Jennifer Lopez as well. And we really can't have two here at BHI Records."
"Whatever. Look, it's nothing persona, we just think you need to move on."
"Gentlemen, we have ourselves a hit."
We'll sue you!
Get her out of here!
You're not?
