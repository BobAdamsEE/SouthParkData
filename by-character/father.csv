"Principal Victoria, we are a devout Catholic family! Do you mind telling me why my daughter now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?!"
I see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits.
Then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of Varnov. Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.
Hold! You cannot yet caress my daughter's awesome boobage!
There is... another suitor.
This must be decided at the Breastriary in Nippopolis!
Now fight for the Loc-Nar trophy!
I don't know.
"'Scuse me, miss?"
These people won't leave us alone.
You aren't Chinese.
"Look, we don't know what you're talking about. There's no Chinese plan to take over America."
There's nothing to sort out! These kids need to be put in jail!
That means... they'll never be free to rape again.
"Not yet, Katie."
That's it girls. No more Disney TV for a while.
That boy too fat to be eating potatoes.
"Good to see you again, son."
Where is our daughter?
Marcy! You're coming home this instant!
You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!
You're just a stupid little fat kid who thinks that--  Aagghh--!
"She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had no choice."
"What? Heh, hello there, kids."
"Oho, gingers, yes. Our cute little red-haired rascals."
"Yes, we've learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families' DNA. Actually, the odds of us having a red-haired freckled child were only one in four. And still it happened. Three times. What are the odds?"
Each one of them's a blessing.
Huh Blesse-blessing full of love.
"No... no, I'm sure they do.  Well it was nice meeting you boys. We've gotta get dinner started."
"Look, boys, if you really don't wanna have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene.  I know a guy who's marrying a Japanese woman very soon for just that reason."
