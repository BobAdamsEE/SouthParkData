"You're overreacting, you stupid Swedish cow!"
"God, shut up!  Shut! Up!  Where are my fucking pills?!"
Will you just listen to me?!
Aaaah!  You fucking whore!
I'm getting the fuck away from you!
"D'Aaaah! Fuck you, cunt!"
"Aw, look what you did, you crazy bitch!"
"Aaagh! Goddamnit, stop it!"
I want to say that I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior. I know that I have severely disappointed all of you. Some have speculated that my wife somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving Night. It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. She has shown nothing but grace and poise-
Oh no!
Agh! Stop it!
"I am so happy that I am cured, and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife. Now I can be faithful. And my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys.  So I officially announce my return to golf."
