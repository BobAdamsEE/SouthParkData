"No, I like it. You seem like a very strong woman."
How come I've never seen you down at the girl bar?
"Oh you'd love it. It's the only bar in town where women like us can hang out and be ourselves. It's called ""Lebow""."

How can you tell?
"Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here. He wants to talk to you and you alone."
"Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now?"
