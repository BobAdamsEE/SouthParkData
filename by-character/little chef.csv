"Ooo, come on, now."
"Hey, man, I don't need dope. Let me sing you a little song:
I can't wait until I grow up
and my weenie get big and strong
'Cause when it does I'm gonna bust
And make love to you Amanda all night long
I'm gonna make love to y'Amanda in about ten years!"
"And that toothpick is gonna turn into an oak tree,..."
"I'ma knock ya down, knock ya up,..."
"...knock ya over, an' knock ya all around."
