"Hello, children."
"Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.  Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,  but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us."
"Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?"
Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.
"Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?"
So you're alright?
"Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?"
"Stan, how about you?"
"Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables.  Cartman?"
"Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?  Well, where did he leave off?"
Can I help you?
Aand?
I'mm the substitute.
"That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished-"
"That was enthralling, Mr. Chef, but...could I get back to teaching now?"
"Fine, Chef.  Just let me do my job before I get fired."
Wwhat?!
"Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do."
"Of course, Wendy."
"Ohhh. Well, I've taken a liking to all of you. You're all so young and cute and full of life..."
"Of course, Wendy."
Wha?
"Well, I certainly want to thank all you lovely children for the presents you got me  Ohhh. What a delightful scarf. Thank you, Kyle."
"And here's one from Kenny.  Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage.  Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan."
"And here's another present...from Wendy.  Oh. Why, it's a dead animal.  Thank you, Wendy ."
"Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now.  But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner."
"Are there any questions before we begin?  Yes, Wendy?"
"Good morning, children."
"Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too!  We're like sisters!"
"All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is-"
Really?
Wel...sure!
"Oh. By the way, kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me...is...Stan."
"I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education."
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
"Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends."
"Well first of all, you're eight."
Oh boy.
"Good morning, children."
"Sure, but...can't it wait until after class, Wendy?"
"Oh, that's okay, Wendy."
"Well, I would love that, Wendy."
"Wendy, there's nothing between me and Stan!"
"Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting."
It's a lie!
Nooo!
"Principal Victoria, please."

NOOOOOOO!!
Egh.  This is all a mistake!  This can't be happening!  Pleease! For the love of God!
