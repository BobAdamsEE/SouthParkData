Then that's it! We brought him back.
Call the parents. They're going to be shocked to find out... their son is alive.
It's the latest in electro-plastilical science. Your son's organs are all functioning again.
"I'm afraid he can't respond to you. You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny's brain cells died from lack of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in what we call a ""persistent vegetative state."""
"I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be repaired once dead. But his soul is still in here.  Almost... trapped in here, if you will. Kenny is the same as he ever was. It's just that, now, he's more like ...a tomato."
A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient paste directly into Kenny's stomach. With it we can actually keep Kenny the tomato alive for years.
"He can't respond to you, boys. Being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain."
But this just doesn't seem right.
I'm afraid I've been given a court order to remove Kenny's feeding tube.
I'm sorry. I have no choice.
