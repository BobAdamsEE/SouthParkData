Indeed!
"What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does!"
"Noo, no, that's the Adventure Club. We're the Super Adventure Club!  Next week, we'll be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe, then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K-2, and molest several Tibetan children on the east summit."
"I know, but it gets even better! From there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you ALL like to join the Super Adventure Club!"
No? Oh really? Perhaps I should ask you again?  How would you like to join the Super Adventure Club?
"Oh well, it doesn't work on everybody.  Well, so long then."
What? What thing? I don't see anything.
"Great shot, William! Hit him with another."
"Tally ho, lads! I must say you're starting to become quite a thorn in my balls."
He's safe.  He's fasting in the Deprivation Room and being read the Super Adventure Club manual. We've got to undo the damage you've done.
"We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life!"
Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club.
"You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas!  Phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers,  but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it.  Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas!  Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal.  But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal."
"He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies.  And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos.  Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892."
Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years?
"Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave."
"If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave.  You'll be let out by security and it will be super-embarrassing and everyone here will see!  Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating?"
"Cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome.  You petulant fools! You just had to push it, didn't you? You don't realize who you're dealing with here. Security!  Take these boys to the door."
Haha! Look they're being led out by security! Haha!
What the-? Impossible! I made them leave!
Stop them!
Stop!
Don't you remember why you left South Park in the first place??
You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty!
"Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL!"
Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all.  NO!
We can't lose another member! Shoot it!
Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester.
Is it working? Is it working?
"Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry!  We have done it! Good! Raise him up!  Chef, can you hear me? Say something."
"Yes, go on."
Oh? You mean like a chocolate candy?
"Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa!"
