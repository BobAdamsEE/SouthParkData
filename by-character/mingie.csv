"Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his!"
"Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!"
"Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?"
"Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation."
She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.
Not unless she gets fired.
"That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel."
"I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions."
We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.
'Allo 'Eraldo. I've got some information for you ya might find interestin'. It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.
"Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah. You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?"
What'd 'e say?
"Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary! Don't wait for me 'o ask you ""wha' 'e say?""!"
"Ay, don't get snooty with me, Gary!"
"Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'. Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk."
Don't give away your name. We don't want anyone to know where we are.
Aw you stupid twit!!
"He didn't call you ""stupid twit,"" I did!! Now just tell 'im this:"
Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk.
"'E did it, Gary! 'Eraldo got the proof!"
"It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary. Without 'er career 'o worry about, Oprah's sure to travel the world! Enjoy the finer things in life! She'll spend hours just ... playin' with 'er own minge!"
"Sure. And 'er Gary. We did it, mate!"
"Ya hear that, Gary? Nobody's applaudin'!"
What's this? What's she doin'?
"She's getting everyone back on 'er side! Oh, tha' clever cow!"
"There's not gonna be any Paris! Don't you get it, Gary?! The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again! She'll be workin' more than ever now! Our plan is ruined!"
All right! Everyone back! Get back I said!
"Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!"
Gettin' ou'a here Gary! One way or another!
"Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow, or so help me I'll blow your brains out!  I want a chooper! You got that?! And a jet waiting at the airport!"
"Come on, Gary! You always said you wanted to see Paris!"
"Stay back, mate!"
I'm warnin' you!
"No turnin' back now, Gary."
"Oh keep your head, Gary."
"Ah, Gary, that smells awful! Now I'm gonna throw up!  Try to leave and I'll shoot you too! You hostages aren't goin' anywhere till we get what we want!"
"Put it underneath me.  Slowly, mate, slowly!  Now back off.  All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button.  This is Oprah's minge!"
"I want a chopper, and a jet waiting at the airport to take us to France! Plus we need some fresh knickers right away."
"I'm not playing games with you, mate! Gary's drownin' in his own sick!"
"Don't be stupid, Gary. I've got a policeman. They'll fry me, lock you up for life."
"We're gonna get out of here, mate. Just leave it to me."
"If that chopper isn't here in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!"
I mean it! Hostages are gonna start dyin' if you don't listen!
"What the? Haha! You missed me, you stewpid buggers! You see that Gary? They can't even aim!"
"Gary, what's, what's wrong?"
No... Oh no!
"Try to hang on, Gary!"
Oh Gary! What have I gotten ya into?
"I'm 'ere, Gary!"
"Yeah. Yeah, we're in Paris, mate."
"Ih, it's beautiful. We've finally made it!"
"Well, there's the... Eiffel Tower right in front of us. The Louvre, right over there behind ya. And f-fresh baguettes all around."
"Gary? Gary, say somethin'.  You killed him, you bastards! He didn't even want any part in this! This is all your fault, you stupid cow! You never gave your ol' Gary the time of day and now he's gone! Life ain't worth livin' any more! What's the use?! ...I'm comin' to see you, Gary!  I'm comin' to see ya!"
