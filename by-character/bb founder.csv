"Mr. Mackey, what is happening here at your school is no different from what is happening all over the country. Bullying has become an epidemic, I'm afraid, and we at Bully Buckers TRADEMARK are trying to stamp it out. What is your school's policy on bullying?"
"Aha, well one of your students told us he thinks bullying at your school is getting worse."
He didn't want that disclosed.
We would like to have an anti-bullying assembly with your students this afternoon.
You believe positive thinking is really what's critical in schools right now? What's wrong with you?!
"No, shut up! What kind of counselor says no to an anti-bullying campaign?! Bullying needs to be stopped! Now! This afternoon!"
"Wuhhh duhhh. You may only have an Internet degree, but why don't you start acting like you're a school counselor and not an uninformed backwards little dork! M'kay?!"
"What makes a bully?  The truth is there are more bullies at your school than you even think. And the student who lets bullying happen is just as bad as the bully himself. Come on out, Lorraine.  I asked your school mate Lorraine here to help me out.  Are you bullied in the school, Lorraine?"
