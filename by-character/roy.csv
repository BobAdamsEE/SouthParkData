"Hello, son."
"Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me."
"Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood!"
"Son, could you please help me with the firewood?"
"When will you let me in? Let me love you?! Now, get your ass out here and help me."
Nnuuhunuuhh.
Chores. Do chores.
Well I'm not your dad. Okay? I'm not your dad! You- you can't just go around playing games with my emotions.
"Sharon? Sharon, have you seen my copy of Harper's?  Meet me at the clubhouse."
Sharon--  Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh.
He-
Hello?
Sharon?
Hello? Hel-lo? Could- could somebody get me d-? Hello?
"Hello? I sure am hungry. Anybody? It certainly does suck right here. Hello? Shuh- Sharon? Sharon, hello?"
