"Bullying isn't cool. Bullying is lame.
Bullying is ugly and has a stupid name.
For a healthy world, bullying's unfit.
And I think I know what we should do to i-it.
Do do do do do to i-it.
Let's all get together and make bullying kill itself.
Bullying's an ugly thing
Lets shove its face in the dirt and make bullying kill itself.
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh."
"We can make it stop. We can stomp it out.
We can beat its ass until it starts to cry.
Let's gang up on it and tell it it smells
And beat its ass worse if it ever te-lls.
If if if it ever te-lls.
Lets all join together to try to make bullying kill itself.
It'll be fun to see just how bad we can make it feel
and make bullying kill itself.
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh."
