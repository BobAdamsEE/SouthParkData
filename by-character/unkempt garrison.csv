"My gay side, uh- I DON'T HAVE A GAY SIDE!!!"
You aren't real! You can't be!
What do you want?
Why?
But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am!
I was just comparing size!
Aaa!
I was beating off to the chicks!
"OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER!"
NO!!!
"ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, I ADMIT IT! I'M GAY!!!  I'm...gay. I'm gay!  I am gay! You hear that everyone?  I'm gay! I'm gay! I'm gay and it...  and it feels good."
