"All right, gig is up. Put down the gun!"
Drop the gun and step away.
"Put it down, I said-  Augh!  Gawhh"
"Did your son say anything before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch?"
"Give it up, Bebe. We know all about it. The list was compromised. Kyle Broflovski is not the ugliest boy in the class."
You can explain all that downtown.
She must... die.
"Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner."
Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese.
"What did they rob, sir?"
"Sector Bravo, no activity."
The President?
"Code word is ""stretch,"" copy?"
Wait. Look! Up in the sky!
Thank youuu!
Up in the Yukon. All bureause are confirming it.
"If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir."
The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos?
Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in.
"The law is the law sir.  You can pay this by mail or appear in court on that date. Have a good day, sir."
You say something?
"Sir, we found this in the closet upstairs?"
Can I help you with anything?
"Okay, were you wit a cruise ship or land tour group?"
"Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything."
"All right, you, it's time to go."
Let's go.
"I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine."
"Hey, there he is! That's Charlie Manson!"
"Come back here, God damnit!  He's getting away!"

"1-Marshmallow, 2-Marshmallow,..."
"90-Marshmallow, 91-Marshmallow  This is making me hungry for marshmallows  92-Marshmallow"
Ow!
Hey you kids.
What the hell do you think you're doin'?
You sure you don't want to press charges?
You boys! Trent is trying to tell us the fire was your idea.
"I thought so. All right, that's it, Trent. You're going to Juvenile Hall for a long time!"
So let me get this straight. That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin.
"Sounds like an open and shut case. All right, let's head 'em out!"
"Stay back, people!"
Sir! More people in Beaverton are calling. They say they're trapped in floods and fire now.
"License and registration, please."
"...Sir, why don't you step out of the car for me?"
"Sir, I'm going to give you a sobriety test."
"Stand over here, please?  Right there. All right, now I want you to hold your arms out at your sides..."
And now touch your finger to your nose.
Touch your finger to your nose.
"Just bring one hand to your nose, like this."
What's goin' on here?
"...I understand. My, my brother's an alcoholic. Here, let me push you to the front of the line."
