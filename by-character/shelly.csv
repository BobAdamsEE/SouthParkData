Whats going on dad?
"Gross, Dad, sick!"
"Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!"
Why do you hate me?!
"Dad, the Internet's not working!"
I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
"What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead.  If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you!"
Amiiir... I miss you so much...
"What number are you, turd?"
You're nine twenty three now.
Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family!
This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!
Gggggyyaaah!
It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now!
What?
O... kay.
Yeah.
"Yeah, okay. Sounds good."
We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther!
"Turn it off, Dad!"
"What's going on, Dad?"
"What's going on, Dad?"
Dad!
It's gonna kill us!
"Mom, I can't see."
What is that? What is that?
Oh my Gohhhd!
"Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef."
"Do something, you stupid vegan!"
Go! Go!
Not the vegans!
Yes.
Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself.
Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school.
"What do you want, Larry?"
"What do you want, Larry?"
Hey!  Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox?
And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.
"Dad, what are you doing here?"
Finally.
I don't wanna go in there.
"Six.  We still, have, SIX."
God I hate this family!
I can't find it. Somebody took it.
"Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family."
"Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! "
"But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! "
"She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!"
So can I go or not?!
"Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys. "
"BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!"
"Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!"
Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!
Hey!
Are you looking at my headgear?
Are you looking at my headgear?
You little liar.
I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!
Who said that?
Are you staring at my neckbrace?
You'll never be bigger than me Stan.  Never!
What the hell do you want?
"Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now."
It's not Stan's fault.
"It wasn't Stan, he was…it was with me the whole time."
I will.
"That showsh for babiesh, it'sh show shtupid."
Jesus! What the hell are you doing?
"No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grampa?!"
You little jerk!  You were trying to kill grampa! I'm telling mom!
"Oh, whoo-peee!"
"Shut up, brat!"
Stop it!
"Serves you right, you little brat!"
"If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!"
We're watching this!
Give me the remote!
"Thank you, Aunt Flo."
"What do you say, Stanley?"
Okay.
Ew! You're gonna get it now.
"Ooooo, Stan's in trouble!"
Okay.
"I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time."
Bears?
"Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!"
"My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!"
Move!
"Figure it out, turd!"
"...So I said, ""you're a little turd!"" and he w-"
"...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.  ...stupid turd! The one night-"
"Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie."
I placed his underwear over his head.
"Well, I'm watching Friends, turd!  That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces."
"Hey, Skyler."
He's my boyfriend!
He's 22!
You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!
"Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments"
"No, Skyler. Quit it."
Eight days tomorrow.
"I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all."
"Well, maybe just one kiss."
"Go on, Astroturd!"
Turd Rock From the Sun!
We left you some crusts!
"Guess again, Richard the Turd!"
"You're such an amazing poet, Skyler."
"Skyler, not here."
Really?
Wow!
"O Skyler, I love you."
What the-?
Give me that picture!
"Open this door, Turdledove!"
Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you.
"Give me that picture, turd!"
I'm gonna bust this door down!
Who is that?!
"Skyler, your band can't practice here."
Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy.
Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!
We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
Not really. She's dead.
Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead!
"HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!"
You mean this one?
Honestly? I think you guys need some work.
I just think your sound is kind of... last week.
"Well, I do have a song I wrote."
"Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed!"
"Uhwwell, okay.  I'll try. But I'm not promising anything. 
1, 2, 3, 4
So much pain in the world today.
Too many turds are headin' my way.
But we can press our turds together.
Passing by turds whenever."
"Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do
in a world that's full of turds? TURDS!
llama judgin finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!"
In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!
"We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!"
Wha-?
What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!
What?! No you don't!
"...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us."
But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!
"Shut up, turd!"
What are you doing?
"Go away, turd!"
No.
NO!
"No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you!"
'Cause I'm twelve!
No!
What?? But I thought you liked me.
I don't care.  He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before.  I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid.
Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.
You don't think so?
You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how.
Huh?
Really? You would do that?
This won't take me long!
I'm almost done.
"Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay."
They're having a cat orgy!
Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
"Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home.  You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends."
No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.
"Wow, she passed out."
"Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay."
"I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in 
On Christmas Day, in the morning. 
And what was in those ships, all three? 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And what- 
Shut up, turds! 
-was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day, in the morning?
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
The Virgin Mary and-
Shut up, TUUUURDS! 
-Christ were there
On Christmas Day, in the morning.
Let us all rejoice, amain, 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
And let- 
I told you to shut up! 
-us all rejoice, amain,
On Christmas Day, in the morning. 
Shelly is starting to get pissed 
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day 
Shelly got up and killed the turds 
On Christmas Day, in the MORNING!"
"Geez, what's up Dad's ass?"
"Mom, what's up Dad's ass?"
"Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom."
"Let me hit him, Mom!"
"Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy."
The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!
That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time!
"No, turds!"
"Shut up, fat turd!!"
We're not watching this!
"There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!"
"All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it!"
"And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds!"
"I told you I needed tampons, tuurrddsss!"
"Shut up, turd! We're watching Friends!"
"I said shut up, turd!"
I wanna watch TV.
My brother is a stupid turd.
Me neither.
"I hate this family, I hate it!"
"Oh, you stupid turd!"
"Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!"
"I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!"
"Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you?"
"Oh, you are such stupid turds."
"Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job."
"Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return."
"Shut up, turd! You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did!"
"You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd."
"Oh my God, it's John Travolta!"
Praise Christ.
