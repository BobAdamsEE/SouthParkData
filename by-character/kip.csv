Ahhhhh.  Haaa! Haaaaaaaaaa! Yeah!
"Mom, Dad! I made a friend today!"
Yeah!!
"Kyle Broflovski! He's a student, and his interests include video games and reading."
"Oh, he's the best, Mom! He has a green hat, and he wants the world to stop talking about ninjas. Oh! I need to tell him what I'm currently thinking about! What am I currently thinking about?!"
"Mom, Dad, my best friend Kyle? He went to the dentist yesterday, and got two fillings! And today he's wondering if Hurt Locker really deserved the Oscar!"
Yeah!
"Oh yeah Dad, we've been havin' the best time! I showed him all the pictures of me and that silly Halloween costume last year."
He laughed out loud. And then he was rollin' on the floor laughin'!
"Mom, Dad, I'm all done. Can I go hang out with Kyle and tell him all about what I had for dinner?"
"Wow, thanks!"
"Ate a pork chop for dinner. Had nice apple sauce too.  Hahaa haha! Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
