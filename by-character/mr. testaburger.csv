Did you tell this little boy you were going to beat him up?!
"If there is any word of you fighting at school it's over for you, missy! Do you understand?!"
"We're so sorry about this, Ms. Cartman."
It won't happen again.
What the hell?
"Wendy, did a boy just pee on our door because the Smurfs were murdered?"
"Oh my God! Well this place is-! Oh my God!  Mrs. Polk, you're buying this stuff for your daughter?!"
Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?!  But these are our girls!
"Oh, uh-uh sure I-I can buy a purse."
"Nope. Wendy, I think they're right. You see, you have to believe in the rights of women. For too long they've had to live a double standard.  Oh yeah.  I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, Wendy. From now on you can have whatever you want from this store, I'll help make you the stupidest, most spoiled whore of them all!"
