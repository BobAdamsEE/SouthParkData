"Welcome back to Money Quest.  In just over two weeks, young financial genius Eric Cartman  has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands."
"Well, ahah I think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country."
Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time.
