Great job!
"Boys, you have really opened our eyes. We didn't even know this was happening."
"Well, Mr. Garrison, it looks like we were wrong about you. You really are teaching these kids something."
"Aw, I am really moved. I say we follow these boys's cause. Let's join them in the fight against corporate takeovers!  Lead the way, boys!"
"Mr. Tweek, we've only just heard."
"So, this is the corporate bulldozer trying to push you off the map."
"Don't worry, Mr. Tweek. This committee is not going to let you be run out of business by these bastards! Do you hear that? You're not gonna get away with this, you whore!"
...And we would have never even known that this was happening if not for these boys' excellent report.
That's right.
Yes!
"Mayor, these boys want that Harbucks coffee shut down right now!"
But they're ruining our city!
"What do you say, boys? We're gonna pass a law!"
"Well, what do you think?"
Yes it is. We'll put it on the air immediately.
"Toto, ladies and gentlemen!"
"All right. And now, before we all vote yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why are the lovable, innocent children."
That's not what you said last time.
