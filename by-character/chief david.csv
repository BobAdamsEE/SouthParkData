"We have called for this great meeting because if we are to survive this war, all the native Hawaiian tribes must join as one!"
"Look, if we are to fight the haoles, we have to allow all natives to say!"

Arm the bocce balls!

"Listen everyone, we gave it all we had. It's over. We must go down to Nowiliwili Harbor, and surrender to the American government."
"Young keiki, try to control your anger."
We are not surrendering today! Go back and tell your leaders that we will fight them until the end!
"And so it is with great honor that we recognize these two natives with their hapa noa. Take your cards, boys.  Apuiloa hapnanoaha! Hapa'a'a hohaaa!  It's finally over, young keiki. Is your anger at rest?"
