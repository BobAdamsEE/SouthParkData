"Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest!"
How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while?
Goo- goodbye Stanny!
Let's face it. The mountain lion will never let our Savior be born.
"Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead."
Are you sure?
"You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist!"
"Hey, look everyone! It's our old pal, Stanny."
We figured you'd be perfect!
To stop us?
How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.
You've got to come with us!
"Gosh, we did it!"
"Oh. Hiya, Stanny!"
"Wow, look, there's Santy Claus!"
