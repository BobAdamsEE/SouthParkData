"Catch me, Richard.  I'm so in love with you, Richard.  I made you some cookies, Richard.  Merry Christmas, Richard.  Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever.  Aaaaaaa!  Richard!"
"Swing me Richard, swing me higher. I wanna touch the sky, Richard.  Richard, I'm here!  Smile.  Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes.  But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you.  Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! It's what I do!  Aaaaaaa!  Richard!  Richard."
"Ri-chard!  Ri-chard!  Swing me Richard, swing me higher! Richard, I'm here!  Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes.  But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you.  Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot!  It's all for you!  Aaaaaaa!  Richard!"
"Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever.  But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you.  Don't worry, Richard. I'm a pilot!  Watch me, Richard!  Richard!"
Richard.
"Richard, you have to move on. I want you to be happy."
"Then say it now, Richard."
There. Now do you feel better?
"Of course you don't. Saying good-bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it."
"I love you, Richard. See you soon."
