"All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me!"
Wendy?
"We need to talk to you, right now.  Wendy, have you been bullying kids at school?"
"Well, do you want to explain why this little boy's mother had to come talk to us?"
"Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that?"
"Wendy, you tell this little boy you aren't going to hurt him!"
"Now, young lady."
"Whoa, whoa whoa, wait a minute. Are you saying we're all here just because a girl queefed on a boy?"
I tried to tell her she was too young.
But she's eight!
"Oh, wait. You're gonna do it right now?"
I still don't know about this.
