"Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium."
"Well, it is. But I have a bone disease which impedes my ability to pronounce the ""t"" in ""plane'arium"""
"Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.  Yes, little boy?"
"Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works."
"Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us."
"Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we?"
"Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable."
And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... ehcome out.
"Here we see the constellation called, ""The Big Dipper"". If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it,  a-hah , we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull , while these stars form the constellation, ""Roger Ebert"" . And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades . Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of..."
"And now breathe deep as the stars sloowwly start to move in little circles.  I know you think plane'ariums are boring, but I'm gonna try to change the way you think about that."
"Goodbye, children. Thanks for visiting. Don't forget: we have Laser Rock shows at night here at the plane-'arium. This week it's Laser Kenny Loggins and Laser James Taylor."
You will not remember what happened here. To remember it will cause incredible pain.  Incredible pain!  Incredible icky paaiin!
"Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more."
"Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children?"
"Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star."
"Certainly, Mr. Garrison.  You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab-  and right over here we see the constellation Orion.  Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsar..."
"Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming."
"Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volunteer work here."
Mr. Garrison?
Excellent! Why don't we step over here and I'll show all you children how to volunteer.
"Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium"
"Oh. Hello, officer of the law."
What brings you out here?
"Oh, really?"
"Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time."
"Of course, officer. Come on in."
"Would you like to see the stars, officer?"
And this is the constellation called Cassiopeia.
"And now, officer, from this moment on, you will think that you are Elvis Presley."
To not be Elvis will cause you great pain.
"You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me."
"Why? Because nowadays kids have computers, surround-sound television. They've forgotten all about plane'ariums. But I'll make them remember, starting with the two of you!"
"No, you idiot! He thinks he's Elvis.  Elvis, escort our guests to the plane'arium."
Aaah. Aaah. Aaah.
