"Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit."
"Well then, if you wanna see REAL fights with REAL brutality, go here.  This is the underground stuff, so keep it quiet.  And you might wanna pack a barf bag."
"Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it?"
"Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tired. Ongh, so sleepy."
"Are you sure you got everything you need, young man?"
