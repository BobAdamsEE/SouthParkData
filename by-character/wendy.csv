...yeah.
"Of course, Stan."
This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.
Which one? We make lists all the time.
"Look, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-"
Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's just not something we do flippantly! There's protocol!
"All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy."
"If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we...  That we reopen last week's list for debate."
Go ahead.
He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
"Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something!  Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle."
It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list.
Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?
"I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-"
"Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one."
"Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here.  We need to remake that list."
"Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in."
You knew!
So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!
No. Not Bebe.
"When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-"
I don't think so!
"Stan, run!"
What?
You've compromised everything! Our lists' integrity!
"It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, those are amazing."
Is that a lace across the top?
"Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!"
"It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know."
"Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way."
"Thanks, Stan."
"Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then."
What's going on?
Over here. This looks like an office.
I can't get a dial tone.
They must be negotiating.
"Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on!"
"Where are you going, Stan?"
"Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork."
Hey look.
"Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common-"
Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
"This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!"
Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
No you aren't!
What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!
You'd better shut up  or I'll make you shut up!
I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
"That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!"
You think you're tough?
I'll smack the shit out of you!
After school! We fight after school! You got that?!
That's right!
"As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there."
You're gonna  fucking die!
What?!
What?
"If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!"
"No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!"
Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
Get away from me!
What?!
You really think that's gonna work on me?!
You can't bribe your way out of this!
No you don't.
"You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!"
That's right.
"Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!"
You fucking suck so hard!!
What are you doing?!
Ew!
Oh my God!
No!
You are so pathetic!
Tomorrow morning! You fucking die tomorrow morning!
Yeah?
What? No!
You don't understand. He said horrible things.
"Mom, you don't-"
I'm not going to hurt you.
Yes sir.
You know I can't fight you!
I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
I can't!  God damn it!
You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.
Why?!  Why are you doing this to me?!  Why won't you just stop?!
God!
"No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight."
Yes ma'am!
Ma'am?
My... parents said that if I fight-
Yes ma'am!
I don't care!
I'm finished!
"That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. 
Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out!"
"East side, west side, whatever side that you're on."
We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair.
Hey Stan.
What?
"Stan, that's ridiculous."
I would never leave you for Bridon.
No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants.
"Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together."
You gave it up?
How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?
"Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?"
What day?
Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!
God they're so stupid!
What's going on?
"It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie."
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
"Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you."
And he's not fat at all.
"You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman."
Leave me alone.
Stan!
Is what true?
I don't have time for this.
Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
"Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you!"
"I really don't care, Stan."
"I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself!"
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it."
"Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house."
If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?
Sure.
Okay.
"I don't, I, I have no idea what-"
"I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-"
"Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option."
"What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?"
"I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?"
"Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!"
"No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that."
"And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president."
"No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs."
"Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay."
James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.
Am I a joke to you?
"I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?"
"You DO have a Facebook page, Stan!"
"Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?"
"You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page,  we aren't friends!"
"And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to ""In a relationship""!"
"By editing your profile under ""basic information""!"
"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume."""
"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume."" What is that supposed to mean?!"
That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you!
"Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called ""hoarding."" People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore."
Stan? We need to talk about your locker.
Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.
It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.
"No, Stan, it's called ""hoarding""! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!"
Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?
"Okay.  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan."
"Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?"
Thank God.
This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?
Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?
I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.
"Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-"
"You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!"
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?!
"So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?!"
Specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack.
Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.
"We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!"
"Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while."
"Oh, you mean Kyle?"
"Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams."
Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-
Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-
"Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!"
"Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please?  Mr. Garrison?!"
"Ugh, Jesus! "
This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
Cheer Squad roll call! 
"You guys stop it! Okay Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?"
What?
"See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?"
"But Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?"
"Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!"
What the fuck is your problem?!
Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!
Yeah!
Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!
"She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!"
What?!
"This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!"
"Look it up, stupid!  In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit!  You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! "
Oh good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good!
...Are you serious?
That's not his girlfriend! It's Kim Kardashian!
"Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit."
"I'm not ""jel"", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school!"
"Butters. Butters, come here for a sec."
"Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?"
"I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?"
"Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides . We select the eyes , make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin , lengthen the neck , add more to the hair , select the lips and make them fuller , take out any puffiness on the skin  here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin , streamline the shoulders , put highlights in the eyes , and, there."
Do you see what I'm talking about?
That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.
What? What do you mean?
Butters!
Excuse me!
Why would I be jel?
She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point!
Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! 
"I'm sorry. It's nothing personal, Lisa."
"I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way!"
"Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that-"
Jelly school?
"Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make."
"Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes."
"Thank you, Mr. Mackey, I will... change."
Cheer Squad roll call! 
"And I'm your captain, Wendy! "
"I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!"
"Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! "
What?
"So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!"
Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.
"Yeah.  And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders.  The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nicole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair.  And Heidi Turner's butt is flat!  Oh God damn it!"
Ugh!
Wendy.
"Let's just get back to cheering, okay?!"
"See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit! This has gone way too far!  And if society won't fix it, I will!"
Something that should have been done a long time ago! 
Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.
...Nooo.
"Not lately, no."
NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!
"That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts!"
"That's fine!  People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me!"
Agh! What do you want?
"Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly."
"Nono, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry."
Hi everybody. I love you!
So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy??  Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! 
So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
And why do you think young people-?
...Why do you think young people are responding to this?  I'm asking you a question! 
You're... back?
"Oh wow, I'm shocked."
"You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be ""free to chase your dreams""."
"Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be  ""dripping in bitches""?!"
"I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love!"
"Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?"
So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.
"You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?"
"Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!"
Thought so.
"Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off."
"You're so transparent, Stan."
You wanna dance?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is the girls bathroom!
WHAT?!
GET OUT OF HERE!
Cartman is using our bathroom!
"Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-"
That isn't fair!
Hey guys.
How's it hanging'?
It's cool. I'll wait.
"Yeah, I heard the girls volleyball team won by like 20 points."
Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.
"Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks."
"Hi, guys."
"Here, Stan. This is for you."
Eww!
"Hi, Stan."
Eww!
"But why, Stan?"
Eww!
Huh?
What happened to your little brother?
"Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?"
"Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the visitors are using him as part of their plan. Maybe you should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back."
"Come on, Stan."
Eww!
"Hey, he's like Rudolph."
"Whatever, dude."
Cool!
Eww!
"Hey, look. A French fry."
And what is that?
"Hey, what's that?"
"Hey, what about that?"
"Wow, I knew I would win."
What?
He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
My paper was on the suffering of bottlenose dolphins.
What?
Hitler was famous too.
"Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated."
Hi guys.
I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this.
"Hello?  My essay by Eric Cartman: ""When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."""
Oh my God.
"You guys, we have to stop him!"
Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
He's got a gun!
"It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!"
"Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?"
"Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!"
I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
You should have won that talent show.
"I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer."
"You see, I've learned something today. You can't win all the time. And if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose."
Gooood.
"You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.  I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place."
"Well, not if it's Cartman.  Hey, where are you all going!  They don't even know what Walden is.  I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was."
"Ah, what the hell."
"Hi, Stan."
Yeahhh?
"I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look."
"I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca."
Eww.
Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.
Hi guys.
"Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi."
Let's go trick-or-treats.
"Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad."
But Stan!
AAAAAAAAAAAH!
Aaahahah!
Aaahh.
Aaah!
Aaah!
"Oh, what happened? Stan?"
I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.
"Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.  Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross!"
Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!
Many would rather die than go to those places!
Unh  Oh!
Aaaah!
UUuuhh-UUuuhh
Okay
"You guys, look!  It's snowing!"
Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue  It's fun.
Yeah.
I believe in Mr. Hankey.
"Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day."
Maybe we should go on a cruise or something.
"I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise."
-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
Stan? Stan?!
"Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?"
Well it is!
"Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?"
"Stan? We're still Valentines, right?"
"Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you?"
"I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan."
"Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen?"
Don't fuck with me!
"You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!  Bye, Ms. Ellen."
"When someone gets as old as you,  do they have to wear Depends undergarments?"
"Hi, Stan."
"HI, STAN!"
"I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen."
"Yes, she was!"
"Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!"
It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!
NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!!
"Thanks for coming over, Bebe."
"That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe."
"Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover."
"Hi guys, what's up?"
"Oh. Hi, Stan.  I think it worked, Bebe."
DIE!!
"Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!  He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now."
Wwhat?
You...you can't.
Noooo! Noooo!
Nooo!! Nooo!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
It's over. I give up.
Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you?
No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting.
"No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends."
"And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,  and I've learned from it.  I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world."
"Oh, coool!"
Wow.  What incredible irony.
"Yeah, you just never know."
"Happy Valentine's Day, Staan."
Eeewwww!
"No, it's okay, Stan!  Everything's going to be o-kay!"
"Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher."
"Oh, hi, Kyle!"
U-huh. Excuse me.  Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq!
Laq hemblaq henlaq henlalah qemblaq!
Kaqemblaq!
"Wait, wait!  It's time to whip out the eclipse shoebox thing!  Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen."
I told her. Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger!
"Hey, he's like Rudolph."
Mmmm.
But Mr. Garrison!
Mmmm.
Wow! Cool!
No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
"Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!"
Hrmph!
"Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?"
"Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them."
Sshh!
"Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening!"
"Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie?"
Eeewww!
"Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films."
"Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass."
"Hi, Stan."
"Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today?"
She does. She looks very pretty.
"Stan, can I talk to you for a second?  Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?"
"If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace."
"Yeah, Stan."
You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
"Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!"
"I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend."
Is the clubhouse ready?
"Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?"
"Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!"
"Hi, guys."
I will. Kyle?
Truth or Dare?
How about we give him Bebe?
Okay.
Kiss Bebe on the lips!
"What's the matter, Kyle?"
"Your turn, Bebe."
"Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow."
"Wow, that sucks!"
"I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here."
What's happening?
Oh cool!
"Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!"
"Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!"
Yeah!
Dare ga pu shita no.
1776.
"It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus."
"We'll march with you, Chef."
How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!
Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!
Nooo!
"Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-"
Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.
What??
"Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate."
The South Park flag!
D'aaaaahhh!
"This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-"
If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-
"Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!"
"That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!"
"I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote."
"Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument."
Huh?
"Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman."
Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument.
Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite.
"Hey, that's what I always do, too!"
"Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman."
Aha ha.
"Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  We can show that the-"
No.  You go ahead.
Cartman!
Say it'll be like this forever.
"Oh, Cartman!"
"AAAAAAaaaah!  Brrrrr. What's wrong with me?  Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl."
Aaaah!
"Oh God, please don't let this be happening."
"Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you."
"Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman."
I know.
"Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-"
"You mean, I should kiss him?"
Oh God.
"The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  the… the- uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we-  ah…  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment?  Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee..."
"There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you."
Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.
"I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished."
I'm totally back to normal. See you later.
"Hahaha.  Stan. Stan, wait up!"

Yeah!
What's that?
"You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?"
"Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay?"
Oh no! NO!
My poor little Helen.
"She can't see or hear us, John."
"I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey."
Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?
"Oh, no!"
"John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick
When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch."
"She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen!"
"...Helen! 
I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!"
Oh no! Oh no!!!
There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.
"Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?"
"Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited."
I didn't mean that-
"Stay away from me, Stan!"
Are you wearing a condom?
Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
"You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS."
"Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!"
Yeah. Thank God.
"We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!"
"The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!"
I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing?
Hey Bebe.
"Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs."
"...And I was like, ""I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars."""
"Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys."
"Oh, for Christ's sake!"
"""The new Cold War"""
"But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-"
No!
Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.
I heard that her asshole is this big around.
"Oh, hey Bebe.  Slut.  Slut."
"Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner.  Slut.  Slut."
Slut.
What are you doing?!
I'm class president! The vote was last fall!
"She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else!"
"Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid!"
Yes! I want to get breast implants!
That's what I said.
"I have three thousand dollars, cash."
"Hi, everybody."
"Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him."
Yeah?
Well tell Stan to fuck off!!
But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?
We're gonna miss what?
Who's Paris Hilton?
I don't get it. What's she do?
...But what does she do?
What does she do?!
"You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?"
But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!
"Hey Jessie , hey Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange."
"Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?"
What?!
"Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society."
"It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon."
"I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations."
"Dad, there's a new store at the mall called ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!"
Dad!
"Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight."
I'm a stupid spoiled whore.
That's okay.
Yes.
"No, I need help."
"Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend."
"No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you"
"Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know."
Can you teach me your secret fast?
Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.
What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there.
"That's okay, you guys."
"I know. Let's do ""Light as a feather, stiff as a board.""  Who wants to do it first?"
"Light as a feather, stiff as a board."
I think we went too far with Marjorine.
"I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school."
"You're not ugly, Marjorine."
"Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine?"
Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg.
"No. No, that's my egg."
"But I made that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it."
I wanna see my egg.
I want to see my egg.
"Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it."
...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes.
"Don't let anything happen to it, please."
"Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad."
