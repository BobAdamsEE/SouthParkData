"Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow Terminator rules. That is, it's one way only and you can't go back. This is in contrast, say, to Back To The Future rules, where back and forth is possible, and of course, Timerider rules, which are just plain silly. Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay."
"Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears that another person from the future has just arrived!  It looks as if the job at Wendy's did work for the original immigrant; this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off, and wishes the same for his family."
"Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where some kind of mass protest has broken out.  Hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time immigrants are here having sex with one another.  These men have apparently sucked and screwed their way across the state and are now here at the time border trying to get national attention. These unemployed men have been having sex for several days. Joining me is their spokesperson, Randy Marsh.  Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?"
Do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?
"Young man, what do you think about all this?"
