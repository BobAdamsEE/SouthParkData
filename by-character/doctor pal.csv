"Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal. That's because I'm a doctor, but I'm also your pal. Are we cool?"
"A lot of times parents call me in because I can relate to younger kids. I'm I'm down, I'm dope, you dig? Now, I understand you have some concerns about erections.  ""Oops, can't say erection in front of the parents right. Oh God, I feel so weird"" huh?"
"Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random erections. Almost every boy goes through a phase where his penis becomes hard... for no particular reason. It's just part of growing up. Growing up? Growing out is more like it."
"Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don't you skedaddle for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo."
"Jimmy, as you get older your body goes through a lot of changes. Certain hormones start to release as your whole reproductive system begins to awaken, and so, if you like, we can take off our shirts and kiss."
"Oh, hey, nothin', you see? See, that set you off on a different tangent, got you thinkin' a different way. That's what Doctor Pal is here to do.  Unless, of course, you think we should take off our shirts and kiss."
"Well then to hell with you, kid. You can just deal with your problems on your own."
