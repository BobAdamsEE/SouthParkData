No I don't!
"Come on, let's eat already! They gave me extra bread and water!"
"Yeah, well I'b I busted out."
Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here.
"If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids."
"Come on up, it's okay.  Another inmate busted out with me. Don't worry, he's a good guy."
"All right, Chuck, but we gotta lay low for a while."
"All right, Chuck. Let's watch some TV or something."
"Hey, bring us down some food, all right?"
"Chuck, can you turn that thing down?"
"Okay, Chuck! Thank you very much!"
"Wow, sweet!"
What's the matter?
"Oh, bummer."
"Uh, that's okay, Chuck. You just keep watching Christmas specials."
The cops are here!
"Get down, Ma!"
"What the hell is wrong with you, Manson? You're acting all funny! Everybody just sit down and shut up! We're not going back to the big house!"
"Wow, she's really pissed."
Damn it! What are we gonna do?
"Damnit, Dad, why didn't you put a back door on this house?!"
"That's it! We're going out the bathroom window! Come on, Manson!"
"Come on, damn it!  Well, it's good seeing you all. Don't move until we're gone or I'll shoot you dead. Happy holidays."
"All right, it's open! Let's go!"
"All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go."
What?!
Now can we go??
"Oh, weak!"
"Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and Dad. I hope you can forgive me."
"I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help."
