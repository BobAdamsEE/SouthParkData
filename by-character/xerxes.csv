"Tumon, how could you have failed me in this simple task? I am so seriously pissed off right now. I could bust a testicle."
I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself.
Why are you lesbians being so difficult?
I don't know why you have to be all superlame about this.
"Okay, how about this?  I will make you the manager of Club Persh. You'll make good money."
How..? How did you find that out?
You don't understand. Women can't be the boss in Persian culture. Nobody can know about this.
You do? Seriously?
No. I don't even know how two women... can make love. Unless they just kind of  scissor or something.
"Ohh, that feels so supercool!"
"Ohh, I'm a new woman!"
"No. Thank you, friend."
