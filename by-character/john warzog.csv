"Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warzog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network.  Fuck you.  Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there."
"Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked.  Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Sommers.  Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you!"
