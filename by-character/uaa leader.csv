Time Child! You've returned!
"TC, wait!"
You gained the otters' trust?! Were you wearing an information crystal?!
"You've done a great thing, TC.  How can we repay you?"
"Fellow atheists: the time child has returned with information on our sworn enemies, the Allied Atheist Alliance. They have started digging for clams in sector J7. If we mount an all-out attack, we can wipe out their food supply!"
We cannot tolerate the otters! Their Science is flawed! Their answer to the Great Question is different from ours.
...That's why we have to be super-duper sure that nobody finds out we're doing it.
"My friends, the time has come! May Science give us the courage to do what we must! Launch all defensive ships to sector J7! Take out the otters' clam fields!"
The United Atheist League is bombing the city! We're defenseless!
What?! Three-way phone channel onscreen!
You fools! This will be the end of us all!
Your answer to the Great Question is illogical!
&gt;Unified Atheist Allianace makes more sense.
W-we told you: we're sending you home. With the Crank and Wank Time Machine.
But now the moment has come to send you back to your time.
"So long, Eric. And tell everyone in the past for us, that no one single answer... is ever the answer."
