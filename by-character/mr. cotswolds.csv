"Alright, Rebecca. Good job, honey."
"Come, children, let's take our trophies home and place them high up on the mantel."
"Yes, Mark?"
"Well, because, son, public schools are inefficient and dangerous!"
"Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it."
"Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is!"
"You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca?"
"Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe!"
Who was that?
Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea.
"Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close!"
"Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now."
That must be him.
"Oh my God, son!"
"Mark, what have they done to you?!"
"Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools!"
"Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers."
"Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments.  My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy."
Cotswolds.
"Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better.  And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop."
"Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?"
"I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!"
"No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers."
"I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school."
"Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise."
"Mark, where's your sister?"
"Oh, alright."
"Rebecca, don't play that perverted game!"
Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling!
They've got to be here somewhere.
Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!
"Mark. You're absolutely right.  Okay, children. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school."
What?!
