"Good afternoon, students. We are going to be a doing a health screening today. It won't take long, it'll be relatively painless, but we need to see if any students are showing... symptoms.  I'n a moment, I'm going to show you a suggestive picture.  And then I'm going to ask you a question about that picture. Alright, ready? Here we go."
"Please just study the picture the best you can, students. I'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided."
"Okay, very good.  Now, what color... was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand? Write down your answer, please: what color was the handkerchief... in the nice lady's hand?"
"Very good, turn your answers over please."
"Alright, now, who answered that the handkerchief was... yellow?  Very good, very good indeed. Now I'd like to see who answered ""What handkerchief?""  A-ha! You three boys, please come with me."
"I'm sorry boys, but I'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction."
"We're gonna have to send you home, I'm afraid."
"Our nice-lady-with-the-handkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough. I'm sorry, but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal, well-adjusted students."
"A life of desperation and anguish, I'm afraid. Your addiction will start off slowly - magazines, Internet sites - but then, as you keep chasing your high your tastes will get more and more dangerous. Most likely you'll end up going the way of David Carradine and Michael Hutchence: autoerotic asphyxiation."
"I don't want to go into too much detail but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome."
