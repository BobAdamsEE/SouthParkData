Did she just call us emos?
"And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something?"
"Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad."
It's about freaking time.
What the hell are those kids doing?
Are they trying to be Goth?
"So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?"
Really. Do you guys even smoke?
Oh my Gohhd.
"All right, Count Fagula, you just do that."
"What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!"
More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?
...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.
We aren't trying to be popular!
Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes.
"Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now."
Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.
"It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening. I mean, why now?"
Whattaya mean?
Does your mom know you took her car?
"Yeah, pull over here."
"Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart."
"If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way."
"No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies."
They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!
I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.
"Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us."
What are you talking about?
"Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?"
How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!
Let's get to it.
You should probably get out of here.
"Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's ""fun"", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded."
Just go on and take the picture.
Ugly! (ugly ugly ugly ugly)
"But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and-"
"Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel."
Whoa... That's pretty hardcore. 
And that's all you know? what else did she say?
"Oh my God, for two weeks?"
Whoa...
Oh my God! They're totally different!
"They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible!  You're, you know... They're posers!"
That's a huge fucking difference!
"This fuckin' bitch, man."
Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.
"No, see, you're nihilistic."
"What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?"
What the hell have they done to you?
Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person. 
"Uugh, how could she hang out with them??"
Hello?
What is? Everything? 
No way.
I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.
I promise.
"Not now, lady, we're really depressed."
"This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos!  There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires."
What choice do we have?!
"Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help."
"Ugh. You spit on me, Larry.  Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, aaand we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall."
"But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem."
"Now, shut up Mike. Listen, okay? There's a camp that kids like us are being sent to, a-and somehow this place is taking kids like us and... turning them Emo.  Yeah. You might not even be able to tell at first. It could have already happened. One of you might already be turned."
"Uhhhhh, right."
You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!
We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.
"This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!"
"No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!"
"Look, we came to you for help, and all you've done since then is waste our time! "
"Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos."
Right!
Thank you!
I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.
"Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos."
"Uh, yeah, it kind of does."
"Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out."
"Cut it out, Edgar! It's annoying everybody!"
Michael?! You here?
"Dude! Michael, are you okay?"
"Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. "
"Ugh! Let us go, you ultimate conformists!"
Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?
What?!
"Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you?  What the hell are you doing?! Yo're supposed to be helping us!"
"Look, we  summoned you to help us save the world!"
"God, he is such a downer! "
NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! 
"Hey, these are just plants."
What?? 
Did you know about this?
"Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants.  From Lowe's Home and Garden."
"Ahh, hang on. What I meant to say was  we just infiltrated the Emo lair and... we torched the plant leader."
"Uhhh, we're just gonna wait until the PS4s become cheaper and more available."
What's VHS?
"Hey uh, excuse me?"
"The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?"
"Yeah, we know. We're with the wedding."
"Life is pain. Life is only pain.  We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings.  But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that  eats at your soul."
Just to make life more miserable for the conformists.
"Yeah, happiness dies."
"Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!"
"Dude, you haven't drank your coffee."
You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee.
"Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole?  You just don't know what real pain is."
I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.
Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
Yeah.
Dance troupe? Please.  We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school.  Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.
No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.
I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.
Yeah. We just got Goth-served.
