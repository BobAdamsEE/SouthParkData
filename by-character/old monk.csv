"What do you seek, Father?"
That Gospel...  lies somewhere beyond this door.  But... many troubles await thee inside! Only he whose heart truly belongs to the Lord shalla make it through.
"Then, prepare yourself. The time of trials begins.  Adoramus te, Christe!  I wish you luck, Father. Use all the strength, agility, and faith that you have."
