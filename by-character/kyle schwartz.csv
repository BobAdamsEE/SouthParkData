"Hello, Aunt Sheila."
"Oh, it was terrible. They recycled the air on board and it really did a number on my asthma. I-I-e-I asked them to turn up the oxygen and they wouldn't."
"Hi, Uncle Gerry."
It's nice to meet you.
"Av-a-a-alright, I'm done."
"Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice."
"It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good."
a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents.
"Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad."
"Yes, wa-a-I didn't think ""hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot"" really counted as nice."
"Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you."
"Hey hey,  I'm just your naughty-and-nice accountant! Don't blame me for the numbers!"
"But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?"
"Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth."
"If you cure cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents."
"Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do... the nicest, greaatest thing anyone has ever done. Ever."
