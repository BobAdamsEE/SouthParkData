"Alright, this is a very simple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit Disorder."
"Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you a book called, ""The Great Gatsby,"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I'll ask you a few questions. Are you ready?"
"Okay, here we go.  ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since""  ""so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
"Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby drive?"
"Well, that settles it!"
This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder!
"Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today. I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and we'll see how that goes for little Timmy."
"""After a while I went out and left the hospital, and walked back to the hotel in the rain.""  Alright now, in Chapter 12, what kind of bottles did Miss Van Campen talk about?  Anybody?  Anybody?? My God, these children all have ADD!"
It's Ritalin for all of you!
That's easily another twenty grand apiece!
"Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit-"
Huh?
"Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-"
Mm- my God. What have we done??
"We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them."
"Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?"
