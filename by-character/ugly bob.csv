"Hey. Hey there.  You going to Canada too?  What am I saying? Of course you're going to Canada. You're Canadian, sure enough. Open your Box of Faith, did you? Me too. They can't take our princess and get away with it. Mind if I sit down?  Soon as I heard the call there was no question I was gonna sign up. Didn't care how far away I was. I was gonna get to that rally point at the tree in Edmonton. Didn't know there were other Canadians living here in the U.S. I'm from Toronto originally, but everywhere I went people were terrified by my disfigurement. I have to wear this bag on my head because I'm hideously ugly. Had to move here to the United States. Here, people don't think I look ugly. They just think I look Canadian.  The name's Ugly Bob."
"Oh, the giant!"
"Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh?"
Who?
The Native Canadians?
He says that the taking of the princess was foretold.
"He says Eskimos do hate us Canadians, but that there's an even bigger thread to Canada who has the princess."
"He said the evil that took her wasn't Canadian at all, but a beast who preys upon people of all nationalities. They can lead us to the best, but we will have to destroy it."
"Aw, leave the kid alone, Scott."
"Don't worry. If there's one thing eskimos are good at, it's finding things."
Wait a minute.  Look!
It's coming for me! Help!
Hello Terrance. Hello Phillip.
How come you guys say stuff like that?
"Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip."
How can you guys say stuff like that?
"I know, but--"
"I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside."
"Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks."
"Thanks, you guys."
"Hi, guys."
People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday.
Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there!
"All right, then. There's a flight leaving today."
Hi guys.
I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like?
Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.
"Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch."
"I'm Bob. But my friends call me Ugly Bob, because I have the features of a deformed burn victim."
You can?
"Did you say, ""hostile takeover of Canada""?"
"God bless you, Phillip."
