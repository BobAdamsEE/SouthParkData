"Hello Eric, your room is upstairs to the left. Are you hungry?"
You can call me Mom if you like.
"Stop it, children! We do not speak such certainties in this house!"
Who could that be?
"Yes, yes, we have that."
What is that?
It was like a... little mystery person... flying around.
Ohhh...
What is it?
But how did it get here?
"You shut your mouth, you filth-fucking asshole!"
I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
