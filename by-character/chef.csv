I'm sorry boys.
Wow!
What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?
Good-bye! ..
"Hello there, children!"
"Well, it's true."
That's right.
Yeah!
Nnono!
That's right.
That's right. Randy!
Thank you. Jimbo.
That's right! Thank you. Good-bye- Everybody.
You bet! Good-bye. Children!
"Hello there, children!"
How's it goin'?
"Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?"
"Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love."
"I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle."
"I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children."
"Hello there, children!"
"Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love."
"Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass"
"I specializes in your asshole, Kyle."
"Come on, children. Let's all go home and make love."
I just like to make love up your butt.
"Doctor, do you have- children?"
Have you all been sodomizing your children too?
I'm gonna make love to the children.
"Aw, come on, children. Let's go home."
God-damn!
Wait a minute.
Children! What have I done?
I'm goinna- I'm gonna-
"I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!"
"Hey children, everybody! I'm back!  Ow."
Oh!
Children!
I can't... break these locks.
Children! Run!
I'm sorry children.
"Get the hell out of here, children!!"
Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww!
Ah!
POOOT!
What'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen?
"Hello there, children."
"Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley."
"Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?"
"Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?"
Oh! Did they give you an anal probe?
That's when they put a big metal hooba-jube up yo' butt.
"Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control."
"Hello there, children."
How are you doing?
Why bad?
"Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.
I'm gonna make love to ya woman
Gonna lay ya down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make ya moan and perspire
Gonna--"
--get those juices flowin'--
--we're makin' love gravy--
"--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!"
Love luh-- Huh?  Do you feel better?
"Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day."
"What?!  What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!"
"It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.  This could mean the visitors want to communicate with us."
"It's no joke, children, this is big!"
"Uuh, hold on now, hold on now.  Uhyouyouyou gotta help the children."
"Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out!  Okay children, this is your chance!"
"Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien visitors. I've got to get myself ready."
"Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom!  And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on."
"Wait, where are you going, alien visitors? Come back!"
"Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in."
Hello there children.
How are my little crackers today?
Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
"Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation."
"Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway."
"Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you down.
And lick every inch of your body with my tongue."
"Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy."
How 'bout you and me-
-get together and make... sweet... love?
"Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!"
He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
"Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?"
"But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?"
"Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!"
Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
"Oh no, look."
That's Scuzzlebutt.
"Mmmm
Baby, every time that we kiss
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat
Lava so warm and red and wet
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr."
"Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited and nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against the Middle Park."
"But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice."
"Yes Pip, what is it?"
"I know Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody."
"Yes Pip, I'm afraid it does."
"Sorry son, now get your ass in there."
Hike the damn ball!
"Huh? Oh fine, fine."
Elementary school alumni?
I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
Hmmm.  I don't think we have a chance.
Great pass Stan.
Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
"Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover.  Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! 
Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm."
"Spank it, ever so gently."
Spank it.
"Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays."
"No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you."
"That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?"
"What's the matter Stan, you seem down."
"Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks."
Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
"Well, you're gay aren't you?"
"Well, you sure do act like it."
"Oohh, come on Stan."
"No Pip, I'm sorry!"
"You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle."
It's a little late for that bullcrap now.
What's the matter?
"Come on, Cows. We'll get a delay of game penalty."
Hike the ball.
"Hey, come on. That was roughing. At least let us scrape him off the field."
Where the hell have you been Stan?!
Just get in there boy!
Hello there children.
How you doin'?
Why bad?
"Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?"
"Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won'tâ€¦A pig-elephant.  Say, now that's not a bad idea."
"Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house.  Children, we could make a fortune with this."
"Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love."
Sure they would.  But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.
"Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk."
"Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?"
Hello children.  I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.
"Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood. 
Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.
Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!"
"Thank you Elton.
Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay."
"Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life.  The beauty of Mother Nature."
"Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt."
"Oh, they will.  It's gonna be one uuuugly sight."
"Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.  Uh oh, here we go.  Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.  Or a big fat elephant."
"Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days."
"Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill."
Hello there children.
How's it goin'?
Why bad?
"You can't kill my grampa Stan, he's already passed on."
"No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal."
I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
Hello children.
What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
"Hello, children."
Aaaaah!
"Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?"
Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye!
Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
Doctor!
"No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead."
"Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!"
"Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr!"
"Oh, sorry.  But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here."
"Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?"
Aaaaaaaaaah!
"Mayor, we've got a big problem."
"Actually, uh-"
I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
"No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!"
"Aw, the hell with you both!"
Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!
"Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them."
"Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!"
"Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha!"
Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
"Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town."
I'm working on it children.
"The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue."
Just look for anything suspicious.
You better let me take that Kyle.
I gotta call this hotline number children.
Look out children!
"I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid."
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
You did it children!
"Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees."
"Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts."
"Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA."
What does it mean?
"Oh, fudge!  Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again."
"It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!"
What the-?!
"Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...  What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?"
No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
"Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!  We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys."
"Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!"
Stay close children.
We've saved Thanksgiving!
"Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love..."
"Say, where's Kyle?"
What? Why?
Chirstmas poo?  You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey.
Well!  You can believe in him now.
"Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!"
"I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey.  The whole town is about to kill each other."
"Hello there, children."
How's it going?
Why bad?
"Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song:
We're all special in our own way
Everybody's different, but that's okay
'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin
Different points of view, be tall or thin
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...
What were we talking about again?"
Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker!
"We've got to do something, children!"
"Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!  Not you, dammit!"
Ooh crap.
Oh ooh.
Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
"Yup! Here's your present, children.  Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later."
"I know, but the fight is starting."
Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.
"Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!"
"Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?"
"Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?"
Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.
That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
Thaat's right!
That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it...
"Oh, hello."
I'm Chef.
I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.
Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.  What was your name again?
"Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you."
If we can have dinner tonight.
"Hello there, children."
Not too good.
"No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team.  Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion.  Don't you understand? She's a lesbian."
You boys don't know what a lesbian is?
"Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians."
"Now move along, children, you're holding up the line!"
"Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it..."
"Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV."
"Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef."
"Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?"
No. Not since 'Yentl.
Too late for what?
Why do you care?
"I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin."
"Come on, man. What is this all about?"
Hmmm.
"Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope."
Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a runor.
It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.
"Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!"
"Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-."
Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?
"Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!  Forget I asked!"
And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?
"Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good."
"Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all."
"There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B."
"Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!"
"Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin?"
Where?
"Ooh, fudge!"
Children!
I can't - break these - locks!
"Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?"
"This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you."
"Look out, children!"
Sidney Poitier?
"Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!"
Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.
Is that really necessary?
"It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town."
We have to say good-bye... to South Park.
Who are you?
"You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier."
Hey! Where's he goin'?
Nawh. I'm new in town.
I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
"Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?"
Hello?
"Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?"
Get in here!
Take that wig off!  What's gotten into you?!
"What?! Noh! Uh, did I?"
"Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children."
"Of course not. Here. You children sit down,  and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.
When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen, and the two take off their clothes, that's right
And they caress and touch each other, until the part of the man grows
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot
And the man says ""I love you"" and the woman says ""hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom""
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait......and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says, ""Baby, I'm gettin' hot!""
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of..."
"Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember."
"Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!"
Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!
"Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!"
Yeah! When two women are involved.
And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
Is he ...dead?
Waait!  He's still breathin'! He's not dead.
We've got to get him to the hospital.
"Come on, children!"
Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to...  Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?
What? We have to get to the hospital.
"Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?"
"Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor!"
Doctor!
Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!
Whoa!
Wait a second. They've closed the pass??
What do you want me to do?
I used to watch Quincy.
So how do we get to it?
The power!
"You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--"
Ooohhh.
He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.
What???
"You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!"
"Hello there, children."
Bad.
"Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?"
Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!
Right. But do you know why they're bad?
And do you have any idea what that means?
"Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?"
Okay.
"Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!"
Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
Oh boy. Here we go again.  Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
"No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body."
That's right.
"A ""fireman""?"
"Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?  Ask your parents for once!"
"Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball!"
So let's have half the children on this side  and half the children on that side.
Play ball!
"Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh."
Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall!
"Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!"
"Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team."
"That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office."
"Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on."
Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!
"You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!"
"That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do!"
"Okay children.  Now, who's gonna win the State Finals?"
"Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
I think we need to get off on this exit."
But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!
"How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!"
"Yes, ma'am."
"I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows."
Yeah.
"Dammit, come on!  Somebody catch the ball!"
"Great job, children! Just stay focused now."
"Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip!"
"You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions."
"We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!"
"Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!
Ooo, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red"
"How much further is Washington, D.C.?"
"I need to know how far it is, lady!"
"Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat hog."
"I said, ""I've always wanted to visit Prague."""
"Damn, man. This is the big time, alright."
"You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese."
What?
Yeah.
"What? We did it! Children, we won!"
"Okay, children, back in the bus."
"Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game."
"Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions."
"And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?  Just imagine: a big yellow ""Dodgeball Champions"" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!"
"You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!"
"Hey, hey hey!  Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity."
"No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country."
"All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!"
Holy crap..!  God damn...
"Oh, what have I done?  You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good.  If we had won the world championship, what then?  It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.  Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?  Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home."
"Shut up, Pip."
"Baby, you know you're the girl for me-eeAnd all that I want to be-ee-ee is... You and meAnd her; simultaneousYou and me, and you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three; simultaneousOoh, that's right... Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what? A giant snake? Killing everybody?! Growing bigger?! Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, futch ya. Simultaneous, you and meAnd you and youSimultaneous lovin', babyTwo or three..."
"Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..?"
"Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!"
"Hello there, children!"
"Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!"
"They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, ""Fudge 'Ems"""
"I can just see the commercial now. ""Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."""
"And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, ""Fudge This."""
"Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, ""Go Fudge Yourself,"" or my all-natural, ""I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."""
Huh?
Whose goose?
"Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! ""I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"""
"Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, ""Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls."""
Try 'em.
"Hey, everybody, have you seen my balls? They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up, just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em..."
"It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!  I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it."
There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.
"Come on, Kyle. It's time to go."
"Well, uh-I kinda hope not.  I mean, sure it does.  Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.  Come on, let's go."
My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!
You're daaamn right.
"Well, it worked once before."
"Oh, damn it, not now!  Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!"
What makes you think I would know anything about that?
Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
"Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her."
"Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to."
O-kay!  Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
"Hello, children."
Welcome to the planetarium.
I love my work.
"And then, they'll ask, ""Truth or Dare?'"
"No no! You say, ""Truth."""
"You have to say ""Truth"" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager."
"You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens."
"Then, after a few ""Truth""s, you finally answer, ""Dare."""
"But not like that, son. Like this: ""Daaare""."
And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.
"Hello there, children."
What did you say?
"Eric, where did you hear that song?"
"Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas."
"Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago."
Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.
"Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all."
"Well, all right. Maybe I will go. Iâ€™ll play them my version of the song."
"So you see, Mr. Big Record Producer,  ""Stinky Britches"" was something I wrote several years ago."
Huh?
"Now, look, Iâ€™m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!"
"Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and youâ€™re gonna sue me?"
Right.
"Why ""uh-oh""?"
Uh-oh.
What?
Whoops?!
Do I look like I have $2 million?
This can't be happening..!
"Hey, that's my favorite chair!"
"Hey, children."
"Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with $2 million, I'm going to jail."
"Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better."
Sure. Just please stop.
This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.
"Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women."
Nothing.  Anyway--
Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!
But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!
"That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that $2 million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!"
Watch me. Now get the fudge out of my house!
"Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran.  Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million."
"Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them."
"I appreciate that, children,  but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do.  My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.  Wish me luck, children."
"Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up."
"Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics."
What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.
"And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know; some slick glasses and shit."
"No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?"
I have a lo-o-o-o-o-ong way to come to go to raise the kind of money I need.
"There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image."
"Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name."
"That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf."
"Uh-uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree. How would you like to use someâ€¦ sex toys?"
"Like this very special device.  I call it ""Chefâ€™s pleasure bag""."
"Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure."
"Ahh, yeah. That's much better."
I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.
I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it.
"It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail."
Huh?
Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?
Oh.
"I made about $410,300, but--"
"Goodbye, children. Thanks for all your help."
Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!
Ow! (whack) Ow!
"You finally snapped, huh, Garrison?"
"Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies."
What?!
"No, Garrison! Shut the hell up!"
What the..?
How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?
What the hell is this?
"Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?"
I donâ€™t believe it!
You will?
"It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children."
Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
"Hello there, children!"
"All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries."
Or haaauuunted hash browns.
"And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!"
And a teeeeerrifying napkin!
What?!
"Well, what's the first problem?"
"Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem?  Oh, nohoho.  Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!"
Exactly what do you remember?
Of course! That's it!
"Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!"
"Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!"
How do you mean?
"What the-?  Oh, what now?!"
"Children, what the hell are you doin'?"
You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.
"Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out."
It's really gonna piss you off.
This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.
"Oh! Hello there, children!"
Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.
"Well, it's true."
"Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off."
"No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked."
"Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years  and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself."
"Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica."
"Children, Veronica is moving in with me."
I'm in love.
Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
"Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too."
We have a chance to find the sunshine.
"Hello there, children."
"Eric, you got glasses!"
Huh?
You bet!
"Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old."
Why not??
"Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day."
That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?
"Oh! Uh, hello there, children."
"Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot."
Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing.
"Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married."
"My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too."
"If we can hold on through the night.
We have a chance to find the sunshine."
"Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back."
"It's okay, pop."
What?!
"All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!"
"No buts, Stan!  I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party."
Iii do!
Children! You are screwing up my wedding!
What the-?!
What the-?!
"No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her."
"Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream."
"Hello there, children!"
How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots?
"Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week: Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think it can't get any better.But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.And then you're left with nothing, cause your tinking with your dong.&lt;p&gt;So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon wind!Just play it cool and don't be a fool..."
"Daaamn right, Garrison!"
And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up!
"Hello there, children!"
How's it going?
"Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes."
"Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut."
"I don't know, children.  Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?"
"Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge."
"Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out."
Is everybody okay?
What the...?
"Well, I must say I still don't get this at all."
"Father, why did you go to all this trouble?"
Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?
"Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!"
"Oh, hello Stan."
How's it going?
Why bad?
"Well, sure.  Now, what's the matter, little cracker?"
"OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly."
"Your little girlfriend, Wendy."
"Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?"
"Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you."
"Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby.
Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby.
Ooo yeah, yes yes baby
Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now
Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby!
Ewww, baby! No, no!
Alright nowâ€”I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay.
Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.
Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?"
...Is that what I said?
Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.
"We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, ""What's the meaning of life?"" or ""Why are we here?""."
"Hello there, children."
"Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that."
Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!
"Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were-  Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!"
That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs.
Uh?
You're not?
"Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never mind."
"Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up."
"Hello there, children."
How's it goin'?
Everything's fine?? Why??
What??
So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!
"Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!"
"Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects."
"Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin."
"I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape."
"Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee."
What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!
"Awww, fudge it!"
The what?
Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?
Oh my God!!
That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!
"Hey, open this damn door."
Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!
I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.
"All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!"
"You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!"
That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!
"Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!"
Then we need an antidote!
"Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick!"
Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children.
"Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me."
"Come on, drink it down. It's free."
"Drink this, Eric.  God help me! Heh, get it...  She's gone! Thank God!"
I think it's working.
"Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!"
That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!
You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!
Yeah!
"Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!"
"Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag!  You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved!  Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?"
"Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion.  That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!"
"That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?"
"Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?"
Fine! Next Sunday!
Monday??
"Okay! On Saturday, we march!"
To bring down the South Park Flag!
"My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam."
"From now on, my name is  Abdul Mohammed Jabar  Rauf Kareem Ali.  With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!"
You WHAT?!  You don't think they should change the flag?!
"Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!"
"But nothin'!  ""But"" my ass! Fix your own damn food!"
Change the flag!
Change the flag! Change the flag!â€¦
"â€¦Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag!  In the 1960s there was a monk  who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice!  To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing!"
Change the flag!
"No, damnit!"
How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!
"Aw, the hell with all of you indecisive bastards!"
I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass!
Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!
"I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!"
"Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people."
Ooooooohhh?!
But that's a black man up there!
"Well of course it matters when-  â€¦Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?"
"Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard."
"Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people."
"I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist."
"Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man."
I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.
Hooray!
"Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric."
"Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out."
"Alright, Eric, what's the matter?"
"Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect."
"The law of physics that states, ""If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."""
"All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy!  Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course."
"You're welcome. Now, go away!"
A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
What's the problem?
You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.
Oooo! Call the doctor!
"Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts."
"Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', ""I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"""
"You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria."
"Hello there, children!"
"Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! ""Chef, what's the clitoris?"" ""What's a lesbian, Chef?"" ""How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?""  For once, can't you just come in here and say, ""Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?""!"
It sure is! Thank you.
Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.
Oh my God. Eric?
Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!
"Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute."
"Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services."
Like keeping you company. Understand?
"You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. 
But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children.
That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards.
That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor."
And that's why I say-
"Oohhhh  ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here!  ...These children tricked me!"
"Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children."
"Uh, from your ass, children."
Oh.
The Black Death? Are you sure?
"LaToya Jackson, children."
But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!
"It says here the word, ""shit"" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, ""skite""."
The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.
"Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse."
"Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term ""curse word"" before."
"Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and ""shit"", could be linked!"
"Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer!"
"My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about ""shit""."
Hey! Hold on a minute!
Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?
Damn cracker-ass producers!
"I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way."
Who are you?
"We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!"
'Scuse me. Do you work here?
We just need help identifying this.
"Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to."
But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.
Knights of Standards and Practices?
Oh no!
"Tonight is the ""Night of a Million Shits"" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over!"
"I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to."
"Hello, Eric!"
I made some chili to enter into the contest.
"This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?"
It's my special recipe.
"Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while."
The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.
"Hello there, children."
How is sexual education class going?
"Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life."
"...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line."
Kindergarten?!
"Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!"
"Oh, no!"
"Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved."
"Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know,  someone who has a bad opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert."
"It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17."
Seventeen.
"Nope, just 17."
Seventeen! You're ready.
"Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just-"
For what?
But... I'm not rich.
I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.
"Woo, fudge the snow now."
I shall perservere. We shall perservere.
"Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease."
"Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?"
"Hello there, children."
How's it goin'?
Yeah. Things have been better.
"Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand."
"Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power."
"Hello there, children."
Fifty pounds? Why?
"Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him."
It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.
"Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children."
"I'm runnin' out, children."
You're gonna give children AIDS?!
"Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS!"
"Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had!"
"Oh. Hello there, children."
"Uh, how's it goin'?"
"Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh?  Pretty cool, ain't it?"
"Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle.  I can't figure it out at all."
"Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure."
Why can't this guy control his temper?
"Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool feature, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here-  No, no wait. You hit this button here  No, that's not it. Let's see.  Menu...  Function"
"Let's see.  Aw, dammit!"
"I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function-  Enter? No, no. Back? H.E.M??"
"Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press ""menu,"" then ""function."""
"No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no.  Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?"
"...Yes, I pressed ""menu"" three times!  No! It's givin' me the same error message!  Yes I read the instruction manual!"
"So I'm supposed to press ""menu,"" then ""function,"" then ""enter."""
"Oh, welll, hello there, children."
"Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in.  Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on."
"Nowww, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?"
"...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?!"
"Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand  and three hundred dollars cash . It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before."
"...Wait, what? Sea people?"
"Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning."
"Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men."
"Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else.  I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher."
"Relax, children, junk that's in brine can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else."
"Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people.  Come on, children. I'll walk you all home."
"Hello there, children!"
"Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode."
Good for you!
"Hello there, children!"
Good-bah!
"Hello there, children!"
How's it goin'?
Why bad?
...Intolerant of who?
"Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children?  I thought you knew better."
"Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, ""What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?"""
"Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!"
"Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??"
You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.
"You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!"
Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!
He IS a sick queer!!
Kiss my black ass!!
"Hello there, children."
Well what's wrong with him?
"Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?"
"Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!"
Cartman?
"Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?"
"Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?"
"Ms. Cartman, we need to get Cartman to a meeting room to speak with people who have crossed over."
This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.
That's right. We have to go see him in New York.
Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.
This must be the place.
"Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you."
"Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?"
"Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!"
Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.
We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.
"Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver."
"Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now."
Hi Pop.
"These are my friends, the Cartmans."
"Hi, Momma!"
"Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman."
"Yeah, Pop. This is Eric."
The victim child?
Where were we gonna find a child to secrifice?
What do we do with it now?
"Eric, you're okay!"
"Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast?"
"Aw, damnit! Come on!  We've gotta find him! Kenny!"
"Hello there, children!"
"Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles"
"Say, did any of you children"
What the?
A repeat??
"I've been feelin' dÐ¹jÐ° vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on!"
We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.
"He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children."
That's right.
Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.
We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.
"Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum."
"Well, doctor?"
"That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!"
That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now!
"And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff."
Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.
"Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake."
"Eric, that's enough!"
"It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!"
Okay. Now it's funny again.
What's it doing?
Where is the signal being sent to?
Help!
"Get in the car, children! Get in the car!"
"Can you see anything, children?"
God damned aliens!
"Hold on, children!  We have to ditch them!"
I don't think we're outta the woods yet.
That ain't no police!
"HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you!  Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?!"
You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to...  Huh?  Aw crap! Children!
Jeff!! The aliens took the children up on their ship.
Did you find out what the aliens were up to?
"They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!"
Butt sex?
Who's havin' butt sex?
What the hell is that?!
Chaos theory??
Huh?
Oh my God! We have to stop them!
We have to find a way to stop those aliens!
Oh no.
That doesn't make any God-damned sense!
"Hello there, children!"
"I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children.  You should hang on to it."
Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park!
What do you guys think?
"I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics."
"What's all this fightin' about, children?!"
"Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too!"
"No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!"
"Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool."
"Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison."
Sure. Come on in.
"Well, what do you want me to do about it?"
"Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them."
"Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, ""I'm in the house"" instead of ""I'm here."" But then white people all started to say ""in the house"" so we switched it to ""in the hizzouse."" Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then ""in the hizzle"" which we had to change to ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" and now, because white people say ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" we have to say ""flippity floppity floop."""
Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that!
"The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?"
"Hello there, children!"
How's it goin'?
Why bad?
"No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?"
"Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out."
"Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children!"
"Oh. Hello there, children!"
"Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa."
"Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe.  Are you all okay?"
"All right. Now, where did you get served?"
"Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay.  Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it."
"Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'!"
No no no!
Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.
"Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?"
Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!
"Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??"
Oh Lord...
"All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!  We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be.  I think we should-  Whoa.  This... is the dance troupe?"
"Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do!"
"Oh Lord have mercy.  Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart.  No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent."
"All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer."
"Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit."
All right!
All right! We did it!
My God. Look at all these incredible bargains.
"Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore."
They why don't you just quit?!
"No, no, no! Let's freeze it!"
Get out! It's gonna blow!
We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns!
"Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!"
We-
Yeah. We apologize.
"Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine!"
"Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine."
...I didn't volunteer!
...Aw dammit!
I'm alive!
