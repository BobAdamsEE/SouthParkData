You did it!
I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!
"They're not better, they're just more expensive."
"Oh man, you're a lucky guy."

The gnomes!
We can do our report on the gnomes.
"The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants."
"They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever."
No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
UUuuUunh!

But we'll starve and die like dogs.
I just have grounds.
"Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!"
There they are!
"You guys, look! Look! You're missing it!"
Arrgghh! They took them again!
Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!
They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!
Uurrgh!
"Uunh, it's too much pressure!"
Waagh!

"The metaphors, man!"
Agghh!

Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
He did?
I don't have crooked teeth!
Everyone in the world?! Rrrr!

Well?

"Ah, I got rubber bands."
"Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me!  Oh Christ!  they might - could get me."
"AAHH! This is it, man! It's over!"
"What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!"
Oh man! This is too much pressure!
Aaarr!
O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it!
I can't.  You do it.
But what if I put it in the wrong place?
"GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?"
Arrrr!
"Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure!"
It's not?
Gah! Me too.
"They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!"
"Jesus Christ, we killed her!"
"Jesus Christ, she's dead!!"
"Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!"
"They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!"
What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
Rrrr-hr-hrrr!!!

"Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... ""lookout""? I won't remember ""Hammertime""!"
"Oh, God."

"You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this."
"...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!"
Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah!
"They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate."

Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.
Uh-uh huh.
"Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure."
Gaaa-hah!
NOW what's happening?
Maybe they wanna kill us.
Arr!
Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!
I'm a what??
Harrr!
"Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore."
"NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!"
I'm not! I'm not a team player!
D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!
But we don't have hats!
Aahh!
"You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??"
Fifty hats? Oh Jesus!
Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it!
Hrrr!
My center. My... center.  Calm  Cup?
Gaaaaah!
Oh God!
Aaaah! Oh God!
"You guys, we have a big problem!"
"I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!"
A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!
Goohoo!
Oh God!
"I gotta move away, you guys!"
Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!
You don't?
What?
"You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!"
Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.
"No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!"
Ga-ahah!

Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!
"Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!"
No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create!
Hwaaah!

I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.
I'm in a field... surrounded by deer.
Huh uh.
Guh huh huh!
Oh God! Oh Jesus!
Aaaaaah!
"Oh God, no! Not Plan B!"
Aaaahh!
Oh my God they're gonna kill us.
"Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president , treasurer , and secretary  have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!"
"Yes, just like hat!!"
"No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!"
No!
Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!
Hello!
"I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg!"
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.
Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
Then your premiere has no movie!
"Ah, what?!"
Oh my God!
But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?
Cartman likes to play with dolls?
You... guys wanted me to meet you here?
Oh God.
Oh God!  Change it! Change it!
"Agh! God, change it!!"
Aaaah!!
Gahahghah
Oh God. They're gonna get me.
I s-I saw! Uuuh!
Oh God! Huh!
Oh Jesus! Huh!
"No, ...NO! They're gonna get me!  GAAAH! Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God.  Uh, just a dream.  OH MY GOD!!  GAAAH!!"
...Inside my room? Oh God!
"Oh my God!  Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this.  AAAHH!"
What?
Oh God! Oh Jesus!
"Wait, that's not the usual ticket-taker guy!"
So? I don't know him!
You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!!
AAH! Uh...
Get away from meee!
"I don't know you!  Ah, AAAH!"
Huh uh!
I'm not supposed to talk to you!
But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's a pretty good trick.
AaaaAAAHH!
The Ghost of Human Kindness?
What do you want?
"Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me."
It isn't?
"I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world."
I'll... try.
Your van?
What the hell is going on?
No
I didn't mean to.
Triben fak burushban.
Conifer? Walking there would take hours!
Me too.
"Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!"
