"Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!"
"Oh, finally!"
"Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?"
"Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right?"
"Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in."
Yeah.
What's this?
"A ticket? ""Failure to care about the environment"" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!"
"You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!"
I know it's not a real ticket!!
"The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!"
And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
"There, like that! Stop that!"
"I know! It's like ""Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"""
At least we're smart enough to know better!
Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
"Yeah. Good going, stupid!"
"Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!"
Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
That's it. That's that the last one.
"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend."
"Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars."
You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
I'm...  I'm not ready...
"Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us."
STAAAN!!
"Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!!"
JUST GET THE GUN!!
"Unh, come on!"
A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character!
"SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore."
Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!
"We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead."
We're alive?? We're alive!
"Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet."
FAMILY GUY!!!  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!
"Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!"
I like the sand idea.
"It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?"
"All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole."
"Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me."
"Uhh, Stan?"
"It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?"
"Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?"
ManBearPig?
"Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention."
Stan?  Stan?
Stan!
You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?
...I'm not a r-tard.
"Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together."
"No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  ""Hello.""  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing."
What?? Why?? Why?!
"Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys?"
"Yeah, I'm playing from the office."
Yes?
That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.
Who are you?
Nn-Oh my God!
"Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?!"
Where?!
"Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!"
Give me the sword.
"I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online."
"Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works!"
Where's your car?
"Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!"
World of Warcraft! I need to play!
"Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in!"
Staaan!
Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.
"No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?"
Okay.
Augh!
Stan...
"Staaan.  I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son."
Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions!
Godspeed.
What's goin' on?
With a student? But... she's a woman.
But... she's hot.
"Yeah, she's a hot victim."
What?
Biggie Smalls?
"All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror."
I'm a geologist!
...Smalls.  No way!
"That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon!"
"Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!"
"Oh, well that's good."
"...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago."
Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
"Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!"
"What are we goin' to do, Sharon??"
Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.
"Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day."
Stan?? Shoot it!
Take the shot!! Take the shot!!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!
"OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again."
"Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago."
"Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go.  I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying ""That's my son!""  And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose."
NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO!
"Thanks, Pat!"
"Yeah, they're all rooting for me."
"Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!"
Okay.
"Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G."
An O please.
"Uh... Well, uh..."
I know it but I don't think I should say it.
"Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Niggers!  Huh?  Ohhh..."
"Oh naggers. Of course, naggers.  Right."
"Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?"
"What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money."
"I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson."
"Uh well, like anybody else thought it was ""naggers"". I mean, right?"
Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans.
"Y-Yes, absolutely."
"Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you."
Huh?
You want me to kiss your-
"Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh..."
"Hi, ""nigger"" guy!"
Yeah... No problem...
I just... need some aspirin.
Fine!
"Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say ""Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy.""  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! ""Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy!"" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just ""Nigger Guy"".  Respect."
"And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the ""nigger"" guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on ""Wheel of Fortune"", you know and... and when people call me... ""nigger guy""... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels."
"Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you!"
Awww! Awwww!
Whoa!
"Please I, I don't want any trouble."
What do you want?
What's going on here?
"No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money."
You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
No.
"Senators, I know it is not normally considered ""American"" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term ""nigger guy""."
Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
"Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called ""nigger guys""?"
We did it!
"...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade."
"Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good."
"Wha... what do you mean, ""Why do we do this?"" It's Easter!"
"Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them."
"Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins."
That's right.
"Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!"
What is wrong with him?!
You know so little!
"Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet!"
"Hang on, I'm taking a crap."
What?
"We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys."
Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
"I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!"
"We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men."
"Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand."
I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
"Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!"
"I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time."
"I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father."
Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
"You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away."
Dammit.
"Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever."
"Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!"
Just get out of here!
"Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something."
"Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?"
You...
You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
"I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore."
"No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!"
"Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!"
"Just hand over the bunny, Stan!"
"Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit."
No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
"Oh, we should've seen that coming!"
No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!  Oof.
"Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter."
That's my boy.
"Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars."
"You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA."
"No, sorry, I don't have any change."
"No, sorry."
Huh! I don't have any change.
No!
Leave me alone I don't have any change!
"Oh, now I feel bad.  Here!  Ahh!  Hahh!  Nono, that was really all the change I had."
I just gave you change!
Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange!
Waaah!  Awwww!  Stay away!  Stay awayhay!
Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!
Help! Help us!
No sign of anybody else.
"Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people."
"You won't make it through, Gerald!"
He's become one of them.
We don't have any change! Go away!
"Find another place to hide, Steve!"
There isn't enough food for more people up here!
"All right all right, fine!"
Harrrh!
"No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts."
"Face it, we're gonna starve!"
Those are cherry! Ich!
How? Call the fire department.
He's homeless now. We aren't safe.
Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
If we have to! Siddown Glen!
SIT... doowwwnnnn!
A bus! A bus is coming!
"Look, Glen. We're saved."
What are they doing?  Don't leave us!
Oh Glen! We made it!
Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!
"P.F. Chang's, mostly.  Good stuff."
"How painful is ""painful""?"
"Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot!  Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot!  Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo.  Ohhh, it's over. It's over.  Oh God.  I feel so much better. Oh.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?"
Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
"Come on! That's pretty impressive!  Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this."
Look what your old man made.
"Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?"
"I'll try, but I don't think-  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first."
Well he's gotta see this.
"No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!"
"Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard."
Hey guys!
"Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now."
Well I don't know about ever...
I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
I guess it was pretty big.
It wasn't bigger than mine was.
Mine... mine was bigger.
You wanna see it?
"Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece."
That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe.
Aw crap!
"The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder."
"Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap."
"Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning."
"Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee."
"These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans!"
Courics...
But that means...
"Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody!"
"Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!"
"I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!"
"You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning."
"Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!"
"You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!"
"Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me!"
Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
What?
Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
"Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!"
I would need a lot of help.
I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!
Oooooo.
"Can I, can I see it?"
Ahhh...
In Zurich?
I can't do it! I can't do it!
"But then, does it still count?"
No... Nooo...
I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon?
"I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono."
"Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot"
"Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better."
"Sharon, what are the boys doing?"
They can play guitar now?
Ohhh.
Hey yeah...
"So you boys like this music, huh?"
"Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. 
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-"
I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
But... But this is real.
You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller!
No way!
"Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh."
"Hang on, I almost caught the dragon."
I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
"This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff."
Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
"Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?"
She's such a train wreck!
"Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug."
"For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it."
"We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest."
"Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone."
An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
Looks like next harvest will be even better.
Let's hear it for Gerald!
And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway.
"Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone."
"But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-"
One more thing?  Ooooyeah...
"Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer!"
"My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?"
What?!
"I know that, okay?!"
"Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC."
Gerald. Please help us.
Our house... It has no Internet.
We've got nothing! It's just gone.
Thank you Gerald.
Oh no you're not!
What?!
"It's not working, Gerald."
"Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!"
"Right, Starbucks!"
No! Nobody's is!
Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
"God, the whole neighborhood's affected."
"Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store."
How do you know?!
"Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!"
A television!
"Jesus, it's statewide."
Jesus... we're all alone...
"I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't."
"Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!"
You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
"Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!"
"Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go."
How. You won't have Internet.
Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
"I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away."
Sure will be nice.
That's right. We need to get online.
"Come on, Stan, let's get some rest."
"Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee!"
Do they have Internet here?
Marsh.
NetZero.
So is there Internet here?
"Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet."
Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
"Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way?"
"Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody."
"Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time."
I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
"You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!"
Three minutes would be plenty.
Ohhh.
"Yeah, how'd you know?"
"I know, right?"
"""Internet Porn Simulator"""
"Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!  Damn it.  Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click.  Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.  Bestiality? Click, click on that.  Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click!  Dahya.  No. No, this isn't gonna work.  It's just not the same."
Well at least that part's like the Internet.
Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Japanese girls puking each other's mouths.
Oh niice... Whoa...
"Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh!"
Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh!
"Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!"
"Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost!"
"And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max."
"All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner."
There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?
"Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan."
"Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot."
"There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?"
Huh?
"That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting!"
"Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon."
Ohhh this is good!
"Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday."
What the hell was that?
"Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here!"
"Get back to your room, Shelly!"
What's going on?
What are?!
What did that?!  What is that thing?!
Oh my Gohhhd!
"Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled."
HAAA!
Oh God.  I'm-  I'm so-  Startled.  ARRRGH!
"I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly."
I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.
"Jesus, this thing is worldwide?"
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
Gotta get out!
"Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!"
We've got to get out of town. Go through that way.
Oh Jesus!
"Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!"
"In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?"
"Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside."
Here we see a view from outside the bus.
"I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon."
"All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters."
"That's a that's a, that's a new sound."
"Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs."
Oh no! Oho oho.
"Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!"
We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.
I'm so startled.
"Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?"
You can't help him!
"No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid!"
"It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  There. There. Okay. Gaaah!"
"Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah!"
"It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say ""hey"" guys."
"I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside!"
What is it?
"Oh no, I'm way too startled!"
"Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?"
"Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday."
"Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it."
Yyeeaahh!!!!  Obama!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
"Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!"
He's so awesome!  He's so perfect and awesome!
Yes I can! Yes I can!
Here comes the change everybody! WOOO!
This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
I know what to do!  Losers! Looosers!
WOOOO Obama!
O ba ma! O ba ma!
Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on!  It's Obamobama!
"Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!"
BOOOO!
What are you? A McCain voter?
"Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Obama! Obama!"
"Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car!"
"O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama!"
"Wooo, change."
Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.
"We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore."
"Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss!"
"Yeah, you know what? Fuck you!"
"You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!"
"It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!"
Obama's not talkin' about you!
"Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'."
"Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!"
"Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain!"
"Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money."
"Go on, Stanley."
Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
"I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son?"
"There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!"
"Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea."
"We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!"
"We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want."
"I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan."
Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
What?!
"Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?"
"We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?"
"That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!"
What is this? What's going on?
What's he doing?
But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
"Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! ""Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom."" Oh, we need this!"
"Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight."
"A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today."
Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
"I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody."
"Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again."
"The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again!"
What does that have to do with anything?
What was that?
"Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?"
"Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?"
"Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!"
"Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?"
Sharon! Marsh!
"That's it, I'm leaving!"
That's completely different!
"Heh, yeah?"
Yeah?
"Come on Stanley, let's go."
"It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon!"
"I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker  And then there's The Foghorn  and the ""Don't be scared""  and of course there's the-"
Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker!
Jesus Christ!
"Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!"
Alright son! Yeah!!
"HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!"
Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...
"Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan."
"Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right."
There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
"Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan."
We know!
"Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!"
"That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast."
"Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There."
"It's, uh it's nothing, really."
"Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about ""tells."""
"When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear."
"Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son."
"Yes I do, yes I do."
Oh! Yes!
"Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?"
One point five?
"Come on, Stan, you can do this!"
"Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!"
"Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!"
"Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh."
"What?  Hey, hey Sharon."
"So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space."
"Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?"
Hullo?
"Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing."
"That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan."
He's got a gun!
What do you want?
"Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy."
"Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son."
We're working on it!
"Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that."
Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!
Hello?
Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
Awhuh.
What?!
"Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything."
"Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax."
"Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?"
"No, we're sure."
"That's right, yep, you're the first ones."
"...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!"
We will give you a call!
"Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before."
"Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!"
"No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien."
"Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck."
"Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look."
"Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!"
You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
"But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again."
Oh my God. Spaaace caaash.
Right.  But what if we didn't call the cops?
"Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it."
"Will you relax, Stan?"
"Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son!"
"Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers."
"Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him."
Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.
"Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?"
"Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here."
Probably.
"Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks."
Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
"No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!"
Nobody can build anything!!
Wha?! Finland?!
"Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything."
"Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?"
"All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland."
Oh dammit!
"Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?"
Whaa-wha-what about it
"Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland."
"Hey guys, Finland's dead."
"Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close."
"No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide."
"Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'."
Stan?
"Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son."
"Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?"
"Yeah, no, we've told you everything."
"Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!"
It was... a trick?
"No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!"
"Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?"
MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!
Hey pal.  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.
"Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   And you always have your neat picture."
"Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us."
Isn't this great food?
"You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-"
Fags!
"Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots!"
"I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?"
What's going on?
"Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?"
Oh my God. I've gotta help him!
You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
"It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!"
"Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died."
"I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants."
"Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors."
I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me.
"Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah."
"Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww."
"No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay."
Stan!
"Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother."
Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
"Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you?"
Read what?
So?
Huh?
"""It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-"" Ew, Sharon, gross!"
"""He took a- and then-"" Oh, man. Oh, this-"
"Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!"
"""Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-"" What? ""He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-""  ""That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest."" Oh... Oh, man."
It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
"No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!"
"NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff."
Butters? Is that true?
"Ohkay boys, you already told the truth."
"Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?"
"Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on."
"Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?"
"Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?"
"Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!"
My huh?
"Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back!"
"KFC's gone, been replaced."
Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor.
I gotta get to the doctor!
All right!
That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
"Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed."
But you said I'm totally healthy!
"...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?"
"Yeah, but what's the quickest way?"
"Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?"
"Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay."
"""Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers."" Alright.  ""Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are...""  ""slow-growing and can take years to develop."" Dammit.  ""Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive."" Oh this is good. ""There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation"" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?"
"Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!"
SCORE!
"Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!"
"Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival..."
"One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!"
Uh that is nice! That is nice!
"I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?"
"Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer!"
"Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho."
Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
"No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer."
"Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em."
"Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going ""whaaa?"" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies."
See?
Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
"Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?"
Hey. My eyes are up here.
"It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe."
"Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?"
"Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?"
Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
What do we want?
Where do we want them?
What do we want?
Where do we want them?
"Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls."
"Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir."
And when it gets cold it shrinks.
"Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?"
Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
"...Oh okay.  So I'm, m not your friend then?"
"...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?"
"Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?"
"Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?"
Oh cool! Okay.
Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
"That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it."
Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
"Stan, poke your grandma!"
Yahtzee!
"Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?"
"Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?"
"You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!"
"Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!"
"Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments."
"Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box..."
"We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages..."
"Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says ""Fred's Fudge and Candies""... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again."
ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.
"Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you."
That's... tricky...
"Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-"
"Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park."
"Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today."
"Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad."
"Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo."
"Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes?"
"Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this."
"Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again."
What the hell was that?!
"Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved."
Helllo?
"Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you."
"There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us."
"Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise."
"Well, yeah."
"Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators."
"Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you."
"Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume?"
"Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?"
"Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!"
We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
I don't really work out.
"People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands."
"More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey."
"Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own."
"Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?"
"Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!"
"Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!"
"Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!"
"There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help."
We could ask Al Qaeda.
Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
People from Jersey?
What is it?
That thing is famous? Why?
Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?!
"Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this."
"Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!"
What does that mean?!
Stop playing stupid!
Nobody's this stupid!  What are you people planning?!
Yup. They're from Jersey alright.
This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey!
"Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!"
Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
"It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda!"
"On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, ""Go away!"" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden."
"On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences."
We got him!
"Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now."
What does that mean?
What?!
"Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?"
"What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!"
That does it!
"I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!"
Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!
I said get me in there!
Ahhh.
Stan?  Stan!
"Yes, it's me, Stan."
It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly!
I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
"I was gonna, but oh! This is fun!"
"Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon."
Aah ahhh aha ahhh.
"Aw, dammit."
"Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?"
It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
"I mean, hello!"
"Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace."
What the hell is that?  Who put that there?
I don't know.
I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools.
"Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time."
"Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!"
"Psseh... huh...  Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot...  Oh yeah. Fuck."
"Mmm, God damn. Yeah."
"Yeah, it's fuckin' money."
Aw yeah?
Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah.
"Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!"
"Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww..."
No!
"Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up."
Daddy time. It's Daddy TV time.
"Aw yeah, look at that."
I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
"Oh my God that's awesome! Oh...  Oh, oh.  ...Yeah. Whoa."
"See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo."
"Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!"
"Aww, stupid commercials."
Come on!
Bohh-riiing.
"Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm."
"Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?"
I wasn't watching food channels!
I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw!
Crème fraîche.
"Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?"
Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
Yeah?
You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?
"If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan."
Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
WAH! Sharon!
"Hello there, children!"
How's it goin'?
The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
"I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche."
"Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli."
"Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah."
"Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche."
"Aww, fuck yeah."
"Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh..."
Fraîche.
"Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh..."
"Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah."
"Quiet on set, please."
Back from where?
"Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!"
Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!
Yes chef!
"No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!"
"Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!"
"Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes!"
Jamie Oliver!
Behind you!
"Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home!  I'll be right back!"
"Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?!  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!"
"Oh, thank God!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??"
I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
"You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!"
"I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!"
"Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah!  Now uh, switch arms.  Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this?  You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time.  Ugh, I'm tired."
"Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?"
"I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Love you, Sharon."
Oh dear.
Did they measure from the base or from the balls?
I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.
"Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you."
"Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids."
"And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there."
"...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud"
Four point four inches...
Seven centimeters...
"Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person ""Randy"" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average."
Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE
"Aw, suck it! All o'ya!"
You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!
"No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!"
Yeeaahh!
Yeeaahh!
Burn it down!
Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express!
This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!
"We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-"
"Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!"
"Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!"
And we want-
"Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,"
"Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?"
"Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!"
"No. No, that doesn't matter!  Fuck, really?!"
Rrrr!
"The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!"
"America is back!
America is back!"
"We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!"
"Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!"
Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
"Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?"
Tween Wave?
"Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?"
...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
"""Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber."""
"I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool."
Uh... NO I mean...  I like it.
"No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon."
It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome!
"Ugh, that's so unfair!"
Yeah it's good!
"Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us."
What?
Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh.
"That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!"
Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
"Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!  I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow  I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga."
"No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old!"
"City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much"
"City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks."
Yoyoyo!
"You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!"
"I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!"
"I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!"
Why can't you ever just support me?!
"Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!"
"Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time!"
I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
You kind of seem shitty to me too.
"It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the ""government"" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a ""mentally incapacitated"" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!"
"Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!"
"We worked it out, pal. Surprise!"
"Well, I think it's good.  If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy.  NOOOOOO!"
"I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?"
You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
A musical?  Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical!
What?
Nuh uh.
Noh uh.
Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
Oh. Wicked.
"Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?"
"Okay, I'll be right back.  'Scuse me, sorry."
Can I get a scotch and soda?
"Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected."
"To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening."
Subliminal messages?
"Whoa, no way!"
"You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!"
"She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes."
"Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it."
"Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something."
"Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now."
Really??
"Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?"
I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
"Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!"
"It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is ""Wicked"" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times."
Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
"Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town."
"And hold!  Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there.  Uhh, this better be important."
"Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it!"
"Not much, sup with you guys?"
"Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs."
My musical has lots of subtext.
And then she does. It's a metaphor.
Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
"Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!  And now I need to get back to rehearsals.  Oh. And if ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party."
"Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?"
Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down!
Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down!
Whassup brah?!
Sup brah?!
"Right here, brah!"
What makes you the brauthority brah?!
What brah?!
What brah?! What brah?!
"I do respect you, bro!"
"I do respect you, bro!"
"I respect you, bro!"
Okay!
"Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!"
"Hey, really??"
"Oh, that is beautiful!"
Bro'dwaaay!
Ooof.
"Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys."
"Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it."
"Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?"
Alright babe.
Okay. What's Shelly doing?
She's WHAT?!
OH!  Shelly! Hold on!
"AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see ""Wicked""?!"
She's too young for that stuff!
This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
I can't!
"Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext."
"D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw ""Wicked""?"
"And after ""Lion King"" in New York? ""Godspell""? ""Mamma Mia""?"
Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
"No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry."
AAAA!
Shelly!
"Shelly? Shelly?  Shelly, come on. We have to go!"
"Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!"
Oh you fucking pervert!
Shelly!
It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all!
Sorry! Sorry.
Agh!
"Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you."
"It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy!  I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you.  I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad."
Really?
"Oh Sharon, you're the best."
"I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier."
"Aw, damn it.  He, hey officer."
"Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh..."
"Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!"
I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick.
Yeah thanks.  Asshole.
"No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work."
Yeah yeah.
So ridiculous.
Thanks.
"Hey, what's that thing?"
"Aw, you people have me on camera now?"
"Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?"
"Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA."
What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
It is time for us all to grow up.
It is time for a sue-ance.
"Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off."
That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.
"Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea."
Just trying to leave without being rude.
"Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?"
Six thousand?!
"Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!"
BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!
That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
"All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays."
Huh?
"Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!"
"Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?"
"Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!"
"Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric!"
"Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!"
"Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it ""sarcastaball""?!"
"Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!"
"Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool."
"Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it."
How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
"Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back!"
"Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer!"
"Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!"
"Yeah, no, you nice going!"
"Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt!"
"Oh yeah, good one!"
"Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!"
YEAH!  YEAH! WOO!
"Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared."
"Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!"
...Yeah...
"All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow."
"That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better."
That's IT!
"Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show."
"Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this."
Thanks Jim.
"Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?"
"Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!"
"Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!"
"Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me."
"Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better."
So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too!
"No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse."
My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
"Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much!"
STAN?! Stan!
"Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!"
"Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!"
"Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!"
"Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!"
I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
... This is cum.
Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football.
Ohhhh...
"Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?"
"Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?"
"No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it."
"Oh, is that so?"
"Sure um... Chad, is it?"
"Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?"
Yeah I'll bet.
"Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you."
"Yeah, w-what are they?"
You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?
"Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got."
"Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit."
How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?
You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?
You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.
"Oh no, pull in here."
"Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun!"
Thought we wouldn't find out???
Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.
Huh? Nothing.
"Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?"
"And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks."
Oh my God!
We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
This guy doesn't know when to quit!
"Sorry sorry, that's me.  Hello?"
"Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke."
"Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is."
Yours? What?
It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
Hellooo family!  Who wants champagne?
"It's finally happened, Sharon!  I did it!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous."
"And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now."
I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video!
"Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?"
"You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition."
"Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?"
Well? There she is.  It's a new beginning for us!
Shelly come on!
"Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?"
"Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it."
"You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS."
"How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?"
"Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly."
"Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?"
Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore!  People just don't know we're open yet!
Little fucking pricks.
"Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something?"
"Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-"
"Oh. Oh I get it!  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!"
"Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!"
"I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!"
"Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  ""Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!""  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!"
"Hey, whoa, what are you doing?"
"Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night!"
"Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!"
You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing  and candy corn . This is the night we turn it all around.
"Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!"
"Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!"
"Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau!"
They'll come!  Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
"Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?!  It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies!  What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple.  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!"
I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
"No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak."
He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan.
"According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option."
"Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?"
"Okay.  STAN!  STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'!"
Who are you people?! You aren't real!
Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  I got a little somethin' for all of you!  Run! You'd better run!
Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
Haarrrr!
Raaaawr!
Streaming Halloween 4! Hahaha!
AAAAA!  AAAAA!
"Arrrg!  Hey, what are you doing?!"
"Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan!  Stan!"
No...
Yeah...
Okay...
Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange.
Oh I feel like such an idiot.
"But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today."
All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now.
"Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  Come on it.  Oh hey Stan, what's up? "
"...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show."
"Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff."
Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
Oh yeah!  Three of the best shows in a row!
"Yeah, I got lube right here."
Yeah-hah! 
"What the?  What the hell?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says ""How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?"" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?"
Stan. Stan!  How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?
What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
"Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!  I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot!  Stan?  You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! "
"It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!  What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?"
"What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!"
"Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!"
"Oh. Well okay, great."
"NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!"
I can't afford DirecTV.
"No, just the usual cable-company stuff."
"I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off."
Hi. Corey Lanskin?
We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
"Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!"
We have a hundred ounces of silver. 
"Why, why would we punch trees?"
Watching informative murder porn?
"Puh, punching trees?"
"Oh, I see. So when does the game start?"
...I don't get it.
"Yes ah, I'm getting it now."
No.
"I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one."
"Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond."
"No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?"
"Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back."
Yes?
"No, what happened?"
"Punched his trees, huh?"
Huh.  That's weird.
I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
"Will do, officer. Will... do... "
"Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!"
"Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!"
I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off!  Oh crap.
"Sharon, I'm I'm sorry. "
"No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us."
"Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?"
"It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you. "
Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
"Oh yeah? What's that?  AAAGH!  Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!"
"Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!"
Felt great?
"Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now."
That felt so good!
"Okay, hang on."
"Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now."
"OH! Ohoho, you bitch!  Ohohunh."
I love you too babe.  OH!
I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
"Hey,  that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?  Oh, thanks!  Gets a little boring around here, you know? "
So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? 
Is it really as bad as they say it is?
"Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.  Please to put a penny in the old man's-"
"Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash."
"I did, Sharon.  I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money."
"Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!"
"Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.  Bzzz bzzz. "
"Morning, Joe, Marcus."
What is it?
"Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both."
Whoa! Haha.  Yes sir!
"No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh."
"You-d, you do?"
Yeah... awesome...
"Alright, listen up.  The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.  It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.  Augh! Hold on! Oh God!"
No! 
No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!
"No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday."
Get back inside. We have work to do. 
Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
Everybody stay put! I'll handle this. 
"If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving."
"Well, you're about to be."
You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
Smartasses. 
"My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us.  Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!"
"Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!  Stay tough, rookie."
"We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!"
OKAY?!
Not one more good person dies on my watch! 
Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!
Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!
"What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé!  I've gotta save them!"
Get back! Get out of my way!  Commander Marsh?
"WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM!"
"Stan! You're alive! I saved you!  It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! "
"Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!"
"Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no."
What is that supposed to mean?
"Yes, Freemium gaming."
I love Candy Crush.
"Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up."
And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
"You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow."
If she means that much to you.
How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
"Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work."
No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
"No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models."
"Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you."
Fuck you! 
They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
"Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something."
"Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!  Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya.  Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy.  Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya.  And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh.  Oh God. Sorry.  Uh hold on. Hang on, uh. "
"Sorry folks, just one second here."
"Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Okay, uh, uh...  Oooo! Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! "
"Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! "
"Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Great, thanks.  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?"
I was told to!
"Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! "
"Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?"
"Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-"
This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. 
I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
I'll do no such thing!
You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
Sharon? Sharon!
"They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!"
The hologram's in our bedroom?
You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!
"Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?"
A startup company? A company that does what?
"Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name."
Make your dick fly off?
What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?
Hamburger Helper?
"There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!"
"Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!"
"This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!"
Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!
"Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!"
"You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!"
"All right, come on!"
You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah!
Yes?
Gluten expohn... oh not here!
Wuh sure!
Well that's just a beer.
"Shuut up,  beer is bad for you?!"
"Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?"
No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
How long do I have to stay here?!
What am I supposed to eat?
Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.
Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
"I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?"
"How's your mom? Your, your sister?"
"That's my son, you bastard!"
Staaan!
Staaaaaaan!
You can't just keep us in here!
They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them.
Are you crazy?
"Oh my God, you...  but... you're okay."
"Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out."
Ng-oh.
"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah."
"We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah."
Aaah I don't know. Why?
In my jeans?
...Yeah. I do.
"Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel."
You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
Every time?
Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup.
Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.
"I, I, thought you were at the grocery store."
"Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah."
"Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Coming."
"Shelly, that's enough time on your phone."
You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know.
Oh really? About... about what?
"Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde."
"It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down."
"Yah, that's my cover."
"Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go ""Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games."" But they just- do what they want with my songs."
"Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  ""Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn""  ""Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."""
"Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  ""Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter.""  Stan?"
"You wanted to see me, boss?"
Hi Carol.
"Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined."
"I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music."
With what?  With what?
"It's okay, it's gluten free."
I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde.
Wacky Races?! Holy shit!
I know! Are we watching at your house?!
"All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today."
Geez!
Did you see that?! Oh!
Ohh! Ohh! Duuude!
Oooo! Booom!
"Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.  Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. "
Eeww.
It's simple.
"Oh yeah, this is gonna work great. "
"Heheh, Gerald is watching Housewives of Atlanta."
I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  Oh shit!  Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!  I've been shot!  No! Noooo!
I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
Okay.
No. I didn't. 
What might be?
...Drones are spooky?
"You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! "
"You didn't realize! What are ""Canadian coins""?"
"Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!"
How?!
"Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!  I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa."
Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?
"I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop."
"Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.  Come on Dad, we're going home."
Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
"I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  It's called a tasting, and it's classy!"
"All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.  HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*"
"What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!"
"$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!"
"Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!"
"You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!"
"I am not chugging beer!  I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! "
Oh pass interference! Interference! 
Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. 
What are you gaywads doin'?
"Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. "
"It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse."
You guys wanna put some money on it? 
"Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!"
"It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college."
"Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely."
Oh? Not impressed? How about this?
Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!
"Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey!"
"All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback."
"Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college."
"Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer."
"People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Oh my gosh!"
"Hey kids, are we having fun?  Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat?"
"Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic...  you'll find that-  Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!"
"Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you!"
"Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing.  Whatever you believe is real, is real."
"Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?"
"Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?"
"All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir?"
"Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it."
"Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde."
No! That was a copy of me!
"Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!"
"Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde."
Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
A holiday special. Oh my God.
I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special!  Can you help me stop them?!
Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.
"We don't really use this thing anymore.  It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!"
Oh my God...
My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.
I guess... one step at a time.
"Shelley? Um, I'm Lorde.  All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. Whew, that was hard."
"I don't think so, you son of a bitch! "
Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS!
THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!  SHIT!! 
"What the heck is this?  Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, good. Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? … Uh huh … Uh huh … Let me check  Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano!"
"Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt."
"Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here."
"Mayor, I might have an idea."
"If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park, pretty much completely."
Uh - pretty sure.
And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
Uhh...
"Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?"
Huh?
"Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions."
"How's it feel to be 102, paps?"
"Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grampa."
Me.
"Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh,"
"Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison."
"Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh."
Did you turn the heat down?
"Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather."
"Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won."
"Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?"
"Uhh, yes, Officer?"
"Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour."
Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
"Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.  Ow!"
"Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!"
Ooww!
"Damn it, stop.  Oh!  Damm it!"
How do we get our runaway children back?
"Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.  Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. 
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold"
"Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early."
"Yeah, it's-it's true, he is."
We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
"See ya, son."
Doctor?
Wh-where's Stan?
"Stan, our son?"
Will he be okay out of the hospital?
"Okay, well well, let's go look--"
I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
Stan?
Stan?
"Stanley, where the hell have you been?"
"Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital."
What?
"Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?"
I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
Uh oh!
"No, I was just uh flipping through the channels."
Okay.
"Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?"
How do you think I met your mother?
"Oh, brother."
"Yeah, Stanley, you should know better."
"Okay, okay."
"Give me a second, would you?"
I didn't snap at you.
Whatever.
"I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry."
Uh I think I found it.
"Hey, back off, cunt!"
Did I?
"Stanley, I... Skylarkings?"
"Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school."
"You need to shape up, mister."
I don't interrupt you.
"Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!"
When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
"Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say."
"Oh, please!"
"No, she is."
"Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up."
"Well, hello, ladies."
"I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more."
"Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what."
"Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day."
"Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.  You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?"
"Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party."
"I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse."
"Oh, maybe it was."
I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
Sharon?
Truth or Dare?
"No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?"
Do you still love me?
"Well, you never know. Maybe--"
--thing will work out.
Dare.
"Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning."
"Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity."
"Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch."
"Hey, why is the basement door locked?"
Sharon?
There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
"Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?"
What is it?
"Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?"
"I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore."
"Uuuh, do you want your pants back?"
"Eh, it's fine with me."
"Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something."
Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.
"...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist."
"Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth."
Wow.
Or else what?
"Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no."
"Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else."
Exactly.
Right.
"It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?"
New girlfriend?
Maybe nothing...  maybe everything.
"Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?!"
"All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Now, walk.  Do you feel hot?"
Damn it! How come you're not combusting?
No! Has she been doing anything odd?
Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
No! I think I might have it.
"Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust."
"Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Girlfriend ==&gt; DEADBoyfriend ==&gt; DEAD Call a town meeting tomorrow."
Wow.
"The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long."
Exactly.
"I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now."
"Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!"
"You wanted to see me, Mayor?"
I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.
"Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems."
Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.
"Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly."
"Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?"
Stan?
Awww crap.
"Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere."
Hey!
"Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution."
"Mr. Garrison, help me!"
I-I don't know what to say.
"Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me."
Hm. Really?
"Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me."
What?
"You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book."
"All right. Now, let's get to work."
Wow!
"...Right, right right."
"Uh. Please, everyone-"
"Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer."
"It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny."
"I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow."
"No problem, Jakov."
"Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?"
"Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov."
"Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time."
"Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it."
"Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him."
"Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time."
"We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan."
"One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little."
"Yeah, experiment."
"Hell, we should get in."
"I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo!"
"Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?"
"I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things."
Good idea.
"Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me."
"Huh? Oh, you mean, this?"
"Yeah. That, that was me."
"Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot."
"O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that."
With two girls or two guys?
"You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have."
"No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?"
"Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?"
...Well it is a night for experimenting.
"Okay, I'll start."
...Yeah.
"No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?"
"Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing."
Um... Yeah yeah sure sure.
"Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?"
"Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself."
"Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida."
Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
Okay.
I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
"I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody."
"Well, of course we wouldn't."
"Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?"
What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
"Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody!"
AAAW!!
Who?!
"Who who did you hear is, is gay?!"
Oh.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
There's nothing to talk about.
"No, I-... I don't know."
No!
Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
"Aaww!  Sharon?  Sharon, cuh can we go?"
"Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now."
"Ogh, I already did."
"Not now, Stanley."
"Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?"
"We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay!"
"God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows."
What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
"It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub!"
"Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!"
You mean it? I'm not gay?
"Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!"
"Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!"
What are you doing?
Why?
...Are those good moral values?
"I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all."
"Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent."
"My God, you're right."
"Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys."
"Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!"
"Well, I guess that settles that."
Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo!
"Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!"
"Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker.  Isn't that cool?"
"Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves."
"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over."
"Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?"
Lynch mob!
Here's their van! Here's their van!
KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
"Uh, look, Mr...."
"Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own."
"Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once."
Uhwhy do we want to all chaperone the dance?
"Alright, alright, that's enough, boys."
Let's bring those Confederate bastards down!
"Alright men, fire!"
"Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down."
Yeh-hah!
He took the bell!
Ow! That hurt!
Oh?
"Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!"
"Alright, alright. We surrender."
"Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment."
All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
Huh?
"Well, the Union be damned!"
"Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!"
WHERE?!
"Come on, boys!"
"Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!"
We're out of s'more schnapps?
"Oh, my head."
"Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us."
Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
"Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff."
"Ey, that sounds fun."
What was that??
A whole year?
"Yeah, with our own eyes."
We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
That's God?
"Okay, is everyone ready to go?"
"You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley?"
You're from Cirque du Cheville.
Well...
"Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!"
"Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping."
Huh?
"Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman?  Ma'am?"
"No, Dad."
"No, Dad, she's dead!"
It looks like she had a heart attack.
...Ew!
"Uh, girls, we... have some bad news."
"Um...  Everyone who has a grandma, step forward.  Uh, not so fast, girls."
"Well, Stan, it's not really our-"
What?
Uh-oh.
I don't know.
That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.
"Stan, we-"
"I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls."
"Oh, shi-"
"Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it."
"Wasn't that great, son?"
"Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag."
"No, it does NOT  sound nice!  Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band."
"If all your friends jumped off a cliff,  would you do that too?"
"You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL!"
Where is Stan?
What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
"And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?!"
"Stanley, what the hell are you doing?"
You get in the truck right now!
Get in the truck!
"Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed."
"Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?"
"Well, maybe it's time."
Because I said so!
"Let 'em be pissed off, then!"
No!!  NOOO!!
...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience.
Uh sure.
"Ohh, thanks."
What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
"Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--"
"No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it."
And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
See ya.
...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
See ya.
...And I left my family.
See ya.
"And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know."
"It's obvious to me, girl"
"The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world."
"Now, give it to me, 'cause..."
"I had everything. A huge house,  and all the women you can imagine.  And then one day, just as quick as it started..."
"Hey, Mr. Allens."
Who are they?
"But, w-we're still selling records, right?"
I'm 19.
"They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car..."
...the women all left...
...and they took back my house.
Ugh..!
"The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned."
"And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about."
"I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, ""No!"" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall."
Huh? Yeah?
"Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes."
"You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?"
"Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall."
Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
"Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie."
"Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon."
"Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death."
"Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!"
"Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both."
"Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child."
That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
"Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?"
Yeah.
"Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show."
"Shipped. He said ""shipped""."
"Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore."
Really? So we can't say ***?
"...Hey, you didn't get beeped."
"I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all."
That makes sense.
"Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts."
Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
"Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine."
You're the new scout leader?
He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
So he's a homosexual. So what?
"Aw, that's ridiculous."
"Come on, Stanley."
"Come on, Stan."
What did you say?!
"You do not say ""Big silly goose""! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!"
"Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!"
That's better.
Nice to meet you.
"Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then."
"Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape."
You bet.
"See ya, Mr. Grazier."
"Oh, no."
"Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off."
Oh my God.
"Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too."
WAAAH!
"Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!"
"No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual."
"Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!"
Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone!
What?
"Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit?  Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else?  Shu-Shu-Sharon?"
"Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?"
"Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days?"
Oh okay.
"I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one."
"Oh, man, it that the IT?"
"Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works."
"Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle."
Well... so... they don't really... do anything.
"So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?"
"Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?"
Yeah. You'd become what you hate.
"They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon."
Here he comes!
Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever!
"Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!"
"Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void."
They let you stay for free?
Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
"Oh, do we have to do it right now?"
"Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal."
So then it's not really ours.
"Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?"
Wait...
"All right, look, we've been here for over three hours"
"No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay."
"Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are."
"Well, this certainly is nice."
"Oh, God-damnit!"
"No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody!"
"Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!"
Let's just get out of here.
"All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!"
"Oh, Jesus."
"Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!"
"Stanley, they belong to him."
"Stan, you're behaving like a kid!"
Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.
"We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!"
What is that?
What?
Jesus Christ!
Vaginitis?
A Catholic boat trip?
Waaah! Waaah!  Uyah  ahem. 'Scuse me.
"Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests."
"With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests."
It couldn't hurt.
"You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!"
"Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists."
Yeah!
"Stan, you're an atheist now!"
"Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food."
"Noho, it doesn't work that way, son."
No it doesn't.
"Honey! Honey, come quick!"
"Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say."
"That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids."
"Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!"
"He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up."
"Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology."
"No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to."
Why? What's the matter with him?
Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
"Hey there, son."
"Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan."
"Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these ""ahta"" will start becoming a major part of your life."
"But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever."
"I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most."
"If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all."
"Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!"
"Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in."
Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.
"Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker."
"If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters."
"There, I think that's got it."
You can barely even tell you have one on.
There is no other team.
"Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us."
"Yeah, and you kicked ass!"
"Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years."
"The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you."
We can't tell you because we can't know where you are!
"Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you."
What's the matter?
"Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now."
"Sweetheart, you saw the news..."
"Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves."
What's going on?
What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!
"Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro."
Bi kute.
Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!
"That's it! Remember, son! Rememmmber!"
"No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together."
"Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home. Hoomme."
"Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor."
"A ladder to heaven? Why, son?"
That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard.
"The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven."
"No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny."
"Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven."
"No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough."
"Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but..."
"When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes."
"The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is."
What?
"Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven."
"If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons."
"Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??"
"No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it."
"Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?"
"Yeah, whatever."
"Hmmm, that gets rid of them."
"Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno."
You wanna go watch?
"You ready for some hot, steamy fun?"
"The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, ""this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made."""
I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that?
"Yeeaahhh.  Alright, you ready?"
"Oh, yeah."
"Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story."
Oh yeah.
"Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!"
The boys have the hottest porno ever made.
"Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet."
Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape?
"Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast?"
"Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded."
"Okay, problem solved."
"Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?"
"We...  Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box."
The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.
And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.
I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9.
"It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?"
"We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape."
"Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse.  Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love."
Jimmy! Jimmy!  Where did the boys go with the porno tape?
The video sandwich?
"What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?"
I know where it is!
Boys! Boys!
There you are!
"A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called ""69ing"" and it's normal."
That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
"Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it."
"Well, let's all get going."
"Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage."
"Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were."
"No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!"
"Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist."
"Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical ""sleepy Mexican."""
Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.
That's our Cartman.
"Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?"
"Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!"
Oh my God.
"He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting."
"We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?"
"Who is it, Sharon?"
Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
"Okay, we've had enough!"
I don't know.
How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
"Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you."
I think he's pretty scared alright.
"Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us."
"Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself."
Oh. You. You don't?
"Well, you know what I think, Stan?"
I think he IS from the future.
"Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol."
"Oh, Stan!"
"Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?"
"Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?"
"Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands."
Stan...
Uh... nothing. Go ahead.
AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!
"Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too."
"Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too."
"Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are."
"Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything."
"Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!"
"You really did a nice job, Eric."
Christmas is ruined again!
Stan!
"Oh, what a fighter."
The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
"How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!"
"He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool."
"Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square."
"Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!"
"Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!"
"Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song."
The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.
Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!
Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!
And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.
"No, but war shouldn't be our goal."
"If it means war, then we say NO!"
"I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!"
Why are we fightin' this war?'There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.'They didn't give me a choice.'War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!
"For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children."
He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.
And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!
"And me, I'll be the caring soul."
"Come on up here, everybody!"
"Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes."
"Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect."
"All right, time to win some money!"
"Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em."
"How's it goin', Gerald?"
"Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks."
"Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??"
"Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!"
Where did you get that kind of money??
Just six quarters!
He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.
They don't care.
But how can they do that?!
"No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves!"
"How much do we have to raise, Mayor?"
"Ohhh, never mind."
How can you do this to people?
There's more to life than profits!
"Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff."
"Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow."
Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.
"All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here."
"It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone!"
"We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  On thirty one black!"
Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!
Dammit!
Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.
Stan? Okay?
All right? Stan? Okay?
"Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?!  Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native Americans."
"Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes."
"It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over."
We can stand here as long as it takes.
What do they want?
You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
"Well, thanks."
How's your... mother?
It's cool on my tongue.
"Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live."
"Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left."
"You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people."
"The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO!"
Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
"Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone!"
We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.
We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.
Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!!
"Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual."
It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?
Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll.
You're looking ultra-fabulous.
"Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that."
"Well, we don't ""pound butt,"" Mr. Garrison, we're straight."
Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men!
"Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?"
"What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about."
Oh really?!
"Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare."
"Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!"
"Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!"
"Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!"
"Oh my God, it's on fire!"
I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
Put it out! Put it out! Fire!
Hey eses.
"Stan, are you okay?"
"Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths."
Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
"Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue."
"Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away."
Yes Dad.
Yes I know.
"Sharon, have you seen Dad?"
"Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out..."
At the same time.  Oh My God!
Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets!
Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?!
"The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!"
Oh My God!!
GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS!
GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!
GET OFF... GET STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET!
GAAAAAH!!
Come on!
Get over there! Stay low!
"Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find-  AWWWW!!"
RUN!
Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!!
In here!
Quiet! Keep quiet!
"Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to."
"Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go."
"Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!"
"You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!"
"We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?"
"Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!"
What the hell is going on?!
"Dad, what are you doing??"
"This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!"
Stan! Boys! You're safe!
"They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!"
"Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!"
"No, son. We... like to sleep in."
"They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!"
"Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?"
"Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does."
Huh?
"Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home."
That's our Grandpa.
Who?
Who are the Harrisons?
"Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!"
"We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger."
"All right, that does it!"
"I'm gonna go have a talk with this ""Mr. Harrison.""  If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong!"
"Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?"
"Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass!"
"God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass!"
"Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?"
"Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-"
"Uh, look, I just want to tell you that"
"Well, thanks. Uh..."
"Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son."
"You know. About... God, and stuff."
"Well, I-"
"Well, no, no, I just-"
Y-you can call me... Randy.
"Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?"
"Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night."
"Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?"
"Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion."
"All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!"
"One two three four. ""Pay one thousand dollars property tax.""  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening."
We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!
"And?  Your turn, Sharon."
Yes.
"Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons!"
"Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion."
"Ooo, what's that?"
"Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion."
Yeah!
"Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the ""no"" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it!"
What about emphysema?? Is that cool??
Pfft! That's none's the cool.
"Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-"
I don't have a son!
"Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!"
What?
"Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies."
Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
"Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!"
What happened to him?
What's the matter with him?
You got served? By who?
So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?
"No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak."
"Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!"
Now!
"All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight."
What?
So what happened?
"Uh, hey, ex- excuse me."
"Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father."
"Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on."
"No, no, no, it's not on."
It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.
I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye.
"Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah."
"His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh."
Stan? Stan?
"Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me."
"But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell."
"You did it, son! You did it!"
"Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon."
I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
....Yeeeah.
"Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?"
"Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!"
"Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!"
"Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting."
"We know, Stanley. We've been watching."
"That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour."
"Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!"
They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
"Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!"
"All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking."
Stan Marsh!
"Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done!"
"Hey, Mr. Nelson."
Why? This is my office.
What?
You can't be serious.
Oh my God. They took my jarb!!
"We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!"
"All we can do is try, Harrison."
Well what are we waiting for?
We're going back to the pile.
Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
"You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!"
You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
"You don't understand the issues, Sharon!"
You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
"Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!"
"Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!"
Expulsion?!
"Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?!"
"This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse."
"Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do."
"So who won, Mr. Mackey?"
Stan!
He's going to vote!
"Hey! That's not true, Stan."
Your vote still mattered.
Now your vote didn't matter.
"Look at it, honey. It's so big."
It's beautiful!
"Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters."
"It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it."
Aaaah!  Yeaaah... &lt;-&gt;
Anu-nothing!  I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.
"Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  I can all the bargains to myself!"
Staaaan?
Staan...
"No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night."
Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  Here. It's a little turtle.
"We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park."
"Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled."
"Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart."
"I know, I know! God!  Bleeeh!"
"Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!"
"Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!"
Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
"Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!"
"Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!"
I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
"Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips... And butter.  And some new pliers."
Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!
"Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya."
Can I help you?
You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.
"I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend."
"Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine."
Shhhhh! What are you talking about?
"Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God!"
Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!
Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains!
The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight!
"I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!"
This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers!
"Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!"
Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
"You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?"
"All right, let's not make that mistake again."
"Oh, no she di'int."
Believe what?
What are you talking about?
"Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?"
"Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!"
"Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there."
S-stan. STAAAN!
"Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please!"
My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!
Sta-ogh. Ugh!
"Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?"
Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.
"We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake."
It's yours.
My God...
I'm the... only scientist in town.
"You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!"
Check.
Vehicle shell holding!
The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies.
Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
Which cord is it?
I'm a geologist!
Nyugh!
It's working!
"It's, it's working!"
Stan!
Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.
"Good call, ref! Good call!"
What'd you say?!
You want me to kick your ass right here?!
"Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do?"
I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?
"This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America!"
Heeey!
Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
Wha-what do you mean?
I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
"Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!"
"Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem."
Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter batteruuuuuuuupp batterbatterbatterbatter!
Yeah!
"Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!"
Walk to first! Woo!
Fort Collins can't play!
"Come on, let's go! I'm right here!"
"Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry!"
Greeley sucks! Greeley sucks!
"What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America!"
"ЎPueblo, no bueno! ЎPueblo es muy mal!"
This is America! This is an honest America!
"Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever."
"I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game.  This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life."
"They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really ""trash-talk,"" but, I don't think Denver has a chance."
Well I think that there's a uh...
Oh my God.
...I'm not gonna go.
"Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go."
"I just... don't think I can, all right?"
"Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon."
"Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am."
"I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone."
"It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!"
"What do you wanna do, huh?"
Hey Bat Dad!  I didn't hear no bell.
What? I thought this was a free country!
"I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful."
"Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault."
"That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen."
"My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow."
"With all due respect, clichй dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow."
Oh my God... That's today!
Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!
"Come onnn, come on!"
"No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems."
"We, we didn't listen!  Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk!"
"Come on, hurry!"
"Go back, go back!!"
Get inside! We have to close these doors!
"Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming."
"Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!"
"You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate,  bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero!"
"All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can."
"Everyone below this line  will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line  is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out.  The balmy southwestern states  might have a chance but, New York  will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast.  What, Frank?!  Aw awww, Goddammit!"
Stan?? Stan!!
Stan??
"Stan, you're alive!"
"Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!"
"What is it, son?"
"You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!!"
I'm going to Beaverton.
My son is counting on me!
You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
"All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find."
Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!
"Yeah, me too.  Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing!"
Don't be a fag!  Come on! We can make it!  We have to try!
Stan?  We've found Stan! Ugh.
"Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights."
"Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!"
"Oh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley."
"Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?"
"Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!"
"Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?"
"Right now, Stan!"
Stan! What the hell did you do?!
"All right, what the hell is going on here?!"
"Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?"
"Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this."
"Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet."
"Come on, Mr. Cruise, this is ridiculous."
What did you say to him?
"Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out."
Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
"Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!"
Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer?
"Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?"
"All right, go ahead and tell him."
Aw rats.
"Hello?  Hey, come out of there!"
"Oh hey, sorry boys."
"Hey, see you Nelson."
"Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home."
"Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going."
"I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys?"
"...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan."
"Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  There's a  reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan.  When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp!"
Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Just hold the damn wheel!
"Oh yeah?  Get off my ass, dickhole!"
"Aww crap!  Here, hold this!"
"Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal."
"What seems to be the officer, problem?"
Okay.
"Okay, no problem. Easy."
"Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!"
Do what??
"Wull come on, that's impossible!"
"Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  Okay, hang, ha-, ...hang on... Hol-! Hold on.  Wa-hang on, hang on."
What? What did I do?!  What did I do?!
"Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these."
"Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess."
Hi Bill.
"Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer."
"But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic."
Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.
"What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing."
"Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again."
Uh... a disease?
Oh my God...
"Hello, Stan."
"No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick."
"Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease."
I can't! I'm sick!  It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?!  Stan! Stan!  Stan.
Stan I... need your help.
"Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?"
I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!
"I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle."
Cure... cure disease. STAN!!
"Uh, kay, here we go."
I gotta drive to Bailey.
"No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass."
They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!
Alright... then you drive.
"This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!"
"I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!"
"Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back."
Is this the line?  Oh God!  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?
I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism.
"Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him."
"I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?"
I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?
"We are the same, she and I."
This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!
"You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place."
The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go!
I'm going to die!
"Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it."
"Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through!  She's... beautiful.  Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah!  I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this!  It's a miracle! I'm cured!  Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God!"
"Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  It's just amazing. I haven't had a drink in five days. Praise Christ. Praise him."
"I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me."
"Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power."
Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?!
"'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may."
I'm Randy and I'm an alcoholic.
But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now!
"Oh wait. Sh sh. Hold on a second, gang."
What?
"That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease!  Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters!  Come ON! Let's GO!"
You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!
"I'm sorry, son! I'm off the wagon!"
But the statue wasn't a miracle!
"You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I can force myself to never drink again."
No??
"But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing."
How did I manage to raise such a smart kid?
Thanks son.
"Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two."
Come on!  Or maybe I'll have three beers.
Well how about four?
How about twenty?
Right right. Does vodka count?
