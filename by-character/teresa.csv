"And so then I met the school principal. What's her name? Principal Victoria? What a stupid bitch! I mean, excuse my language, but that bitch needs her fuckin' head examined!"
"Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me."
Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name?
Have you noticed how yellow that bitch's teeth are? You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage. She's garbage!  I went into the mall here and I just about dropped dead. The only panties you can buy makes you look like you have a grandma muff! Where's the Gucci? Where's the Prada? Have they heard of Italian clothes? It's ridiculous!
"Where can you get good clothes in this town?! Nowhere! I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right? And the woman that works the hair salon? Julia? Have you seen how big that bitch's ears are?"
"Ears out to here!  So I tell her, ""You got big ears, sweetie."" I'm not trying to be mean. It's just a Jersey thing. Why be offended? I mean, you've got a big chin. We've all got imperfections."
"That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No."
"You don't ever, ever! You whack job, prostitution...  ...whore! You probably sell your muff...  ...for six dollars! You fucking psycho bitch! Fuck you!  You're nothin' but garbage!  That's what you are! You're garbage!  You sick, old woman! Muff garbage!  Muff cabbage! Fuck this psycho bitch!"
"Let's get the fuck outta here! She's a fuckin' pig! She's fuckin' pissin' me off! Okay, I love you."
I love you.  I love you.
"I thought I was gonna deck her. I was fine. I was really fine. I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am.  Like I could be mad one minute and then I'll be fine."
"Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Me!"
Danielle was being a stupid bitch.
"I'm pathetic? You're muff gabbage!  Oh, Sharon!  Hi, sweetie. You gotta meet our new neighbors. This is Jacqueline. She's from Jersey."
That's Danielle. She's from Jersey.  And that's Caroline.
Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here!
"Get her, Sharon!"
"Don't you pull my friend's hair, you bitch!"
Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?!
Psycho bitch!
