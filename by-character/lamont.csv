I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire!  Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of bradying. From football quarterback to football singer.
"I know you all think what you're doing is new and hip and cool. But the truth is memeing has been around a long time. We're gonna watch a film strip now, that's a little dated but I think it gets the point across."
"Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe.  Faith Hilling, Taylor Swifting. These are things that will get you killed!  That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up."
Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point?
Good. Now put the gun in your mouth.
"Hey! You're following plankers and tebowers, so put a loaded gun in your mouth! DO IT!  Everybody take a good look.  This is what you're doing every time you play with Internet memes. You're playing roulette with your lives!"
I will be right back.
"Yes, what is this about?"
Another species? What are you talking about?
They're evolving. Cats are evolving.
"There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt."
Look. In the 70s there was fonzing.  Which replaced the outdated mustaching.  In the 60s cultural ideas were passed on by everybody poodle-fisting.  But even that evolved from people ass wedging in the 40s.  Even before photographs humans memed for portraits. All the way back to the Egyptians who had pictures painted of themselves donkey ticking.
"If they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures,  they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are."
What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you have any idea when you play with memes you're playing with fire?
"Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want?"
You cats want a war? Because that's what you're going to get!
