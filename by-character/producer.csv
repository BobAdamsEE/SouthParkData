I like it. That's these boys playing?
"That's pretty Goddamned impressive.  Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal."
"Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?"
"Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here."
"Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.  Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house."
Would you boys like to meet him?
"Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero."
You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
"You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks."
How are they coming?
"We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show."
"Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times."
"Remember, big, big, big!"
Jesus!
We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned Show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings!
"I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further."
"Remember, big, big, big!"
"Ooh, no, no, no, no!  This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever!"
"It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless..."
"Unless we can prove to the world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!"
"Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes."
"Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people!"
"No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!"
We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--
What is it?
He is?
You getting all this?
Get the Flight for Life helicopter!
"Oh, this is not good."
You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!
"Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan."
And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.
"Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown. That's your cue."
What is this? What's happening?!
Oooooohhhh!
Noooooo!
"Hmm… I really so no resemblance between that song and ""Stinky Britches"" by our artist, Alanis Morissette."
"I am above the law!  Mr. Chef, I’m afraid you leave me no alternative. We’re going to sue you."
Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business.
"And that chair, too. I want that chair."
"You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too."
"Take this, too."
I can take whatever I want.
I am above the law!  I told you not to mess with me.
You wouldn’t.
"That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!"
I am above the law!
What are you bastards doing?
"Oh, yeah? We’ll just see about this!"
We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts.
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win!"
No!
Noooooooo!
"Kid, can I talk to you?"
"Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town."
Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
"Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?"
"Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--"
I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning.
Take 112!
"Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right?"
"We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family.  Hey, what's that over there?"
"Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"
Exactly!
"Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen what it can do."
It's not?
"Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas."
"Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office?"
"Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.  You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?"
"Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?"
Let me show you what I mean.
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
"Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.  He really likes her voice.  You know, the way she vocalizes the melody,  it brings tears to his eyes."
"Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding."
He'll pay her four thousand dollars.
Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp. And don't be late.
"Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding. And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing!"
