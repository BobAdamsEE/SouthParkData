The Taliban has just released this videotape , in which it is clearly visible that they have indeed captured  Stevie Nicks. Miss Nicks appears to be in good spirits, though her whereabouts are unknown."
"With Stevie Nicks in captivity, the other members of Fleetwood Mac have been hidden so the Taliban can't get to them as well."

God-damnit!
