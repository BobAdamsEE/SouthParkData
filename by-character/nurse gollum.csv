Are you Kyle Broflovski?
I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?
"Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you."
So open them.
"Now, what seems to be the problem?"
"Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack."
What?
"Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head."
Colorado State.
"I-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really."
"No, I'm quite secure with it."
They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand.
"Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death."
"No, really, I don't need a--"
"I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person."
But I really don't think--
"You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job."
"Oh, no..!"
Nurse Gollum.
"Oh, boy."
"Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week."
"What I really wanna say is... well, -egh-- This may sound odd coming from a woman with a fetus sticking out of her head, but... you're all a bunch of freaks!"
"Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out?  I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long.  Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other.  And take those stupid things off your heads!"
I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down.
"He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now."
"But why, van Gelder?"
"He's been talking about ""the machine"" for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes."
A what?
"Well, what will you need?"
This is the strangest thing I've ever seen!
He owns the planetarium. What about him?
But why?
My God! This is amazing!
What's wrong with him?
