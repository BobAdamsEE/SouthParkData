How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.
"Nadia, my sweet Barshta"
"Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right."
Hah haha.
And me.
"How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!"
Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct.
My father died in a stamp-collecting accident.
We can't help it! You're bawlin' us to tears!
We demand you release these men at once!
"We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?"
"Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!"
Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
All these men wanted was to love a young boy!  There is nothing wrong with love!
"You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong.  Come on, men!"
"Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy."
Hu-uh?!
Nothin'. Just... shopping.
"Sure, I remember you!  You got it, baby... You got it, baby"
What's happening here?
"Hm... Well, let's just walk away then."

Maybe you're reading the map wrong.
"What the?  Oh no. No, no, no, no."
"I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles."
"Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles."
"...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car."
...It's... just you here?
"Oh, good."
"Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?"
How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?
Fine! Can you take us there?
Yes.
"Well, can you help us find the phone, please?"
"Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games."
What?
"Look, there's an elementary school  Come on, there might be some teachers inside."
"Linda, it's a remote-controlled car.  Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it."
See a movie?
"You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate?"

"Oh. Well, I guess we can always... just make another one."
"There, do you think that works?"
"They're right. We should have never crossed that picket line. Come on, honey."
"Oh, excuse me. I was just-  God-damned smartass! Do you think you could"
"Look, I apologize, but I was just--"
"Yeah, what has Catholicism come to anyway?"
"If there was a god, why would he let our kids be molested in the first place?"
"You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're worried we might have a hard time raising our son atheist. I mean-  whoa, thank you -I mean,  it could end up being very difficult raising an atheist child in such a Christian society.  I feel that everywhere my poor son goes he's being persecuted for his beliefs."
"Hat McCollough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released!"
To do what?
"Relax, Tweek. I am not here to hurt you. I am the Ghost of Human Kindness."
What does it mean?

"Wow, he's really great. We should get him to sing at Tommy's bar mitzvah"
He's alive!
Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital!
Oowhoops
"Ah I don't know, just ignore him."
"Stay back?! Hell, my wife and child are in there!"
"I don't know, but she is pissed."
"Sir, how can it be that a first timer scores that kind of thetan level?? He registered OT9! I'm only OT7 and I've been in the church all my life!"
