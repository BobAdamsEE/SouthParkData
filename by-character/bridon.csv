Special in their own way!
Let it out! Party people!
"East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free."
Hey.
Hi.
Hey.
Huh?
They are?
I don't blame 'em. All that singing and dancing? I can't stand it.
It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.
I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
I can't.
"It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me."
Really?
You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight.
"Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'."
"No, Dad, can we just talk?"
"Dad, I want to join the basketball team."
This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.
"But Dad, it's what I really want."
I know. That's kind of why I like it.
"It's my life, Dad!"
"Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom."
"Look, I should be getting to class."
I don't know...
Okay.
Thanks.
"Dad, I was just messin' around."
"Dad, stop!"
"Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me."
You're hurting my arm.
"Yeah, great."
"Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-"
No! I'm sick of singing!
Just let me go.
"I'm ready, coach."
I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.
"Uhh, sure."
