Hello everyone!
What seems to be the problem?
"All right, let's see here.  Oh my God!!"
"Why, there's a huge crack goin' right down the middle!"
"All right, let's take a look."
Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...
"Wait, what's this?"
"I've never quite seen this before, uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream."
I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way.
