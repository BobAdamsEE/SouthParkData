"Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl."
"Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?"
"Hm. No, we never had a any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves."
"Yeah, I don't, uh... Hold on a second. There was one we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial."
"We, uhhh, found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges."
"Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with doodie feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm!"
"Heh, yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure."
