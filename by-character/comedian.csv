"So I said to my wife, ""You told me to kill the damned cockroach! Don't yell at me for making a mess!""  We've got a great crowd here tonight. Now, how many people are actually from Colorado?  Ya got nothin' better to do on a Friday night than to go to a comedy club, huh?  Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?  Yeah. I know you. You're the guy that said ""nigger"" on Wheel of Fortune.  Look! Everybody! It's the ""nigger"" guy."
"Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave to the ""nigger"" guy.  Say, ""Hi, 'nigger' guy!"""
"That's all right, ""nigger"" guy. You know we're just playin'."
"Have you all seen these navigation systems in these cars these days? Damn things look like they're straight out of ""Far Out Space Nuts"". Maybe ""nigger"" guy has one. You got one, ""nigger"" guy?"
