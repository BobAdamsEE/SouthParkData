Is this Classroom 7?
My name's Cody. I'm your smartnician. You're havin' some intelliproblems with your astutelinks?
"Uh huh, well here's the problem: your amsrtnames aren't intelligrated. "
"If you wanna have those intelligrated with EasyLink, you might wanna upgrade your system to the silver package."
Let my call my supervisor on the intelliphone. 
"Okay, there we go.  Your students can buy school lunches now, but they won't be able to get grades."
"Well, what you prbably wanna do is upgrade to IntelliLink Platinum."
"...What exactly do you mean by ""work""?"
"Oh, you want the Centurion package. That's where we take all the IntelliLink panels and we rip them off the walls and we burn them. Then we wipe all the computers of IntelliLink software and you never deal with us again."
"Right away.  Well alright sir, here's a clipboard you can use for students to sign up for counseling,  and I wanna thank you for choosing IntelliLink. "
