Who is your best friend?
What's my last name?
We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!
So what's the p-plan?
"All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us."
Kenny's down. K-k-kenny is down.
Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
Hey fellas.  You should come downstairs. Stan's mom made pa-pizza.
Du... du... dude.
Ur ur re- ur really?
I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide
Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up!
"Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul."
"Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun."
"Hey Kyle. So, ...how was it?"
Sucking Cartman's b-balls.
Oh my sweet J-Jesus!
The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.
Yeah.  We've gotta geh- ...geh... get the hell ...outta here f- f-hast fast.
We can't help him now.
"And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen."
"I thought I could go on like before. But after seeing Indiana get raped... After seeing Indiana get raped I know I'll never be the sa-a-ame, the same? The same.  Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator?  It didn't make any sense, Stan."
"You can't run away from it forever,  Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow."
...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?
"Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this?"
Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
I'll bet she is!
"As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight."
Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
"Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ!"
I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.
"Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower."
Yeah. Where the hell have you guys ...been?
"Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan?"
"M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel. Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-"
All righty then.
"There you go. Feel better, p-pal?"
School again.
"Well, so, w-who is she?"
"Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me."
"Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out."
"Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic."
We're finally gonna learn the chocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.
"Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy  ...rou-routine."
"Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week."
"Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry."
Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
"...So the Pope says, ""What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?"""
"Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life."
"You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks."
Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks.  Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before?
"Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?"
You like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
"Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?"
"Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde."
P-patent?
"Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh."
"Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh..."
Actually it was potato chips.
"W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room."
Really?
"Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much."
"Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did."
"Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips."
"Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'."
"Wow, thanks Eric."
Is that... Is that how it happened?
I'm... I'm sorry?
Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.
That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.
"Hey, you're really onto something there."
"Right. And then I say, ""Yeah."""
"Oh wow, this is incredible!"
It was just a-
"Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-"
Yes Ma'am.
It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
"Eric, there's something I really need to know."
How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke.  But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!
How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
"Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are."
"Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-"
"Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-"
"Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!"
"I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough."
"Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat."
What was that?
"Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!"
What?!
"Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?"
"What? I, I still don't get anything."
"Rih, r-r-really?"
"Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding."
"Go ahead, Bu-Butters. Go- go get some."
You're a man now! All right Butters good job!
Sounds good.
So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
I am gonna k-kick your ass!
Your girlfriend is a whore!
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back"
"What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?"
"Oowow, it's really him."
"Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!"
"Lies! These are all a bunch of lies!  Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!"
Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!
"You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!"
"I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots."
"Wha-what are you talking about, Eric?"
"To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tututwenty five seconds ago."
What what's that?
"You've gotta swim over here, Kyle."
"Okay, w-where's the maintenance room?"
"Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle."
"Oh boy, Timmy, it's our favorite time of year."
"We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Frances. Hey Frances!"
"Alright blue team. As team captain, I need to make sure we are ready for the big camp competition."
All right! Everyone together! Are we gonna beat Red Team this year?
"You too, Ne-n-Nathan."
Gonna catch a wave...
"Oh boy, here it comes! Here it comes!"
"It's a snap at Tardicaca Camp to learn to do the hula hula danceI fell in love with a Tardicaca dove while doin' that funny funny dance.And that poor little kid, why she never did know what love had in store.So I made up my mind-"
So I made up my mind that I've just got to find the Tardicaca girl I did adore.
Hurr a little Tardicaca...
She's a candy cane to wiggle
She's sure to make you g-giggle.
With her naughty little wiggle. I know someday
"I'm gonna try to make that Tardicaca gally mine, gally mine.'Cause all the while I'm dreaming of her. My Tardicaca Hola Gal!
Oh sorry, that's not right. Hang on. '"
"Out on the beach with my cute little peach where the waves are rolling in so highHolding her hand, our feet on the sand-"
"If you get in a pinch, go through, it's a cinch-"
"Sorry Mims, I I just can't remember it."
"Alright Mimsy, m-maybe you can show me how it's done."
"Nathan, your team put up an amazing fight. And even though I was crowned the King of Cripple Camp, I want you to know that you were the real ch-cha, champ."
Of course.
"Here you go.  Here you  go. Don't forget to...  vote, everyone.  Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow."
"Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show."
Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?
"Don't worry, everybody. I've spared no expense to make my comedy awards the biggest thing this school has ever seen. You're all gonna have a blast."
Welcome... to the special ed department's... first annual comedy awards.
"Please welcome your host, Jimmy Valmer."
"Woohoo! Alright!  Oh boy, what a terrific audience. Can I get a wuhwuhwuh what? What?  We're here today to honor those who t-t-tirelessly work so hard to make us laugh. The first comedy award we are presenting is for the funniest kid in school. And the nominees are:"
"Oh wow, this is so exciting, isn't it?  And the winner is...  Oh my God! Jimmy Valmer! I can't believe I w- won!"
"Wow, this is the greatest day of my life. Thanks everyone, for this incredible award."
Go? We still have over fifty awards to hand out.
"...and the winner for best comedy performance in a movie is...  Ben Stiller! Come on up here, Ben.  Is Ben Stiller here?  No? Huh... I guess B-ben Stiller could not be with us, so I'll accept this award on his behalf.  And the award for funniest correspondents dinner speech goes to...  President Obama!  Is President Obama here? No? Ah I guess we'll just accept this award on his behalf."
"Wow, what a terrific audience. Isn't this great.  Can I get another wuhwuh wha wha what what?  And now it's time to give out the award for the least funny people in the world. And the nominees are:"
"And the winner is... the Germans!  Uhhh... I guess unfortunately the Germans could not be with us tonight. So I will accept this award on their behalf.  Auf Wiedersehen.  And now, for the Kathy Griffin Award. The Kathy Griffin Award will be given each year to the person who is most likely to actually show up to receive the Kathy Griffin Award. And the winner is...  Tyler Perry."
"Okay, thahks, Tyler Perry."
"I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry."
"I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!"
"Dad, I'm really feeling sad and let down right now, and I feel like I can't even get a response from you. Could I at the very least please just get a what what-what?"
"Thanks, Dad."
The national news? Oh my gosh! People do care!
"Duh-n, don't worry fellas. Everything's gonna be okay."
"Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success."
"No don't worry, everybody. I'm sure that Germany can take a joke just like the rest of us."
What- what am I supposed to s-say?
"What's the matter is this Funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy. I don't think things are better, I think they're worse."
"Now look, I know that I've put every comedian in the world out of work, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual Comedy Awards was a success."
"Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed."
"Excuse me, Funnybot. My name is Jimmy, and I'm a stand-up comic. You're putting a lot of good people out of work."
Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean?
Wuh w-what?!
"Funnybot, this is not a good joke. There won't be anyone around to laugh."
But don't you see? This is why comedy is for humans. You need to leave the jokes to people like me and Adam Sandler.
"Oh my God! That's it! Fellas, get me a Ken doll and some Scotch tape.  Funnybot, I've been talking it over with the fellas and actually, we think what you're doing is genius."
"Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award."
It's a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.
"Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!"
"Eh, b-base."
"Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit."
All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy.
"Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary."
"Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate."
"...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?"
All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
"Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%."
"But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%."
A...a...a...a sue-ance?
"Wow, that's weird."
"Jeez, it's not working."
What's happening now?
Yeh. Let's go bi- pick on him! Yeh!
Ah I don't see a b- b- Bat-Mobile.
"Wop. Wop, Wop wop, Wopwop Gangnam Style."
This is an outrage! Who out there is saying that our friend Stan is a liar?
"Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff."
"He said ""at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red"""
Ruh Rehh... Red
"Heheh, I get it. General Tso's chih-chih-chicken."
"Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos"
"There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue."
There he is. Hey Kyle!  The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.
"Uh, I'm just gettin' ready for cla-"
M ma um m-me too.
"Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox."
Yeah!
"You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on."
"Ya yo you can't, you can't do that."
"Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us. "
"C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club."
"Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton."
"Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up."
It's the enemy! Defensive po-po-p-po-p-positions! 
That's right. Red Robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall.
Yeah that's that's that's pretty nice. 
"Hey Stan, did you see Clyde's going out with Lisa B-b-Berger?"
Yeah. I wouldn't mind t-tah-t-tappin' that ass.
"Well, y-you gotta admit, Lisa Berger is pretty hot, Wendy."
Wow! Wow! She looks great!
I thought you guys said you didn't need school.
"Yeah well, no one's laughing, Kyle."
No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped!
"Yeah, she isn't as hot in person."
"Hey, Craig. Have you checked out the Internet lately? "
Ohhhh nothin'. It's just that... y-you might wanna invest in some hedge clippers. 
Ohhhh nothin'. You just might wanna... hire Tarzan to do some... landscaping work for your mom. 
"Oh! Hey Kyle!  Kyle, hang on a sec. "
"Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun."
"Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?"
"You betcha, pal. "
"Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here.  Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?"
The Terrance & Phillip mobile game.  All the cool kids are usin' it.
"Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff.  It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? "
"Why sure fellas.  Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid."
Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
"I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all."
Alright alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff.
They pay me to!
Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman.  People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.
"I needed the money, alright?!  I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!"
"It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much."
Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing.
"Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?"
"This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic."
"I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help."
"What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say ""I have a problem."" And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. "
"Fantastic girls volleyball joke, Stan."
"Here, watch."
See?
Well hello everyone.
"Wow, what a great audience.  Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B.  You guys like im- personations?"
"How about Jimmy Stewart? ""Merry Christmas, movie house."" And John Travolta. ""Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!"""
"Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas."
"See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas."
"Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired!  What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, ""Are you angry at God for making disabled people?"" I say, ""No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush."""
"Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park.  H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? ""Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!"""
"And how about that school counselor? ""Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad.""  ""Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?""  Wow, what a great audience. ""Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-""  ""Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat""  ""I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch.""  ""Salisbury steak for lunch."" Eh. Uh. ""Goddamnit, Goddamnit!""  And of course, my very favorite, ""Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!""  ""Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy."" Heh. Sometimes it's like, ""Please, Timmy, learn a new word,"" heh. ""Timmy! Tu-Timmy!"""
"Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake."
"Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet."
What's that?
A present? You got me a p-present?
"... Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent.  If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh?  Wow, a parka.  You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim."
"Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits.  This is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim. Well, I'll see you around."
"Thanks again, Tim-Tim."
"And so I said to him, ""Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf.""  Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy?"
"Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too.  Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat.  Just for a second, Timmy.  Don't be a jerk, Timmy.  Hey, don't push me!"
"Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much."
"Wow, what a great audience. For my first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer. Come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it!"
"Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!"
Put on the hat!
Pu-put it on!!
Not this year.
Come on. Come on!
Come on!
Uh.
Huah!
Come on!
No!  Ow!
Timmy? Timmy? I told you to put on the HAT!!  You dirty motherfucker!
"Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts."
I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts.
Yes?
Out of Scouts?
What?  Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!
No! No!
"Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much."
What's this all about?
"Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much."
"Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine."
Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?
"Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...  eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken."
"Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock."
Orange.
Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?
"Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock."
An interrupting ca'ow.
Moooooo!  ...What a terrific audience.
"Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?"
"Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas."
"Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what?"
Oh boy! Oh thank God!
"Well, I don't think I did too well in the... bathing suit competition. But I can't wait for the talent show competition. That'll really my chance to... shine.  Wow, what a terrific audience. So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A guy walks into a b- ...buh...  A guy walks into a guy walks into a  babuh ba-a-a, uh-"
Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.
"There's some chocolates and lih-licorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside."
"Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later."
"Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please."
That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f-...forces.
"Well, where is the videotape rented from?"
"You guys, this is stupid."
"Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?"
They are coming.  You guys go on ahead.
Go!  You shall not...pah..? You shall not..puh...  You shall not paah...  You shall not pa--!  You shall not paah--!  You shall not puh-uh-uh--  You shall not pass.

"In her... va-vagina.  Thank you, thank you. What a terrific audience."
"Wow, what a terrific audience. Thank you for giving me this great honor, Mayor. B-before I l, l.. light the tree, I was wondering if I could sing... my favorite ...Christmas song, real quick."

"Butters, w-where is everybody?"
Christopher Reeve? Christopher Reeve?!
I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?!
"So then, how come you came?"
"Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show!"
"I know that, I was being f-f-f-fa...cetious!"
"Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do!"
I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH!
"Can you believe this asswipe, Timmy?"
"Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much."
Hey there fellas.
"Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled."
"To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!"
"Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join."
Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? One.  You know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name is.
"Hello, Mr. McGillicuuhuhuhh... Mr. McGillicuddy."
Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club.  We just came up with a name this morning.
Why not?
...There's already a Crips?!
"No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?"
"Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it."
Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.
"Excuse me, sir.  we're looking for a group of people called the Crips."
Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.
"Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim."
"Well hello everyone.  I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy."
"Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc Denver chapter."
"We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident?"
"I agree. I mean, it's like  ""come on""! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?"
"Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group?"
"Well, sure. Tim and I would love to pop some punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific at it."
"I don't know, Timmy, just play along."
"Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww... Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown."
"Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?"
"That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park."
"Well hello, officers."
We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods.
"Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store.  That must be what the fellas meant by ""pop some punk-ass Bloods."" They want us to get them some soda pop and treats.  Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure."
"Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver!"
So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?
"Wow, these guys really are crippled.  Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant."
"Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time."
"You dawgs keep it real, too."
"Well, that sure was a terrific time. Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy."
"Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops?"
No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool.
"Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung ...Pao Chicken, please."
"What's that? Oh, and one medium lemonade, please."
Hunh?
Ah- are you sure?
"Well gee, that's really nice of you, Mr. ...Chinese person.  Look Tim-Tim, we got a cash prize. We must be the ...one hundredth customer or something."
"Actually, it was a regular lemonade."
"Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time."
"Yo, Mamsie. What's up, Pops?"
"A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg."
"Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean  come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much."
"Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends."
Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!
Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.
"Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the nigga on your left."
Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six-
Jesus Christ!  Holy G...guacamole!  Freakin' Frijoles!  Leapin' L-langosta.
"Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer?"
The... B-Bloods?
The-they do??
But... but why do they hate each other?
"Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?"
"Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong."
"Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to sstop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk."
"You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there."
This is gonna be t-terrific!
"Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.  Great to see you all. What a terrific audience."
"We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by."
You bet.
"Oh, we will."
"It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles."
"But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along.  Theeerrre's pizzaaa."
"Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers."
Look: we hve the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?
"Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean,  Come on!"
"I said, ""I mean,  Come on!"""
Come on.
Come on.
"I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger."
I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?
"Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem?"
"Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice."
"Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote."
"Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock."
"Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Now you say, ""Ingmar Bergman who?"""
Hey Stan.
For- Forw- Forw-w-w what?
She's what?
"...Okay.  Hey uh-Wen, hey wu-Wendy."
Stan says you're a cont... you're a- cont- S-Stan says you're a cont- cont-
"She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over."
Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
"Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven."
"Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now?"
"From the n-n- from the nn-, from the nn-"
"Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?"
Bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- Butters!
Hey fellas.
"Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver."
Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.
"Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year."
S-s-six!
S-s-s-ssseven!
S-s-seven!
"Ni- I can- I can't!  Huff. Oh man.  Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year.  All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven ru-reps. Hoh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room."
"You too, Francis."
"Oh he-hey, N-Nathan."
"Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training really hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away."
What kind of shortcuts?
S-s-ss-s-s-steroids?  ...But aren't those illegal?
"So uh, ha-how do they... w-w-work?"
How much would this cost me?
"Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a per-formance en... hancer."
Oh! Agh! Ju-just a second!
"Hang on, I'm-I'm, coming."
I said I'm coming! Give me a Goddamned s-second!  Hold it.
"N-no, Dad."
"Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy."
Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.
"Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week."
"Dad, Jesus C-Christ!"
"You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving."
"I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?"
"Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later?  I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim."
"Look it's really none of your b-b-b-beeswax, Timmy!"
"Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them!"
"You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you?"
"Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it!"
Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.
"S-s-s-so what are you gonna do now, huh?! You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show that b-bottle to the... coaches?!  Don't think you're any better than me, Timmy! I'm just living in the real world!  Fuck!"
Y-yeess! Grrrr!
"Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard."
"Yeah, b-bigger, stronger!"
"Come on, push it! Push it!  Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps."
"The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time."
Oh Jesus!  You gonna start running your mouth off again?  P-push it! Push it!
Theh-they're all just... jealous.
"You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!"
"I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why did you make me do it, huh?!  You're not leavin' anybody! You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told!  '"
"Stay away from me, you stupid b-b-b-bitches!  No! God!  '"
"Top athlete, yeah! '"
Yeeessss!  Yes! Yes!
"Yeah! Yeah!  Yeah, I did it!  Yeah! Yeah! '"
"Yeah! Fuck yeah!  Yeah, I did it! I'm the b-bub-best!  '"
"Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?! '"
"You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?!  I should k- ick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!"
What?
"Oh my God. You-you're right, Timmy. You're totally right.  Everyone, can I have your attention, please?  I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting.  A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him.  Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics.  Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a  big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say,  ""Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy- ""  ""-steroid-taking jackass.""  That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year. To compete with honor.  '"
"That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea."
"Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?"
"Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds.  Okay now, t-tell me the first one again?"
And the second?
"Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Better give it another ten seconds. All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one?"
"Okay, I think, that's it. Number 2?"
"Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire."
"Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g- Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today?"
Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.
The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County.
More snow for South P... P-P-Park. Here's Token Black with the weather.
And that's all for Super School News. Enjoy your day at South Park Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh- &gt; Ehehehehe  Eh-Elementary. -&gt;
"For God's sake,why Mr. M-M-Meryl?!"
"But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring the news to the students. They need to know the facts, and our news team delivers them, very much."
"Fellas, are you sure all of this ie-eh-ethical?"
The Park County School Board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-
"This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty."
"Fellas! Fellas, I got fant-tastic news! The vice-President, Dick Cheney, was in Denver yesterday, and I got an interview with him for our news show."
But this is real news!
How do you know?! You you haven't s-seen it yet!
"Well, in the interview, Mr. Cheney tells me all about how the-"
"Look, fellas, I've got a real problem with the direction our news show is going! We're dumbing down the school!"
"This isn't the news! This a b-b-bastardized quest for ratings! Damnit, we have a journalistic responsibility to bring students the fa... the facts!  Don't you see what we've done? In our efforts to compete with Craig's small-minded show, we've made a mockery of n-nununews reporting. I remember when we all made an oath to each other, way back when started playing news reporter, that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity! Well our integrity is jeopardized! And if we can't report news the honest way, what good is n-news reporting?"
"Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my point. We have to elevate our ideas up, not down."
"Wow, coming up with ideas is... hard."
B-b-bingo!
"Wha-what do you think, fellas?"
I think maybe he's f-feeling it.
"Fellas, this is our chance! Everyone get your hair looking as fantastic as possible. It's time for us to do the most incredible investigative news report of our journalistic lives!"
"P- Principal Victoria, can you explain how your administration fuh-failed to see this p-p-pro-o-o... p-p-problem."
I wonder... oo-oo.. w-why?
"Yep, b-b-b-bail."
"Yeah. Let's face it, we're winners."
"Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman?"
"Yeah. S-see ya, Eric."
"Uh no, that-that's okay, Mr. Mackey."
"Uhhh, just uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey."
Uh...
Hey fellas.
Oh I sure have. I've been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long
"Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone.  Aaah!"
"I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas.  Eh, excuse me! Evuh evuh - excuh, cuh, cuse me! Excuse me, puh-please."
"Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?"
"Fine, Mom."
What? Uh who told you that?
Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus!
Dz-n-Doctor Pal?
"Uh, sure?"
"Well, a little, yes."
But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday.
Ke...c-come again?
"N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss"
"Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She's very excited to get started on her new show, ""Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet.""  So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. Have you seen this, have you heard about this?  A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope, a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic.  Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson is having back problem in court.  You know... huh... you uh you know what they say about b-b-b-b-back problems.  Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience.  What a fantastic audience."
Nuh uh! Wuh. Huh. Waaagh! Ungh!
Butters!
"Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me."
"Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard?"
Really??
"So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?"
But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday.
Hey Bertha.
"Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina?"
But the talent show is tomorrow!  Ooo!
I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?
"Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before?"
"Well, wha-what do I do?"
"Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch."
"Wow! Thanks, Eric."
Hey Shawna.
"Wow, Shawna, you look f-fantastic."
"We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini"
"Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers."
"Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."
"Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."
"""If you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend."" Wow, how insightful."
Really?
"Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shawna, because I really wanna stick my penis in your vagina."
But the talent show is tomorrow night!
"Oh... Hi, Officer B b-b-buh b-b-buh b-Barbrady."
I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show.
I just c-can't risk getting up in front of everyone.
All right! I I keep getting an erection for no reason! Okay! But I can't get any of the girls here to let me... do it to them.
Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don't wanna have it in their vaginas? It's like a cruel joke.
...Colfax Point?
"Really? M-maybe I can catch the bus ...and get down there before the talent show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady!"
"Hello? Hello? I need to put my ...p-penis in a woman's vagina. Any takers?  Excuse me, ma'am. What's your name?"
"Well, Nut Gobbler, I need to get laid."
"I have a raging hard-on that just won't quit, and the talent show has already started."
"No. Actually, I'm a stand-up comic."
Sure do.
Sure. I know the p-perfect place.
"Hey, can it, jackass! I just don't want them to know I was here with a different girl."
This is authentic Italian food straight from S-Sicily. You should try the Lotsa Mozzarella Pizza Roll.
"Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."
"Wow. You know, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. If you're pissing blood, you can shove a tampon up your peehole. You are very insightful. Please tell me more."
Well of couse I wanna get laid. That's why I'm taking you to this ...fancy place and pretending to be interested in what you have to say..
What? Fo-for real?
"Well jumpin' Jesus, what are we wasting our time here for then? The talent show is happening right now! Let's get to r-r-rammin'!"
"I beg to differ with you, sir. I paid for her and took her out to dinner. She's my ho!"
"Yes, I do have a problem, as a matter of fact! I've spent all my money on this ho, and she's now my only shot at getting laid, and the talent show is only a couple of hours from being over."
"Sir, sir, that is my ho!"
"Sir, sir!"
Son of a ...b-bitch!  Taxi!  Follow that pimp and ho!
"Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking her, you are no better than a common th-thief!"
"Nut Gobbler, grab onto my crutch!"
"I got you, Nut Gobbler!"
"Come on, ho!"
Eugh! Stay on him! I'm not giving up!
Get close to him!  How much do I owe you?
"C-can I just get two back, please?"
Thank you.
"Don't worry, Nut Gobbler! I'm coming!  Oh Jesus, not now.  Oh boy, this is embarrassing."
"Hey, j-j-jackass!  I'm sorry I resorted to calling you jackass just now, but I'm very upset!"
What do I have? The weapon of comedy. So apparently the Chinese and the Japanese aren't getting along lately. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't been getting along with my stomach for years.
Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
She's apparently gotten real good with baking cakes with keys in them.
"Nice teamwork, Nut Gobbler."
"Not really. You're just a hooker, and I need to get laid. The talent show could be over any minute."
"Hold everything!  Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind, I'll be taking that microphone.."
"Wow, what a terrific audience. So apparently it's been exactly two years since the fall of Baghdad. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Just as B-Bush predicted, Baghdad fell, Iraq fell, Saddam fell. The only thing that didn't fall was ...the price of gas.  I just read in the paper that China's protesting Japan. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah, I guess in China you don't get to-  You've gotta be kidding me."
"Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard!"
"Yeah, beat it, j... jackass."
The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars.
"Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fuck ourselves."
