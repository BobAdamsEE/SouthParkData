"Hello, little boy.  You like my flippers?"
I did.
"This is very exciting! Usually when I talk, nobody can hear me. Where are you from?"
It sure is nice to have somebody to talk to. Can't we talk more? Please?
Let's talk about rocket ships.
"Yeah. I love rockets, but I can't see them 'cause I'm stuck in this tank. . You know, someday, I wish that I could go up in space in a rocket ship."
"I try to be, but my wish is to one day blast off in a big rocket ship!"
"Oh God, it's funny every single time."
Please don't call me stupid.
"I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't talk. It's because I'm very very sick, you see."
"Yes, because I'm not used to the earth atmosphere. You see, my name is actually Willzy-x, and I'm from the moon!"
"The... that's where all orca whales are from. If I don't get back to the moon, I'm going to die."
I used to. I wish I could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again.
"I can't tell them, because they're evil communists from the Horsehead Nebula. They want to kill all us zypods, so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform."
"Uh, uh, sorry boys, I can't talk anymore. I'm too sick.  Can't. Talk. Any. More."
