"It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts."
"Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran."
"ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!"
But you ruined the whole show!
But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!
"Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car."
"No, it uses natural gas."
"Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit."
"But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic."
"Don't call me a rat, buddih!"
"He's not your buddih, friend!"
"Yeah, let's give it up, guy."
"Well I'm not your friend, buddih!"
"Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!"
"We're setting you adrift, idiot!"
"He's not your guy, friend!"
Queef Sisters?!
You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!
Because babies come from there!
"Brian, don't do this!"
Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.
"All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!"
Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!
Your idols?
"I don't think I can do it, Phillip."
Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.
AAH!
"No, that was me, Phillip. I farted."
Phillip?! I'm Terrance!
Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.
SICK!
What?! Gross!
After everything we've been through?
"What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes."
"Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong."
"Hello, and welcome to Progressive."
"Well, you've come to the right place."
"Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip."
"You're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob."
Hey Phillip! Pull my finger!  Aaaahahahaha. 
What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!
What's this?
So this is- Everyone is doing this?
"Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad."
Hey Phillip! 
"Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing."
We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.
You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!
"You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!"
But then all our profits come from people with problems.
Who IS this guy?!
Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!
Oh no!
That's stupid.
"Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig."
Watch me plebeian.
Hey dumbasses.  You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?
Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.
Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way.
"By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being.  Good luck with your stupid little pig."
"Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone."
"Dad, you're the best."
But he's our science fair project!
But dad!  I want a human clone.
"They're all stupid anyway.  Come on guys, let's go."
"Hey, they've got our clone.  He belongs to us."
Daddy! Nooooo!
"You cheating bastards.  This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow."
"Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man.  I present to you, the five-assed monkey."
"Wait, before you do, pull my thumb."
"Ohhh, you farted."
"Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?"
"Alrighty then, here's a two-lip."
You're an asshole Phillip.
"Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart."
Oh no.
"Hey Phillip, guess what?"
Fart.
"Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans."
"Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart."
"Haha, that I am!"
"Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?"
Ohho God.
"Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?"
"Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!"
Hey Phillip.
Is there a penny stuck in my butt?
It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here.
"I sure am cold, Phillip."
"Gosh, I hope we don't starve."
"Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?"
"Huh, eh,  wait wait wait.  Eh, eh.  Here it comes, ehhhh.  Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!"
I spattered his face!
"Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter."
"Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense."
"Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?"
That's called a monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys!
"Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument!"
"Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber."
"That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kraft Dinner."
Head cancer??
"Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip."
"But we're not gay, Phillip."
"Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kraft Dinner!"
"Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week."
God only knows.
It sure is. Let's look for treasure.
"Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip."
"My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob."
"Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob."
No it isn't.  Wanna see what's on the inside of me?
"Yes.  If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are."
"Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you."
"You know I never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip.  I'm going to put on a pirate costume."
"Shiver me timbers, Phillip! At this rate I'll never get to my Kraft Dinner!  Oh my God!"
No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.
My daughter.
"Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?"
Oh. Well. It all began fif-teen years ago.
"Yes, indeed.  But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran.  And I will have to go and find her."
"You're such a good friend, Phillip."
"Avast there, mateys!"
"Hello, Celine Dion."
You're looking well.
"Celine, where is our daughter, Sally?"
"Wrong! She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner."
"Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return."
"We just grew apart, Celine Dion."
How's the paper bag working out?
"Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please."
"In-deed, Phillip."
"Same here, Phillip!"
I Got Ya.
"Ow, that's rancid! hahahahaha."
"Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin."
"Oh, good."
"I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance.  I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors."
"Well, enough of Iran, let's get home."
"Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again."
"No, you're gaining a pop vocalist."
It seems to have changed.
"What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?"
I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.
"Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--"
Why?!
"You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?!"
What the hell are you doing here?!
"Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!"
"Look at him, Celine Dion!"
What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!!
"Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada."
"Oh, hello, Scott."
"Hey, Scott. Guess what?"
"Ooh, stop that!"
Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.
It's so stupid!
They look like groundhogs.
"Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?"
"Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kraft Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks!"
"It sure did, Phillip.  Oh, wait. That is the phone.  Hello?"
"Oh.  Hey, it's Scott."
"Phillip says hello, Scott."
"You are such a dick, Scott."
You're a dick.
You're a dick.
You're a dick.
You're a dick.
"I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?"
"How do you like that, Scott?!"
"Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?"
"Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'"
"Oh, wait a second, Scott."
"Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up!"
Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure.
We're looking for treasure!
Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.
That plan's scary!
"For Canada, Phillip."
"Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada."
That's funny!
Why is that?
"Yes. Apparently, he does."
"Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea."
"Well, I guess it's time, old friend."
"Now, Phlllip?"
"We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!"
"Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea."
"Hey, Scott, you like apples?"
How do you like them apples?
Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
"Sure thing, Phillip.  Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!"
"Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news."
"The good news is, you have a clean bill of health."
"The bad news is, you have cancer."
Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.
Yes. See this X-ray?  That's your ass. See this line?  That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.
"No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore."
We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
"I am, Phillip. I am."
"Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass."
"Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better."
"Hey, Phillip, pull my finger."
"Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder."
"Hurgh, urgh.  Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip!"
"Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!  Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-  Caught you there!"
"Yes, I sure did!"
(Fart)
Boo!
"Oh, Phillip, what a precious gift!"
Check out this one.
"Okay, here I come, okay."
"Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb."
Let me see.
I don't see anything.
"I still don't see anything, Phillip."
AAHahahahahahaaa!
"Why, did you fart?  Oh, no!"
"Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the , and that's how you  get to the auto garage!"
Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass.
OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.
You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.
Because I had an itch up my ass.
Terrance & Phillip will be right back...
"Hellooo, Den-ver!"
"How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh.  Hey, do you all remember this one? ""Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass."" ""Reallih? Let me take a look."" ""Look closer."""
"And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy!"
Hello Phillip.
"Say, Phillip, I have a question for you."
And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62.
He sure did.
Who.
Who!
Who passed gas!
That's the man's name?
Yes!
"Right, the guy that drank his own urine."
"Mmm. Mmm, yummy.  Mmm."
"We sure did, baby.  Next?"
You're a huge fan alright!
But what do I get in return?
"Oh yeah.  Oh, that's good, baby."
You like that?
Yeah.
Ah good.
Yeah-
"Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?"
Oh wow! We had quadruplets!
"Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something?"
"Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?"
Who?
"Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, ""Hey, where's Phillip?"" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!"
"Ah, I know.  I know he sucks  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?"
"Ogh, whatever.  The point is, Phillip and I are through.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money."
"HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  ""more serious"" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto."
"Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle."
"Alright, I'm here. Where do I-?"
My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.
Ditto!
"Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass."
Look closer.
"Uh. What? That's not the line, asshole!"
"Just do the bit right, dickface!"
I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!
"I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack!"
Here's a missile for ya!
"I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas."
What's going on here?
"Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too."
Me neither.
We sure did.
"No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault."
"No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone."
"Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you."
"Ohohoho, nohoho!"
"He sure did, Phillip."
"God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!"
Ey! There's some anthrax over there!
"Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something"
"Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion."
"Wait, before you do, pull my thumb."
"Hey Phillip, guess what?"
Faaart.
