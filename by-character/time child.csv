Hello?  Are you there?
"No, no, I have me.  All right, all right, listen! Listen to me carefully! You need to be patient!"
It's me.
Me you!
"I'm you in the future! You have to be patient and wait for the Nintendo Wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters!"
"It's not Kyle, it's you!"
"I'm trying to do you a favor, dumbass!! Just listen to me!"
What an asshole!
Butters? Butters!
"Butters, Butters! Listen to me! Just just listen. I'm about to come over to your house and ask you to help me freeze myself. Do not... do t!"
"No! This is not a joke! Whatever I say to you, Butters, no matter how hard I try, do not... do... what I tell you!"
No! Don't listen to me! Tell me to go screw myself!
"Aw damnit, just listen to me! If you freeze yourself, you're going to die!"
"No, you suck my balls!! Just listen to me for one minute!"
"Right before you left for Butters' house, you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde Frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right?"
"No, I am you, you stupid asshole!"
God I hate that guy!!
Hello? Kyle?
"Yes. Hello, Kyle. It's Eric. Uh, how's it going?"
"Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know, so I think maybe you're the only person who can understand this. You know how earlier today I asked you to help me freeze myself?"
"No, see, I know it's a stupid idea. Because, I actually did freeze myself.and... you were right, Kyle. It it backfired and I was frozen for 500 years, and now I'm calling you from the future."
"No, really, Kyle, I'm I'm seriously. Here, talk to my robot dog."
"No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right about now, I'm in my mom's freezer."
"... I will. I will suck your balls, Kyle. Just stop me from freezing myself, and I will get down on my knees, and I will suck your balls. I'll suck 'em dry, Kyle."
Kyle?  Kyle!
"Well I don't notice anything different, KIT-9! Do you?"
"Hm, I see...  Hey!"
Heeeeey!
By who?!
Hello? Hello? I know what you're thinking! Do not do it! You just need to be patient and wait the two months! Do you hear me?!
