Yo ho ho!
"Who's the boy that can laugh at a storm cloud?
Turn a frown into a smile for free?
Who's the kid with a heart full of magic?
Everyone knows it's Butters!"
"Who's the boy with the eyes full of wonder?
Who thinks being yourself is the best thing to be?
Who's that rascal with the tweezers in his pocket?
Everyone knows it's Butters!"
"Jumpin' in puddles, skippin' down the hallway
Pettin' at the petting zoo. He loves John Alway.
Who's that tyke with the cutest little dimples,
Battin' his eyes at every puppy he sees?
If you look inside yourself, you might be surprised when you find
A little boy named Butters!"
Everyone know it's Butters!
Everyone know it's Butters!
...Butters!
...Butters!
Everyone knows it's Butters!
Everyone knows it's Butters!
...Butters!
...Butters!
Everyone knows it's Butters!
Everyone knows it's Butters!

A hot-headed actor named Russell Crowe
He loves to act but he loves one thing more:
Fight-in' Round The World
He fights his directors and he fights his fans
It's a problem no one understands
If there's two things he love it's fighting and,
Fight-in' Round The World
Makin' movies, makin' music and
Fight-ing Round The World!
Russell Crowe'"
