"Welcome to Hollywood Minute. I'm Sandy Cervix and I'm deaf in one ear. It's been two weeks now since the prestigious voters of the Comedy Awards reversed their vote and said Germans were no longer the least funny people in the world. All thanks to the new ground-breaking German comedian, Funnybot.  It was after being voted the least funny people on the planet that the Germans first engineered Funnybot, a super automaton with perfect timing to within .0001 milliseconds. Since then, Funnybot has seen a meteoric rise to stardom, selling out standup theaters all over the world."
Funnybot has exploded onto the silver screen too.
"And this June, Funnybot shows off his range by playing every role in... Family Funbot"
"Funnybot, is there a line you won't cross?"
What's that? Could you say that in the other ear?
