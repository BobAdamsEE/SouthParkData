"Yeah, it sounds super-hard."
F-really?
Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.
"Ohhgh. Yeah, now I've got a total clue."
My clue's pointing over there now!
"Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing?"
Really?
"Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now."
"Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it."
Oofff.
I was getting a clue like every two minutes.
Bay-bay! I'm hot.
Tell me how was I to know?
Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...
The seasons change.
And the world goes round.
"'Cause I still love you, bay-bay!"
"Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience."
Blow what?
We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.
"So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?"
This is bullpucky!
"Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!"
We don't care about the company.
"Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings."
Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.
"Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage."
"No, Mr. Mouse."
Hello.
"Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel."
"Well. Um.  We, we wear these to symbolize how pure we are and how we ...um don't approve of things that are naughty or filthy."
Yeah. Uh huh.
Huh?
You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.
Come on guys.
"So Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?"
"Well, I gotta find somethin'.  My biceps are goin' flat."
Take it easy.
"Whatchoo got, Miller."
"...Alright, keep an eye on them. Let me know if anything changes. "
"It's a never-ending grind here at the NSA, and it seems there's never enough detectives to keep track of everyone.  Sergeant! What have you got, Larson."
"Alright, keep an eye on all three of them."
"If you think you got the stomach for this, then we can definitely use your help, young man."
What have you got?
We wanna talk to you about some tweets you've been tweeting.
"Yeah, we've heard of that. We've also heard of the Declaration of Independence. See, there's a lot of people out there who think like you, people who think their government doesn't have the right to go around poking their noses in the e-mails of its citizens. That is, until a plane flies into a couple of towers and a little girl loses her life. You wanna live in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, but the brave can't be free if the land isn't home, and that land won't be home so long as folks out there wanna take that American flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week, and as you're sittin' there on the toilet with the Star-Spangled Montezuma's Revenge there's one thing I can guarantee you."
You won't care who's checkin' your Twitter account then. 
"I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing.  Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker."
"Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange."
"Oh, lookie heeah!  I've gone and made a metal newspaper!"
"Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position!"
"You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town."
"And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it.  Your very own metal fuzzy dice."
"Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?"
Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.
"Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'."
"Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip.  Who could that be?"
The same.
"Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir."
"Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but-"
That's great news!
"I am, sir."
Pip!  A young gentleman! Of great expectations!
"Pip? Pip, old chap?"
That's right. You're safe and warm now.
"Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you."
"'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!"
"What's that, Pip."
Yeah!
"Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havisham!"
"Pip, she started the device!"
Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!
...There's too many of them!
"You did it, Pip!"
"Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?"
This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!
