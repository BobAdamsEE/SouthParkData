"E-excuse me, gentlemen, uh Tom Brokaw is here to see you."
Who's in charge here?
Where's the negotiator?
"All right, see what you can do."
They're coming out now?
"All right, that does it! You are in fact the worst negotiator I've ever seen in action!"
"Get out of here!  We'll get them the semi, and we'll get them the Worf guy. If they see that, thay'll come out and then, we could take them."
"Maybe so, but if we don't do something soon, there could be fifty, even sixty people who'll have to go without veal for dinner. Are you prepared to let that happen?"
All right. Where is Mr. Dorn?
"I'm sorry, Mr. Dorn. It's FBI business. We've got terrorists making demands and we need your help."
"All right boys, we have your truck. And we have an airplane on the tarmac at Denver International."
Do it!
"Alright, they're in front of the cattle ranch. Hit it!"
"Alright, boys! The game is over! Get out of the truck with your hands up!"
"Alright boys, just stay right there until your parents arrive."
"Ms. Stewart, we have some questions."
