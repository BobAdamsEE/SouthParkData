"Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed."
"I always love when Spring is on the way. Such a fun and inspiring time to decorate. Just like most women out there I've really gotten into queefing lately.  It's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays. What we're gonna do is just... cut out some paper... like... this...  and cut out little stars and little moon shapes,  and we're gonna just... jam those... up... and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores; they come in... little tube which make them very easy to just...  shoot... right up the ol'... there we are.. And of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive Easter grass. But the point is that when we're done we can... let one rip.  See how pretty that was? It's a good thing."
"Oh my God. Oh my God!  Steven! Steven, come quick!"
Look. It's him! It's... our son.
...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just knew the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy.
"Steven and I have a condition called ""torsonic polarity syndrome."" It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically."
"Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again!"
You're right. You're right.
"Hello, we're Mr. and Mrs. Thompson."
"Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?"
Oh thank you. Thank you!
Let's hurry!
"Yes. Yes, I see."
"...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up."
"Oh, Steven, it's like it's all happening all over again."
"Ah, agh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why.  We think perhaps she wanted a child of her own.
"We've tried every avenue to find him,  but, we've never tried the milk company."
Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us.
"Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again."
Amazing.
"Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition."
"Oh my, isn't this impressive?"
That's right.
This is the only photo we have of our little Tommy.
"Oh, son!"
"Oh, I'm so happy!"
