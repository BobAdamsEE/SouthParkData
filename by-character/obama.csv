"If there is anyone out there tonight who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer."
"It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America."
"Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. We will name him ""Sparkles""."
"Where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we canâ€™t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can."
"Thank you all for your support. If you don't mind, I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening getting some much needed rest.  Senator McCain."
Ohoh man that was perfect!
"You played it perfectly, there was no way."
Always workin' the angles.
"The Hope Diamond, rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world. Going street value, Middle-Eastern market, of course, two hundred and ten million dollars."
"Almost ungettable. The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, long considered to be the most thief-proof structure ever built.  The Diamond Wing Is protected by impenetrable walls of two-foot wide steel. On the northeast side, a seven-five laser system.  There's simply no side of the Smithsonian that can be breached."
Can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse.
We've spent ten years putting this plan together. If we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world-
-we won't get caught.
Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys?
"I'd like to see the Oval Office, please?"
"I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I wanna redecorate, if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff."
"I will need absolute privacy, is that understood?"
Thanks.
"All right, McCain. I'm in."
I'm already on it.  Boom baby.
"I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. I should be almost below the museum."
God she's awesome.
Oh no.  McCain? We've got a problem.
"Is there a problem, gentlemen?"
"Why wouldn't it be? I'm sorry, but I asked to be left alone?"
My wife?
"Uh, c-c-come on in, darling.  Thank, thank you boys."
"Michelle, there's something I need to tell you."
The laser system guarding the diamond was replaced by an optical relay three days ago.
"Did you catch that, Davis?"
Did you really not like pretending to be married?
Come on. You have to admit we had some fun.
"All right, everyone. We're about to go. So here's the revised schedule: 4:40 a.m., the team gathers at the northwest exit of the museum.  4:45 a.m., Michelle hacks the optical relay, allowing me access to the rear doors."
"4:46, from inside I can open the doors and let in the rest of the crew.  5:10 a.m., at the Department of Power Quincy shuts down the grid, disabling power to the vault room. 5:12, my grandmother who faked her death on Monday calls in a bomb threat to the museum."
"5:13, the guards open the southwest door, checking the museum for any bombs.  5:14, McCain, dressed as a football player, enters security and shuts off the diamond case alarm."
"Michelle and I head back into the tunnel and the hole is patched.  5:15 a.m., I walk out of the Oval Office with the diamond securely hidden in my anus."
All done. Thanks.
We hired a guy for that a couple of months ago.
"Hey uh, you guys go ahead. I just came to say goodbye."
"I decided to hang it up, maybe give this President thing a shot."
"Could have been I didn't make that flight.  What do you say, Michelle? Would you and your girls like to move into the White House with me? You know, settle down, just be President and First Lady for a while."
Who knows? Maybe we could change a few things. What do you say?
So we must keep our nation's youth away from money and success.
You mean boys will start working towards being rich and successful just so they can one day have sex with lots of women??
The birthplace of our country.
"Independence Hall... Independence Day... Aliens... Gentlemen, I might know what's causing the sex addiction outbreak. This is highly classified, but... in 1947 a flying saucer was discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. Two deceased alien bodies were recovered and hidden from public knowledge. They carried... a virus with them. A virus that only barely stopped from spreading all over the country."
It's the only explanation that makes any sense.
Which would mean that the alien is also a wizard.
Enough! We need to find the wizard alien and break his spell.
We have a turd in the punch bowl.
"Quick, give that boy a gun!"
"Alright, everyone to the stairwell. The bastard's gotta be upstairs."
"The alien wizard hiding out here! Come on, we've got tuh-"
Shoot it boys!
Keep shooting it!
"We watched... as sex addiction ran rampant through our country. It devastated families. But once again, our great country has risen up as one. The wizard alien... is dead. Sex addiction is no more. And if a rich celebrity is caught again trying to screw lots of women, we will know it isn't because men are just like that, it's because a wizard alien has cast his mighty spell."
