Everything is set. We have the detonator up and running.
You called and warned the government of our plans! What you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! We were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of America could attack!
Do you really think Muslims are behind this terrorist threat?!
"America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?"
Before that.
Before that.
Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!
"It was good knowing you, comrade."
"Yes, but we will be rich."
How did they find us?
It doesn't matter. The detonator is on a timer. You are too late! In three minutes!  What the hell?!
Oh crap.
No! I don't want to die without being paid!
