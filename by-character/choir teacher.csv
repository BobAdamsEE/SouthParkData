"Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison.  How are we all doing today?!  I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?!"
"Children, we are a national choir called, ""Getting Gay With Kids!"" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!"
"You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir  where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest."
"So, who wants to join the fun??"
Excuse me?
"Well, uh, that's all, really.  So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front."
"Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints."
"Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest."
And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
"Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo."
"Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San Jos√©, which is the capital of Costa Rica.  Oh! This is so exciting!"
"Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S."
"Eric, sit down!"
"Eric, SIT DOWN!"
"Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-"
"All right, that does it!  Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!"
"You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-"
"Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?"
Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
"Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow."
"Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?"
"We're the group singing for the ""Save The Rainforest"" summit tomorrow?  Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now.  Children, do any of you speak Spanish?  Don't you dare!"
Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.
Yeess!
"Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song."
"All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin."
"Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty."
"Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle."
"Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!"
"Eric, what the heck are you doing??"
"Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!"
"Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!"
"The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!"
"Stanley, what is it?"
Oh my God!!
"Jesus Christ, is he dead?!"
"Oh, no! God, no, no!  Don't panic, children."
"Maybe we came from that way.  No, nno. Let's try this way."
"Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!"
"Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?"
Who's not?!
"No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley."
"Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us."
