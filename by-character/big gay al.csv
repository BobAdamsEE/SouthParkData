"And so I said to the guy, ""you really think I'm paying that much?"""
Oh my God. I thought we were past this.
"Fellow homosexuals, I believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind. We must acknowledge that the words ""fag"" and ""faggot"" are never going to disappear. They're simply too much fun for everyone to say. But we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet, and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot Harley riders!"
"We should all be tolerant, but not with these fucking people! They really are faggots!"
"You can do it, boys! We believe in you!"
"Come on boys, you can do it!"
No one is killing anyone!  We've had enough! You faggots get the hell out of our town!
"Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al.  Have you been outcast?  Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us?  Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here."
"Hi little fella, how are you doing today?"
"I'm super, thanks for asking."
"Well, let's see. Come on in. Hmm."
We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion.
"And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!"
"Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Would you like to dance?"
"Young man, it appears you still don't understand."
"Come this way, I have to show you something."
"Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride.  Step aboard, Stanley.  Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time."
"You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan.  Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors. Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my!  Ohhh! Oh God, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely."
"Sooo, what do you think Stan?"
Isn't this precious?
No problem kids. Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?
"Oh Stan?  When you get back to town,  tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately."
"Ooh, my carrot cake!"
I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here.
"I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done.  Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you."
Hello scouts!
"Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list!"
"I just got transferred in.  I think everyone's here now, so we can get started.  Come on, Scouts. We've got work to do!"
"Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses.  Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone!"
So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy!
"And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: Motivational standup comedy.  Let's give him a big hand."
"Oops, guess we're out of time, kids. Now remember, tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money. We'll meet back here next Tuesday, and see who raised the most. Good luck."
Hi ya fellas!
"I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event. Yippie!"
"Well, stop the presses. Did you figure that out all by yourselves, silly buns?"
Out of... Scouts?
But I've been in Scouts since I was nine - it's a... huge part of my life.
I see...
What if I promise not to be gay anymore?  Pinky swear.
Right. Move on.
"Ah, bye, Scouts.  Okay, okay, Marc, stop playing now."
"I'm sorry. Sorry. But now I've packed everything away, so just... well, play something uplifting, like... ""I'm gonna put all this behind me and make it okay"" music."
"Oh!  Jesus, Marc."
Go away! I'm dead!
"I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts."
Really? wull-why?
Why not?
"Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals."
Thank you all very much. But I don't want this.
"Look, I appreciate what you kids did; I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If I'm free to express myself, then the Scouts have to be free to express themselves, too. I know these men. They are good men. They are kind men. They do what they think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I love them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club."
"Come on kids, let's go get some ice cream!"
"Say, honey, is that the pizza?"
"Slave, should I leave you two alone?"
Yes.
Oh that's not true! Colorado is about to pass a bill which allows same-sex marriage.
A new study?
