"Oh, no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all."
"Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected."

"Can I help you, young lady?"
"Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there."

"Now, if it's more of a lucid, speedy kind of high you're looking for, I do also carry the Daytab Cold and Flu. Then there's the maximum-strength Cortitussin Cough and Cold, but of course, that's only if you really want to trip balls."
"That's the spirit! All right, boys, I'll just need your parents' permission.  Kidding! I'm just pulling your legs. Come on over to the register."
