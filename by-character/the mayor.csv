"Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor."
"Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?"
Uh huh.
Of course.
"Naturally.  Oh, do go on."
You were saying?
"Oh, my!"
Uh now why would you say that?
So how does this thing work?
POVVVV?
"Ohhoho, brilliant.  Daah!! What the hell is this!!"
"OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD!"
"All right everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor, haa."
"Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab.  Come on, hurry up."
"Have a happy Thanksgiving! Let 'er rip!  Cuhome on, grab those cans little boy!"
"Now, let's see all the goodies you're going to take home to your family.  It...looks like he got a... a-a can of- string beans. Hehe."
"Chef, the turkeys!"
"People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys."
Come on! Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?!
Does my hair look okay?
"Ahem. Okay everybody, settle down."
"Okay, people, we clearly need to reach a compromise.  Perhaps we need a new icon for Christmas."
Ex-cuse me?
"Anyway, I'll put together a crack team of my best workers to make sure this'll be the most non-offensive Christmas ever - to any religious or minority group of any kind.  Are there any other suggestions?  Yyes, Mr. Garrison."
"No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid of all the Mexicans"
"Okay, people, we've got to turn this place around!  Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group!"
Is anyone offended by mistletoe?  Lose the mistletoe!
"Oh my God, what the hell is that thing?"
"And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison."
"And now, friends, it's time to present the Lifetime Conjoined Twin Achievement Award. This award goes to outstanding conjoined twins who have made a mark on society. And the winner is..."
Nurse Gollum!!
"As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation.  Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows!"
