"It's Canaada! On Strike!
Canada on strike! From Vancouver to St. John's ,
We raise our middle fingers for you all to sit upon!
And with our fingers up your ass,
you won't be very psyched
It's Canada! On Strike!
And we will not bow a bunch! Our resolve is strong!
We even took three hours to rehearse this striking song! 
Canada on strike! No matter where you are,
If you are Canadian then you've got to do your part!
March out of the halls!"
It's Canada! Canada! Canada! On Strike!
We want more! We want more!

"Good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck."
"Ding dong, they caught Saddam! Merry Christmas to the world!

Let's celebrate! Saddam Hussein's been caught!"
