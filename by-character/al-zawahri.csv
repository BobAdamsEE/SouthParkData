"We are so super pissed off at 'Family Guy'. 'Family Guy' isn't even that funny of a show. A jihad on 'Family Guy', and the 'Family Guy' nation!"
"Seriously, 'Family Guy' isn't even that well written. The jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. When this episode airs-our retaliation will be MASSIVE!!!!"
"""Family Guy"" better not show Mohammad tonight. I'm serious. ""Family Guy"" isn't funny."
"We warned you not to show Mohammad- But ""Family Guy"" did it anyways. So now, here is our retaliation on America!!!"
"Oh yeah, take THAT! We burned you! THAT WAS WAY FUNNIER THAN FAMILY GUY."
