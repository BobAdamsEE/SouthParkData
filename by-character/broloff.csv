"Thank you, Senator. For over a hundred years, the European Fecal Standards and Meas-"
"Das shpoitenhoff?  Ahhh ladies and gentlemen, I understand we have just received a special video-taped announcement from Bono!"
"Could we play the tape on the big screen, please?"
"You heard it, ladies and gentlemen! The official biggest crap is... 9.5 Courics! Congratulations to Bono!"
Marsh is attempting to break the record again. We thought you should know.
Well he's going to try.
"Bono, we've never had that rule before."
"I believe that's true. We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but, if you cannot crap out the crap, it's not really a crap."
"Well congratulations, Bono, it appears your record is intact."
"It's too late, Bono. The boy has learned the truth."
"It's true, I'm afraid. You see, until Mr. Marsh came along, I was the record holder for the biggest crap. I took it back in 1960. It was the most amazing crap I'd ever taken."
"Come to me my... darling precious child.  After I had broken the record I took the crap home. I was so proud of it that I... decided to keep it, to try and raise it like a child."
"There there, my little crap.  Don't cry.  Here, do you want the biddy? Hm?  Does Bono want the biddy?  Yes, he likes the biddy doesn't he?"
"I kept the crap in my office, nursed it, fed it biddy. And soon biddy made him strong. Biddy made him grow up! Into one of the most influential figures of our time.  Easy Bono, that hurts the biddy."
"My little crap has accomplished many things. But he could never shed the fact that he was really... a number two. So he spent his life trying to be number one, in everything."
Have I?!  Look at the crap I took all those years ago! Bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 Courics in weight! No matter how you look at it he IS still the record!
