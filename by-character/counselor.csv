"Hi, Towelie?"
"Towelie is definitely one of the most addicted towels we've ever seen here. He's probably the second most psychologically damaged towel I've come across since treating Kirstie Alley's towel, which, had seen some... uuff, some nasty stuff."
"Hi boys. My name is Ms. Gorache and I need to ask you a few questions about your priest, okaaay?"
Okay. Would you say that Father Maxi is... nice? Or mean?
"Okaaay, what words would you use to describe your priest?"
"Okay. And did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt?"
"You don't need to be ashamed or embarrassed. Just, did he ever try to put anything in your butt?"
"No, no. Did he ever try to put anything that belonged to him in your butt?"
