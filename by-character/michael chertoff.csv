"Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions. I'm talking of course about Peruvian flute bands.  The red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of Peruvian flute bands are. All over the world, wherever there are tourists or shoppers, there are now, on average, 65 Peruvian flute bands per square kilometer. General?"
Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands. We will need every resource available to see this through.
Senator?
"You heartless bastard! This country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity! And we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by Peruvian flute bands! Is that clear?!  As director of Homeland Security, I am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained."
Attention Peruvian flute bands:
We appreciate your cooperation and patience.
Tomorrow you will be boarding ships...
...which will take you to Guantanamo Bay.
There you will spend the rest of your lives.
"Calm down people, we still have work to do! We have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again!"
"Well think about it, idiot! Where else would ""Peruvian"" flute bands come from?"
The country is in the name!
"Not Peruvian, retards, Peru! It's right here!"
Now I want a plan in place to take out Peru once and for all!
Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us  unless they are stopped at the source!
See?  God damn it!
The Llama Brothers: Tapas and Moodscapes.
"Right. You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a llama, but you're not a Peruvian flute band."
Which tourist location were they playing at?
Let me talk to you guys out here.  Well what do you think?
I agree. They're obviously some kind of... hybrid.
"Well however they came to be, they're about the only piece of good luck we've had."
"If they are the hybrid we're talking about,  then they could be our way of taking out Peru once and for all."
"All right, here's the deal: Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us... we'll get you home."
You're able to walk amongst the Peruvian flute bands. They see you as one of them. We are going to send you to their Capital.
"We still don't know whose side you're on! You do this, and we'll know! You leave for Peru in the morning."
"You don't have a choice! Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands."
Oh? And what might that be?
Guinea pigs?
"You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis, did you know that?"
"I really thought you had me in Miami, but you just couldn't quite put the pieces together."
"Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis, and I can't let you interfere.  Sorry my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen. The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising, and the only person who could have stopped all this... is on his way to the middle of nowhere."
What about the pan flute bands? Are they on their way to Guantanamo Bay?
Have they been loaded onto the boats or not?!
That was an order!  The pan flute bands were to be put on boats to Guantanamo last night!  I am still in charge here! I want those pan flute bands on the boats to Guantanamo!
And how are the efforts to contain all this going?
"Ah I'm sorry, I just thought of a funny joke."
"All right, get the jets ready. I need to get to Machu Picchu."
"Yes, I need to be taken to Machu Picchu! Have you lost your hearing?!"
Am I in charge or not?!
Wait here a minute.  Behold! I am standing on your precious land! I've waited a long time for this!
What of your prophecy now?! Nothing can stop me!  Craiiig!  No! How did you get here?!
Shoot them!
They're a Peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained.
I said shoot them!
"Damn you Craiiig! You just don't ever stop, do you?!"
"You see, for thousands of years horrid creatures have lived in the Guinea Valley of Peru. The Incas learned how to keep the creatures at bay: by playing pan flute music. Guinea creatures hate it even more than humans do. But the prophecy foretold that one day the creatures would be unleashed and I have made that happen! The Incas predicted the world would be saved... by Craig. But that part of the prophecy will not come true! For you will all die on this mountain!"
"Oh, I'm much more than that. Guinea bees, guinea rabbits, guineasaurus rexes, I am something much more evil!  Arrrgh."
"Dargh, no!"
"Argh, curse ye, Craig. Dar, argh."
