I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit.
It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before.
In Montreal.
"Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!"
"Well, I will!"
"Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association."
"No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted to let you know that I'm onto you."
I am going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass!
Perfect. The trap is set.
"Thank you for helping out, gentlemen.  If this sting operation works, some bogus tooth fairies should be showing up to take the sick kid's money. When they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm will sound, and that's when you hit the button, Murphy, and activate the lights. Everybody got it?"
"Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled."
Let's move out!
"Give it up, kids. You're surrounded by dentists."
That's right. And now it's all exposed! You're through! The only thing left to do is to haul all you kids down to prison!
What the hell?
Let's get outta here!
