"You guys, you guys."
Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
I think...  I think he wants to have sex with me.
I gotta- I gotta go.
"Kyle, the person leaving."
Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.
"Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!"
It's a miracle!
"Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time."
I've got better things to do.
I'm just gonna stop playing.
No.
"All right all right, I'll do it!"
Whoa...
I don't know.
Dude.
What?
Oh my God. Oh Christ no!
"Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!"
Yes they are!
This is so... embarrassing.
I have... I have AIDS.
"But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!"
...Sick!
Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
"Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over."
What? What are you gonna do to him?
"You guys, wait."
I... nothing.
"Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students."
Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!
Ow.
"You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?"
"Wait, wait!"
What?
"Wait a-wait a minute, what?"
"No, I got it done."
He won't make it.
This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by.
"Hey, he's here."
If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.
"All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!"
What number am I on?
Me?  I'm the cutest?
"Hey, what's goin' on?  What's goin on? Hey.  Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice."
"Hey, what's goin' on?"
Hey.
What's goin' on?
"Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay?  You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too, but look what he accomplished.  Chin up, cowboy.  Hey, what's goin' on?"
"Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks."
"Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too."
...Oh...
Why are they doing this?!
"Oh God, what have they done?!"
Whyyy? Whyyy??
What do we do?
"Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything."
"I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school."
"And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End."
Oh boy here we go!
"You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2."
Who's the male lead?
"Yeah, so do I."
"I don't know, it's just a cool costume."
Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.
I threw up on my way home.
Hey.
Yes.
Yes.
He's the most awesome kid in school!
Somalia? Where's that?
"Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join."
And your mom is okay with that?
Yeah maybe we should think about this.
This is Somalia?
You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr!
No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
Hard to port!
I hate it here and I wanna go home!!
"You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars."
She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.
So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.
Wow wee.
"Hey, here he comes!"
Me too.
Alright.
We're just having a hard time finding him.
We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.
We don't know. He's everywhere.
But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.
"Dad, is Slash real or make-believe?"
Slash isn't real.
He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.
You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real.
"Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash."
One of our parents.
One of our parents!
I just can't believe how yummy these are.
I was enthralled with the dialog exchange.
"Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants!"
Oh grow up.
A toilet?
"Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?"
"Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?"
Mom?
Why?
"Mom, I'm in class."
"But she's not gonna die, is she?"
"Mom, I'm sorry."
Mom?
So that's it?
Mom?
That's not what I said.
"You guys, check this out!"
You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!
"You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bullcrap bullying video!"
What's she look like?
I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.
"Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit."
"We don't have a coach, Kyle."
"Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters."
Lying jerk!
There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.
Yes you do.
What's Shitter?
How many people are on Shitter?
The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
Which nobody can afford.
"Hey yeah, I know.  How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?"
Just find out who they're loyal to.
The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.
Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.
"Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony."
Nobody saw that coming.
The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.
At least she didn't try to sit on him. 
"Hey Token. Token, check out my girlfriend. "
"Yeah, we just started dating seriously.  You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek?"
"Yeah, I know. "
"Oh, thanks, guys. "
"That's not very nice, Wendy."
"It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. "
"Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys."
I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.
Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.
"Awe, come on, lay off him guys."
"No, no, just he is."
"What are you doing, Butters?"
"Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?"
Yeah.
Oh.
Dow!
"Ah, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time."
Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?
Make him stop!
What's it look like?
"Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?"
Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever?
"Owww, you bit my arm!"
Brainnns. Ahh.
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Me too.
I bet I can spit the most on him.
Whoa.  Is that Wendy Testaburger?
"Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?"
Hooray for Eric!
I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
"Naw, you're not fat."
Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!
I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
Denver?
What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?
Oh.
I hope my dad doesn't sing.
I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
"Yes. Yes, please!"
Bitchin'.
"Hey, what's going on?"
"Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago."
I guess they don't wanna fight.
"Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?"
"Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight."
Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!
Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander
What's that?
What? She die or something?
Oh boy! Here we go!
All that build-up for nothing.
"Programs, get your programs here. Programs."
Hababah...
Wow! I wanna sue somebody!
"Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls!"
Um...
We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.
"Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are."
Huh?
I'm not fat.
"Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned."
So I don't get to be on the team now?
Right here.
"For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit!"
"Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you."
Right.
"Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell."
...We've gotta get to that church before we die.
Like what?
"Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down."
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, now what?"
"Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?"
Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
"Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time.  Alabama, in the late 1800s"
Oh.  Cool! He's here!
That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw.
"Yeah, and it's from Broadway."
We're never gonna outdo them now!
I've got three.
Who's Scott Tenorman?
"Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming."
Thank you.
Oh.
Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
"There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out."
You mean they both have butts instead of heads?
"Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow."
Wwooww.
...What if we don't want to be your friend?
This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!
"Hey Token. You know, I never noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool."
That is an awesome answer!
"Wow, hellafun. That's awesome."
It's weird how we never noticed before.
"You try it, Bebe."
"Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-"
"Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-"
Hoh hoh hoh!
"My paper is called, ""Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever."""
Hoh!
"""My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end."""
Chase his tail? That must be so funny?
Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?
We're tryin' to get Bebe to run for class president.
What?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Bebe! Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe!
Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid!
Let's never let boobs come between us again!
Look at those ridiculous things!
What do you guys want?
"Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you?"
So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.
"Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble."
"Faragon, asshole!"
"And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please?"
"Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody."
"That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black."
"What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic?"
"One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. This must be returned to the video store from whence it came."
There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!
Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf.
"It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard , the dwarf , the warrior , the cleric , and the Jew ."
Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.
I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.
Nobody wants to touch it.
And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?
Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
"Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out!"
"Yeah, go kick his ass."
Let me see.
From the nice guy at the county fair.
Then fight us!
Butters!
Butters!
But we like being the Cows!
What do you guys want?
I haven't decided yet.
Sure.
I'm still not totally sure.
That we can go back to being the South Park Cows!
"Yeah, and it was called Man from Atlantis, and he had like, webbed fingers..."
"Put it, put it up on the, monitors!"
"Aaaaah, owieeee, owieeee."
"I don't know, that looks pretty high up."
What happens to the lion cubs?
"Yeah yeah, come on!"
Did it hurt?
Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.
I never realized ignoring him was an option.
"Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now."
I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement.
"YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS!  NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!"
Where did they get that thing?
"It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with."
Nice.
You're gonna be fine.
"Good luck, man."
"Then, he's already dead."
How come you get to use it first?
Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.
"Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure."
I am.
Right this way!  You can't eat in the cafeteria!
You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.
Right. And you're a ginger.
"Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming."
Uh... Gi... ginger kids! AAAAAH!
...A whale. Talked to you.
"Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!"
"Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass."
Mexico has a space program?
We're busted.
"Oh Jesus, they're here!"
"Yeah, me too."
