"Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here!"
Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't-
"Mr. Garrison,  these three boys were caught playing hooky."
This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time.
UFO's?
That is the silliest thing I've ever heard.
"That, that was a pigeon."
There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.
"Hold it right there, cows!  Come back here! Now then!"
"Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now. 
I love to sing-a
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a
I love to sing-a
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a..."
Nice Gun.
"Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet."
No problem.  Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee.
What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute.
"Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ..."
"Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!"
"Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?"
You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee and nobody got hurt.
"Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please."
"OK, any questions?"
That's enough out of you!
This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
"You boys have been watching the ""X-Files"" too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone -"
"Whoa!  Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here."
Carry on.
You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.
Not a thingy-dingy.
"Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle?"
Righty-o.
"Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos."
"Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister."
What?
Yyess.
What seems to be the problemo here?
"Boys, shouldn't you be in school?"
"No excuses, move along, you little troublemakers!"
Well what?
"Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass!"
"Hoh, what a bitch!"
Huh?! Where?!
"Oh my God, look!"
"Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking."
"Hey, I thought of something.  Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction."
"That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys."
Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
"Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong."
"Oh, yeah. Let's go."
"Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator."
"Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town."
Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of.
"Okay, I'll be quick, then."
"Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef."
"Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too."
That would be super-duper!
"Oh, neato!"
Who?
Pain.
Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?
"Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babeuhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah"
"Holdjit  If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?"
Odle-oh who whoo?
"Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business."
"Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor."
What's all the hoo-ha?
Why?
"If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.  What do you have to say, carnival operator?"
"Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!"
Barbrady!
You said Buttbaby.
"Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists."
What's all this?
"Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?"
"Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?"
"Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans!"
"All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with-  Oooooh?"
Yeah.
"Uh me, too."
I didn't?
"Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison."
"Well, there's been a report of a few missing people."
"Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them."
"No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?"
"Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?  Well, this all looks in-  oh? Tennis anyone?"
"Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions."
-crack corn and I don't careJimmy crack corn and I don't careMy master's gone awayJimmy crack corn and I don't care
"Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then."
"Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor."
"No. Just leave me with my dignity.  Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here."
"Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room."
Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-
T. T is for turtle.  Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur...
"Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants."
Who are you?
"Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters."
"Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI."
"Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!"
"Wow, they've got activists for everything these days."
"Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking."
"Well okay. Next?  Next?  Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers...  Okay, next?  A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!"
These are a weapon!
I'll think of a way. Now move along!
"Alright, next!  Okay, clear."
Uh what the hell was that?
"Hello, Mr. Marsh."
"Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property."
Me?? How did I get into this mess?
I am. But I don't want to be.
"Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator."
But isn't that dishonest?
"Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you"
What you do mean?
Crime scene investigation!  There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator?
Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.
You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!
Aha!! Got you!
Insurance?
Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.
No I do not.
I just need to talk to someonen who knows how toilet paperers think.
"Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police."
I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?
"Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?"
"You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh."
"Well, that's kind of personal."
"Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know."
So you think there was more than one. Why?
"Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt!"
"Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene.  I'm... sorry I have to do this."
Is this toilet paper from your store?
Positive ID on the toilet paper.
"Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?"
"Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern."
"Josh, I need your help."
How do you mean?
Yes.
"No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you?"
To get revenge.
What do you mean?
"I don't have time for this, kid."
Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps!
Oh. Of course! One of her students!
Hello boys. How are you?
It sure is!
"Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked."
His parents are on their way down now.
Why do you say that?
"All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by."
Huh??
"Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now."
"Excuse me, everyone.  I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house!  Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person."
"Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?"
"Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation."
"Okay, Josh, time to go back to the...  Oh no!"
Couldn't you have gone after him?
Police station.
"Josh? Josh, where are you?!"
"Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence."
Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!
There you are!
"Eric Cartman, you are under arrest."
I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.
"Oh no, you're coming downtown!"
You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.
"I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz."
Yeah.
Jimmy? Jimmy Valmer?
"Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside."
"Not perform?  But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that."
Why?
"Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex."
"Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point."
"Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody."
"You're welcome, Jim.  Wait..."
Oh God.
