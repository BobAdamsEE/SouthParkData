It's time for us to start playing to older people. Maybe we need to be edgier. Have a little sex appeal.
"I'm an artist. And if all I ever do is play to kids, then I'll be a joke.  I have to move on. "

I'm done being a kiddie star!
"Thanks. Oh my, here we go! "
"Come on, Ike. Ike?"
"Come on, come on, and pound my strange. Pound it like this,  pound it like that."
