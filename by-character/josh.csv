Lisa I had a really great time tonight.
Would you... mind very much if kissed you?
'Scuse me?
"Oh, it's a talking squirrel.  Oh!"
Oh! Ow! Wugh! Oh!
Ugh! L-lisa! Call me! Oh! Ow!
Oh that really stings.
"Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?"
"Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah."
"Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm."
"Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah."
"Yeah, so the problem is your Margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big Margaritaville security, yeah, no. Yeah. No. Yeah..."
You folks enjoying the condo?
"Well, best to do it and get it out of the way."
That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity!
Wow!
"Share,  time.  Time share."
"Try it. Try saying it. ""I've got a little place in Aspen."""
It's downright smart!
"It's nice to feel rich, isn't it."
And then share it with the people who come tomorrow.
They got the red sticker?!
"Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes."
We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about!
And we certainly don't want to pressure you.
I know! Have you ever considered going in on a time share?
That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!
Sit!
"""What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?"""
"Nice to meet you, ""Mom and Dad."""
"That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer. You should try something more... casual."
And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?
Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome that becomes.
"No, but it was worth a try, wasn't it?  Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town. You must have had larger inspirations. What happened to those... big-city dreams?"
"Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what I want to know. And I'll help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house."
"Are those the crime scene photos? Let me see them.  Yes. Yes. Not bad work, not bad at all. These toilet-paperers are professionals...at least one of them is."
"Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?"
"Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man."
"The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it."
"Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?"
Single-sheet?
Why does one toilet-paper houses
"No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation."
"Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man?"
Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool hiyouse?
"Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art."
"Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've got some arrests to make.  Fly fly flyyy. Fly fly flyyy."
"No, sir."
"What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?"
"Ooo, Polceman Brown, never quite made officer. Why is that, Polceman Brown?"
Hello Officer Barbrady.
"I'm afraid that giving away my location might be harmful to my freedom, officer. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get out of that dingy cell."
"Sorry, officer, gotta run. There's something I've been meaning to do for quite some time. Ciao."
"Oh, hey Randy. What happened to you??"
Mm-my  daughter has elephantitis
