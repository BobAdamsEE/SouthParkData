"Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski."
Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town!
"We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him!"
"No, no, wait a minute,  that's ridiculous.  What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see?  If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it."
Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!
You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now!
"Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!"
"...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?"
Hehey!
Butters!
Butters! What are you doing?!
"Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this!"
"Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?"
"Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious."
"You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters."
"Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious."
You see?
"What can I do, Father?"
A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.
Thank you so much for taking him in.
"There you are, Butters!"
What's he done now?!
"Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change."
Well you know somethin'? So do I.
"And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere."
What happened?
No. All the phone lines are completely down.
We can't just leave them out there.
This isn't happening!
Ask her what's happening.
I knew they'd come back for us!
Why are they turning?
They're... they're leading them away!
"Oh, hey Randy."
I've never heard of one that big.
"Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!"
But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!
Hey. Hey that's right.
"Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!"
"That's great, Randy!"
"Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!"
Hooray for Gerald!
"Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald."
"What is it, dear?"
A penis?
"Now darling, calm down."
"Hoh, women. Always afraid of penises."
"Oh, it's just a little penis, darling."
Your teacher's penis?
"Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?"
"Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out."
"Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?"
Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report.
It could come back.
"Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?"
Go go go go back the other way!
Oh God look!
Get off the roof!
"Look, I I need we need to find a way out under the city."
There's something over there!
"Oh, shut up!"
"No. No, this can't happen! No!"
"It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead."
"Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu..."
Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark.
I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!
"I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya!"
"All right, damn you! The children can come in!"
"It's still here, ih... it's all still here."
"No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right."
"You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?!  It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?!  Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!"
I'll tell you why!  Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!
"What keeps a family together, Butters?!"
"That's right!  If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!"
You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!
"There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?!"
"Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister!"
"That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!"
"All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna-  Ah!"
"Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey!  Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!"
"Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  One! Two!  Uhh, Bu-Butters?"
"AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!"
"All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!"
"He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground."
What?
That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.
"Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!"
"Butters, you are grounded!"
"It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more."
It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!
"The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills."
"Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us."
There! Look!  It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.
He's... paying for everyone's debts.
Butters?
"A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil."
"Oh hey Peterson, buying fishsticks, I see."
"What are you, Peterson? A gay fish?"
"Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone."
Can you believe it?
Huh?
"There you are, Butters!"
"Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend?  Sally Darson?"
"John Lennon's dead, Butters."
Really amazing.
Hello Matt
"Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented."
"Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course."
But we are very very proud nonetheless.
"Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!"
Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.
Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!
"And what about the families of the victims of 9-11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!"
Aaagh! Get it off of me!
Shoot it!
"Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?"
"That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?"
What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!
Don't talk back to me!
"Go up to your room, now!"
Butters started an Asian turf war!
"I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda."
Well Dr. Janus?
"Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?"
Oh God the medication isn't working!
Butters! Butters!!  BUTTERRRRS!
You're back. You're back-he's back!  I love you son!
You're going to be okay Butters! You hear me?! YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY!
What was the show about?
Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.
"I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect.  What a tragedy she had to leave us so soon. But I'm sure Betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere, just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet."
"Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat?"
"Well, speak of the devil."
"Well, sure, I guess. We'll go make some tea."
"Our Linda certainly knows her way around a pork.  What's the matter, Butters?"
Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham.
I'll get it.
"Your friends wanted to see you, Butters."
"Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night."
"All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it."
"And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done!  Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to ""Oh, who don't we just drink each other's cum?""! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!"
We'll talk about that when you're older!
What?!
"Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend."
"How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who clearly has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything!"
"Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore!  This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: I had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with me now."
I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell.
"Just let me sign.  All right, he's coming to you."
You should have never come to our town!
What?!
How?
"Son of a bitch, it's him all right!"
He's stopping at another house.
"Yes, we found that in his pocket."
"Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!"
"Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?!"
Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua.
"Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault."
It has to do with... biology.  You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids.
You probably think Butters seems somehow... different.
It's because he is.  His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place.
"Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing."
"It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do!"
You know that's not allowed!
"Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa."
"No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters.  A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i."
"Only haoles pronounce it Hawaii, Butters, but those of us from Hava'i are a very special people. We have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive.  We drink chi-chi's from the coconut. We eat poke that the Safeway provides. And when we've chosen a mate, we marry at the fern grotto, as your mother and I did so... very long ago. As a Stotch, Butters, you are actually Hawaiian royalty. Your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the King."
"Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called ""hapahui apahoha"", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone.  Take this, son. It is our Mahalo Rewards card. It will provide you with all you need. And now I must turn my back on you."
Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!
Well? Any luck?
"No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?"
"We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price."
I'll never give up!  I don't even remember doing this! Just leave me alone!
"Aw, go to hell, you griefer!"
Oh my God! These people don't even know!  Hurry! You gotta go!
Get out! You're not safe!
Hurry! You gotta go!
"Well that was a lot of fun. Thanks for inviting us, guys."
"Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way."
"No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up."
"Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes.  Honey, our Handicar is here."
Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad.
Download the app! It works great!
"Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila."
"You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in.  I'm telling you Gerald, havin' a Handicar is a grat way to make some money on the side."
Timmy!
"The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald."
Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!
"Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry.  Hold on, sorry, went too far.  This is your opportunity to make Handicar thee transportation of thte future. Think what you could do with all that money."
Butters?
"Butters, are you home??"
What are you talkin' about?
Hey now hold on. I am a drone hobby enthusiast. I would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct.
"I assure you, my drone is sitting in the garage. I'll show you."
"There, you see? It's right there. "
I swear I didn't fly it.
Butters?
"Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage?"
"Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you."
"Yes, I'd like to return this drone. "
"Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore."
"Look, something's wrong with it. It does things, it...  flies by itself."
"You don't understand. It was in the garage and the battery was fully charged. Someone said they'd seen it flying around, so I checked.  The battery was half empty."
"Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about."
You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything.
"No, it's impossible. He's not allowed to fly it without my supervision. "
Randy. We need to talk.
"Inside.  I've been going over it and over it in my head. I thought Butters and I were alone, but then I saw you on the news.  Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast didn't recall doing. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts?"
"I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them."
"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy??"
"If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby."
Please do not adjust your televisions!
"My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby.  All of you with drones, please listen to me. Three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the Internet. We all were told to respectfully not watch the video. But on the page,  it has over three hundred million views, so if none of us watched it, who did?  We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us!"
Time to end this hobby once and for all!  No! NOOOO!
"We're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said ""No more!"" Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children's children will still be telling stories about how Craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away. "
"There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?!"
I know that! What do you-?
Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh!
"What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!"
"Oh no, mister! You are GROUNDED! "
Butters?! Who is that?!
"Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember why Butters is grounded? What what did he do?"
"It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he is grounded.  And no bouncing the racquetball either!"
Butters!
What are your friends doing here?!
"You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!"
Well you're getting it now!
Oh my gosh! Linda!
It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore.
No. I've I've got to tell him!  Butter? Butters! 
"You can go outside and play, son."
"No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over."
I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it?
Where... where am I?
Well how gay is he?
Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?
"Alright, you can take the paper bag off."
"Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!"
Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious!
Put that bag back on!
Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth!
"Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!"
"Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!"
"I'm just checking in on you, Butters.  Heh- Do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded!"
Jacking it? Jacking what?
WHAT?! Are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?!
OH YOU'RE GONNA GET IT MISTER! Just Wait until I get home!
"DON'T YOU HI MOM AND DAD US YOU LITTLE PUNK!!! ""(Punch)"""
YOU THINK YOU'RE TOUGH NOW?! ANSWER ME!!!
"Yeah. We figure that if our boys are goona be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too."
"Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!"
Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend!
"Here we are, everyone."
What's the red sticker?
O-all right!
"Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company?"
"Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo!"
"I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ...did... just say a thirty-minute presentation."
"Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office."
What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing?
"Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth."
"Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!"
...Same thing.
What the hell is this?!
Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?!
"What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son."
"Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib."
"We thought the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son!"
Well well well! I had to see it to believe it!
"Don't you ""Hi, Dad"" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!"
"Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady."
And that's your excuse?!
"Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!"
O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago.
Girlfriend?
"Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone."
You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay.
"I, don't know."
"Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money."
"Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?"
"You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession."
Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes.
It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over.
"What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?"
I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.
I think it's best we try to reason with it.
Butters?
"Butters, what is wrong with you??"
"Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now!"
"Butters, play!  Start playing right now, young man!"
"Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life."
"What happened to him, Doctor?"
"Now, honey, we were trying to read."
"Butters, never get into a car with a stranger! Unless it's a limousine."
"Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?!"
Your girlfriend?
"Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money?"
"Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son!"
"So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels."
Butters is our son. He's not for sale.
Excuse me?!
"Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk."
"Butters, right now!"
"Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents not to consider it."
"I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family."
"Yes, us, the rest of the family."
"Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton."
"Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and... while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars.  It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front."
"All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay."
"It's called ""working"" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!"
"That should keep him busy for a while while we get this transaction finished. Now, Ms. Hilton, how should we start?"
"Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal?"
"Oh, well, too bad.  Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her."
"So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!"
You're a grounded old bear.
Who's seeing dead people?
"Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts."
"Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you."
Yeess.
That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS.
That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years.
So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS.
"Butters, what is going on?!"
Well you'd better stop having nightmares or eles you're gonna be grounded!
Butters! What have you done?!
"No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him."
"Now do you believe us, Butters?"
Butters?!
There's our boy.
Everyone into the community center! Hurry! Go!
"This is all your fault, Jimbo!"
"Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?!"
Jesus.
"Randy, Randy! Your son's on the phone!"
Let me go too.
I can't go on! Feel so... hot.
"Yes? What is it, officer?"
"Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks."
"Linda? Linda, please come downstairs."
"Oh butter! Oh Butters, I miss you so much!"
Who are you?
Bring him back? W-What are you talking about?
Indian... Burial Ground?
"You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury him at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I-"
"Hello son. Don't you worry. Daddy's gonna make everything all right again.  There he is. There's my boy! Come on, Butters!  Oh... Butters... you smell like... bacon  Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son. We're gonna bring you back!"
"I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest chance it would bring him back! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anymore!"
"Linda, I did it for you, you wanted him back so much! So did I!"
It's him.
"It's gone, dear. It's gone. Forgive me."
"Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?!"
"Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son."
"Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. You're an abomination."
"Yes, it must feed."
"Oh yes, thank you for coming."
Just follow me to the basement.
"Here you go, son. Eat!"
Come on. Don't watch it eat.
