"We all know that bullying has become an epidemic. Like AIDS, bullying is escalating and is spread mostly by penises. But now a few school kids are trying to make a difference with a video to make bullying kill itself.  I'm joined by the film's director as well as the weak little boy who's the main subject of the film. Stan, congratulations on all your success."
And how about you? What would you like to say to your bully out there?
"Come on, this is for everyone who's been a victim. What do you wanna say to bullies all across America? Go ahead.  Right now. Say it."
"Do you hear that, bullies? Stop making kids say things on your TV shows!  What else do you wanna say, Butters?"
"Leave him alone! But that doesn't work, does it Butters?"
Tell us in graphic detail what the bully does to you?!
"Come on, this is for America!  Do you realize that in America, ohohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to go to school because of bullying?!  Don't you care?! You'd better care!"
