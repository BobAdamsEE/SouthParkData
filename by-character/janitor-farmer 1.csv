Did you know we're livin' in the Tween time?
Guess it's the period between 2009 and 2013. They call it the Tweens. So they got this feller down at the bowling alley? He gets up on the stage an' shits his britches.
I don't know. But he gets up there and strums a gueetar and then starts loadin' his britches up like it's goin' out of style.  It's like some kind of britches holocaust. Feller calls himself Steamy Ray Vaughn.
Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.
I told you. Them britches don't stand a chance.
That there's Steamy Nicks.
"Nnooh, that's Stevie Nicks. Steamy Nicks just shits her britches."
I agree. Why don't you leave them poor britches alone?
Sound like Steamy Ray Vaughn is goin' at it with his wife over Steamy Nicks.
"We got to now, if their fightin' is our best chance tuh save them britches."
"Come on britches, we're settin' you free."
