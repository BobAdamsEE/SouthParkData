"Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've followed the Mormon faith, and so you've been let in!"
"And then, Brother Stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie."
I'm so grateful for that.
"Yes, would you?"
"Well, he seemed like a nice fellow."
"We're glad you made it, brother."
