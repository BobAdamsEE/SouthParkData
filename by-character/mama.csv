"Her favorite foods are sketti and butter, and she likes drinkin' Red Bull and Mountain Dew."
"Come on! Come on now, Boo Boo!  Now get up and wave to them judges!  We ain't got no shame about our weight, 'cause our weight makes us sassy."
"Well, the doctor said Honey Boo Boo needs a heart transplant. They're gonna do a surgery and put a pig heart in her, so, we're going to the ranch to pick out a hog."
"Honey Boo Boo is gonna do pageants with a pig heart, we wanna pick a hog that has pizzazz and knows how to work it, girl!"
We've been in the OR about two hours already. I just hope when she does her pageants the judges don't take away points 'cause she's got a pig heart.  Honey Boo Boo!  Honey BOO BOO!
What you gonna tell them judges if they ask you about your heart?
Who waunts sketti and butter?  She got a pig heart an' now she thinks she's a pachyderm. Show 'em your scar!
Ain't nobody can beat my Boo Boo at sketti wrestlin'!
"I don't know, I... How did I let myself go like this? What have I done??"
