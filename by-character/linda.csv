"Oh my God, Stephen, we've left Butters."
So what happens now?
He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls...
"Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?"
"It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?"
Okay.
"What's going on, you two?"
Huh?
Closing it down? They can't do that.
The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.
We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.
Really?
"Anything, Stephen?"
"You have to let them in, Randy."
"No, no wait, there's still a box over here."
"Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay."
"Randy, what are you doing?"
"And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?"
All right!
Our darling Butters never came home last night.
"You are grounded, mister!"
"Way to go, champ."
What is that?  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Stephen! Stephen come quick!
A penis is loose in our kitchen!
Yes! It just ran across the floor!
Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!
"There! There, you see it?"
I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases.
AAAAAAAAH!!
"What is that? Chris, what is that?"
Stephen!
"You don't know that, Stephen!"
"Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy."
You just march on in there.
"Butters, what have you done to your hair?"
What on Earth?
Butters?
"Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?  Unbelievable! He's locked the door."
"Stephen, what has happened to our boy?"
"We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home."
Hi everyone.
"Butters, what are you doing?"
Your T.M.I.?
"Butters, put your clothes on."
"Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small?"
What's going on?
"Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?"
What?
Oh my God!
"Oh, poor Butters!"
"Stephen! Stephen, come quick! It's butters!  Look!"
Now he thinks he's a truck driver.
"To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close."
"I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard."
"Butters, what happened to your eye?"
Here we go.
And your favorite lemon bars.
"Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe.  I just love the cute little canarian on the dial. And, every hour it chimes."
How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!
"Stephen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!"
Then we can go with him.
You don't use Handicar?
"Butters, why?? Oh my God!"
"Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings."
"What is it, Stephen?"
He's not?
What is that? WAAH What do you want from us??
"Mark, I don't like this."
What is it?! Acid?!
Oh God! Are you blind?!
"Mark? Mark, look.  Well, hello. What's your name?  What- what do you want?"
"Mark, I'm scared!"
"Oh God, Mark! Help!"
You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
"Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?"
"Mark, are we doing the right thing?"
I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
"Hey, I think you'd make a great father."
My God! Mark!  What is it??
"The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here."
Na-a-ah!
Mark!
"Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?"
But what about before that?
Yes!!
"Mark, I'm scared."
"Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place."
Oh no. NO!  Aaaah!
"Uh, uh..."
Mmrrhhhh!
Rrrmm-mmrrhh!
"Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word."
Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
"Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow!"
"Hey, kids."
And I got my tubes tied.
"Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!"
You made a goofy face!
"...Don't you make that face at me, young man!"
Stop it!
"Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week!"
Hello Token. How was school today?
"Why, sweetie? What's the matter?"
J mart?
Hmmm...
He must be parkiing someone else's car.
"Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel?"
"What, what brand are they?"
"Oh, you!"
"Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days."
"Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?"
"Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to."
"Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me."
"No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector?"
"Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say?"
"Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?"
"Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?"
A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.
Wait a minute. What was the movie called?
Oh my God...
"Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?"
To the gym?
Gaah!
...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!
Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint.
Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!
Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint.
I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean. New.
Must clean Butters.  Clean. Never be clean. Must...  kill? The only way? Must kill Butters.  Paaiint.
"Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now."
"No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think."
"Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?"
"And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best."
"If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert."
"I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened."
"Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon."
"""Dear bastard husband,"" No.  ""Dear lying sonofabitch,"" No.  ""Dear assface,"" Yeah, that's it. ""I will no longer-"""
"Stay away from me, bastard!"
You don't know anything!
"Then why, Chris, why?!"
"Well,  you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore!"
"There is no going back, Chris!"
No!  Our son is dead!
"I killed him.  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!"
"I WASN'T THINKING!  I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you!  Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss-"
Just go away and let me die!
"I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now!"
"No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us."
Puerto Rican.
"He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me."
"Yes, I... remember hearing something about that."
Thank goodness.
Oh. Sure.
I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!
Don't forget: your lies started all this.
"Butters?? Oh, Butters!"
"Oh, my baby's back!"
"Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home."
"Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!"
"You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!"
You sure are.
"No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive."
We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
"And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im."
We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
Butters? Butters?!
This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!
"Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!"
"Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!"
"OH YOU JUST WAIT until I get home MISTER!
Cartman:
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank.  Eh."
"YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TROUBLE YOU'RE IN MISTER! ""(Punch)"""
"Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!"
"Friends, by default."
"Oh, Chris."
No! No!
"Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!"
"Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!"
"Butters, time for bed."
"Good morning, Butters."
"No,  I didn't hear about that."
"Butters, a note for you was left on the front door."
Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS
Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!
There's no way my son's going.
Let's all be atheists!
"Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?"
Score one for us atheists
"Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?"
"No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs."
Ohh Godd!!
Butters?  Butters!
Is that bad?
"Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America."
"Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily?"
"Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine."
"Oh my God, our house!"
"Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault."
We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.
"We're sorry, baby."
"What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!"
"Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!"
"Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best."
And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.
I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.
What?
"I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband."
You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!
"That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to."
Oh Butters!
"What are you spending all that money on, Butters?"
"You... have a girlfriend, Butters?"
"Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?"
"All right, you win."
"Stephen, what is this place?"
This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.
"Little girl, you shouldn't be working here."
"No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer."
"... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you."
"Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips."
Hi Butters.
"Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?"
"Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week."
Butters!
"Butters, you have some visitors."
Butters?  Butters?!
"Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy."
"I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go."
"Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie."
"Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot."
"Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon."
"Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?"
"That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?"
"Aw, that's just adorable."
"Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great."
"Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along."
"Excuse me, I didn't catch that."
"Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited."
"Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged: you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!"
"You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play."
Why not?
What on earth is the matter with him?
I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs.
"Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him."
What's that?
If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help??
"Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton?  You are grounded, mister!"
"Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age!"
"Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us?"
With you where?
How much? For Butters?
"Chris, is she serious?"
We aren't honestly considering this?
But he's our son!
The rest of the f- you do mean us?
"Bye, sweetie, we love you!"
A what?
"Steven, what do we do?"
I'm your engineer.
"I have to do it, Steven."
"Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy."
Online
It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.
"We made it, We made it!"
We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!
What?
"Butters, what on earth are you doing??"
Dead people?
"Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor."
"What do you think, Doctor?"
Oh no.  NO!
"Goodnight, baby."
What?!
"Oh my God, Butters!"
"He, h-he's coming down! Oh thank God!"
OHHHH MY GOD!!
NOOOOO!! NOOOOO!! My son is DEAD!! NOOOO!!
NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS!  Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!
Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead?
"Stephen, you did what??"
You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?
"Not like this!  Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn!"
Keep the door locked.
Oh God...  No!
It isn't right! Make it go away!
He was supposed to stay dead!
It's... hungry.
Yes. The basement.
What are we becoming?!
