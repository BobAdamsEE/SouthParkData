Example 1: Randy has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
Its angle is 32 degrees. Its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter. His balls are seven centimeters from the base.
"Randy notes that the drift of his penis is four centimeters to penis right, and its dead weight is .5 kilograms."
Wow. What is that?
He's cool.
