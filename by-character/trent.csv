Say Uncle!!!!!!
What do you shitheads want?!
Sure! I burn lots stuff.
Do you fuckheads even know how to put out a fire?
"All right, fine."
Put it out!
They said they could put it out!
Tell them it was an accident: you thought you could put it out.
"Butters, you saw! Tell them what happened!"
You'd better pray I never get out of Juvenile Hall! You'd better all pray!
I gots some business to take care of.
"Five years. It's been five long, miserable years."
"Can you give me back my time?! Huh?! Can you do that?! Kindergarten, first grade, second?! Can you give me that?!"
I'm gonna give you something you didn't give me: a five-second head-start.
Four seconds!
Three seconds!
Can Kyle come out and play?
"Thank you, ma'am."
I've been lookin' for you!  Five years I've been waitin' for this day.
"You had five years to do that. And while I wasted away my time in prison you've been enjoying nice, normal lives!"
Don't tell me that! I heard about the things you've done! But there were no magical Christmas adventures or talking poo for me! I DIDN'T GET TO FIGHT A HUGE MECHANIC BARBERA STALKER!! NO ACCIDENTAL TRIPS TO AFGANASTAN FOR TRENT BOYETT!!
"Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with."
You don't even know how to use that!  Wow!
No! They did it!
No! You've gotta listen to me!
