I took the job to try and make Canada's health care system better. What could that have to do with my wife?
"Thanks, guy."
...Have you ever had someone you love queef in your face? 
"I'm sorry, I'm calling everyone in the Canadian health care system to find out if they're pleased with their health care. Is this  Ike Broflovski?"
"Your brother receives his medication from us, so we just wanna be sure he's satisfied with the service."
"Before this meeting continues, I should have you be aware that my face has tested positive for queefie sores."
People all over the world get their medication from Canada.
That's impossible! The Canadian health care system is completely integrated and streamlined with IntelliLink. 
"Sure, no problem.  Now, what is your brother's Canadian Medicare's smartname?"
"""strangetamer""  Uh, yeP, there it is.  Ahh yes, here we go. I see your little brother has a constipation problem and has been taking a daily laxative since last May.  Ah, yes, I'm afraid IntelliLink mixed that up and your brother has been receiving large doses of hormones that were supposed to go to an athlete in the northeast."
"Yes, that's right."
"It's fine!  It works fine! Just give it some time!  God, you sound like my wife!  My... my wife."
And... that's why she queefed in my face.
It was a mistake.
"Trying to reform Canada's health care system and being too stubborn to admit that it wasn't working. And even when my wife said the system was too complicated, I wouldn't listen."
"I deserved it. Anyone who thinks streamlining health care into an integreated health care system would go smoothly deserves a giant queef in their face. Thank you, my lady."
"Yes, I've upgraded to the Gold package. Within no time, Canadians everywhere will be getting their correct medications, and going back to normal."
