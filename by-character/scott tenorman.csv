"Do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? I spent quite a while in a mental institution, Eric.  A lot of time for me to learn everything about you, so that one day I could take you down. I even learned the name of your father.  Oh, I know you're confused. Who wouldn't be?  You've been lied to by everyone!  Even by your own mother!  Hahahahahahahaha."
I wanted to torment you with your father's identity. But what I found was more shocking than I could have possibly guessed!
"Welcome, everyone, to the final act of my fabulous Chili Carnival!"
"I got them all here for you, Eric! So listen while you got told the truth!"
"Yes, protect... who? Tell him! Mr...  Jimbo!"
"The Denver Broncos.  There was a right tackle, see? Who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom, and everyone here covered it up! To protect the Bronco name!"
"Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos?"
The only Bronco who lived in South Park. He got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named Liane Cartman!
Tell him! You almost did before but you got shot by your brother who was a Bronco fan! Tell him!
You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Now eat your chili!  The Super Best Friends? Oh no!
"I'll be back, Super Best Friends!"
