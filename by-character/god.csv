"What is it, my child?"
"Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival."
"Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me."
"Be ye careful of pride, Jesus."
"I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself."
"Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me.  Be ye not afraid.  Blessed art thou, my children."
"What did you expect me to look like, My son?"
"Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question."
"My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it."
"You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man â€” with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven."
"I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000."
"Yea. Look upon me, and know me."
"Hello, Satan.  It's... been a long time."
What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?
You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?
"Jesus, what the hell happened to you?"
You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.
"No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them.  And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist."
Bingo.
"It was nice to see you again, Satan."
Goodbye.
Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that you're secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here.
It looks like a chemical weapons plant.
"...Alright, just checking."
