Greetings. Welcome to Marklar.
"I am Marklar, leader of the Marklar."
Marklar to you.
We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us.
"Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar."
"Well, there is a lot of room on Marklar. If Marklar here wants to bring his marklar to Marklar, that would be fine. Just take our marklar back to Marklar and bring all the marklar back with you."
