"Marsh, right? We actually kind of know each other. Your wife and mine are friends."
"Gonna go pound some brews, huh?"
"That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats!"
"Alright, Scouts, I am your new Scout Master, Mr. Grazier!  Together we are going to become the best! The sleekest! The most polished Scout troop in all of Colorado! Isn't that right!  When I ask you a question you will answer ""Yes, Scoutmaster!"" Do I make myself clear?!"
"Good! Now, the first activity for this evening will be...  naked pictures  I'm going to take some pictures of each of you naked, in case we need them, for later."
"Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! ""We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!"""
"Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts!"
"Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this meeting with a little puppet show.  Here's a little Scout. He's always prepared. He's always ready. Now, here's a little Scout telling his parents that Mr. Grazier took naked pictures of him. Look what happens.  Oh! No! Aw! Aw! Aw!  Do I make myself clear, Scouts?!"
"Oh, hello parents. Alright, that's all the time we have for tonight, Scouts. We sure had a great time, didn't we?"
"Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside."
