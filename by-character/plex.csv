"Hey Muno, what should we do now?"
"Aaaall right! Who out in the audience has a cool cool trick to show us?  What's your name, little boy?"
"And what is your cool cool trick, Ryan?"
"And what's your name, little boy?"
Do you have a cool trick?
Tame mo what?
"Uhhh, alright. Let's see our friend Ike tame Foofa's strange! "
"Oh, I see. You're actually-  Wait! Oh my God, what are you doing?! No no no!  What are you doing to Foofa?! No!"
"Now you listen here, little boy! It is never okay to take off your clothes and grind on another person!"
Don't do it.
"What you did was very traumatic for Foofa. Isn't that right, Foofa?  Foofa?"
Oh God. What has this little boy done??
Can I talk to you?
Foofa! 
"Foofa, what is this about you going on the MTV Video Awards?"
"Foofa, you don't have to show your strange to get attention."
"Alright, you won't listen to us, but maybe you'll listen to our special guest, Sinéad O'Connor! "
Don't show your strange on TV.
"Your strange is for your husband, not for all the world to see."
