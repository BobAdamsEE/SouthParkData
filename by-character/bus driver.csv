"Alright kids, everyone on the bus."
Everyone on the bus now! We're runnin' late!
"Hello, kids. I see you're discovering the magic of reading."
"I drive the Booktastic bus, where magic begins. You see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. You can take a canoe down the Amazon or go back in time to Camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. Just like magic. The magic of reading."
Go ahead and pick any books you like. Then give in. Give in to the magic.
"Good day, friends. Welcome to the magical world of reading."
"Oohhh, that's a very magical book, full of wondrous--"
"Indeed, you did. How did you know I would strike here?"
You did?! Really?! Then it worked! My whole plan worked absolutely perfectly!
"When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!"
"Yes! Yes, exactly! Don't you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate."
"Oh, no? He who was blind can now see!  I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly."
"You're welcome. And now, my reading friend, you've proven that you are ready for the big time. I give you this hardback copy of Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand."
"Ow, that hurts!"
Heee--!
