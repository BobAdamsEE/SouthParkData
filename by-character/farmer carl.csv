This is the third cow this month. At this rate all of my cattle are gonna die before the winter's through.
People's been saying they've been seeing UFO's around.
"Yeah, and black army CIA helicopters and trucks."
What was that?
"What am I supposed to do, Barbrady? Just stand here and watch my cattle get mutilated one by one?  Hey! My cattle!  You see? There is somethin' funny goin' on!"
