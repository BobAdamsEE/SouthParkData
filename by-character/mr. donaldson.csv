Hello Mrs. Garrison-  Ass. ASS.  I want to help your class better understand this illness.  Piss!
Faking?  You think people with Tourette's are faking?!
"Do you have any idea how horrible that is to say?  Ass! ASS!  We aren't ""faking"", young man. Trust me, nobody wants this illness, ass.  PISS! PIIISS!"
"This is the kind of intolerance you teach at this school, Principal Victoria?!"
"This if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take this ""bully"" to see that Tourette's is very real.  Piiiss."
"Kids, today during therapy class we have a special visitor.  ASS!  I, I wanted him to meet all of you so he could try to understand Tourette's"
You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!
"Piiiss, coming from my aaass!"
"Your mom would not be better off if you were dead, Thomas. Even if people like Kyle here think so."
So then you apologize for what you said before?
"Well, Mr. and Ms. Broflovski, I think your son has learned a lot, and he appears to be honestly remorseful for making fun of people with disabilities.  Piss! PISS!"
"Well, I think the only thing left now is for your son to apologize to his little classmate."
Well I think we can all put this behind us now.  Piiiss out my aaass!
"We are here today to congratulate a brave little boy. Tonight, Eric Cartman will go on television and become the spokesman for Tourette's Syndrome.  Piiiss out my aaass!"
