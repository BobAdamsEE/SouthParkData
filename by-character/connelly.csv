"Boys, we need to talk to you about a matter of national security. Now!"
"Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space."
"Alright, children, we just need to know one thing: Do you know this person?"
Who?
This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures.
"Look, we don't know what that craft is capable of, but the kid is going to have to land it somewhere. God only knows what sadistic backwards Third-World country could get their hands on that ship!"
Who is this person!
Do it again.
Sally Struthers!
I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go.
"I'm warning you, Bill. Sally Struthers is a bit heavy. But don't say anything, because she's pretty sensitive."
"Ah, Ms. Struthers."
Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia.
We need information on one of the Ethiopians. You must tell us everything you know about him.
"Why, yes. It is a chocolate Yum Yum bar, Ms. Struthers , and there are several more where that came from.  Of course, if you don't want to tell us about the Ethiopian boy..."
I'm... glad we can do business.
Here they are!
We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents!
"Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him?"
"Back away from the space craft, children!"
You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government!
I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.
"Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw."
Alright boys. Time to get back to your quarters.
Son of a bitch!
Get 'em!
"Damnit, damnit, damnit!"
"Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel."
"Oh, that won't be a problem, Ms. Struthers. We have... collateral."
Good! Now get them in our tractor beam!
