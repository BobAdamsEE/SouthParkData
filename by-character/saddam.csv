"Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest!"
"You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends into Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super! Let's get started."
"Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me!"
"Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon."
Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?
"Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain."
"Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest."
"Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran."
"Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!"
"Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax!"
"Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs."
"Oh. You didn't? Heeyy, relax!"
I'm from Iraq.
"No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world!"
"Nothing! Relax, brother."
"Oh, really?"
I changed my mind!  Pray that I don't change it any further!
"He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion."
Eh! Who are you?
"Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.  Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours."
Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
"Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it! Look over here! ...All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?"
"No, no, relax there, fella!"
"Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.  You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as New Baghdad! Qoloh Qalah!  You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!  And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem!  Or you will be stabbed in the head!"
Hey!! What the hell is this?!
"Hello, Satan!"
"Did you miss me, buttercup?"
"Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?"
"Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk."
"Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan."
"COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito?  Â¡Me gusta burrito mucho!"
Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!
"Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us.  You can try, but you know we belong together."
"Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break!"
"And you must be Mr. Assface.  Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy.  Here, I brought you a potato."
"Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right?  Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it."
"Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?"
"Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?"
An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!
Uh huh.
Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back.
"Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff.  Satan, that guy is a pussy!"
"Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!"
"For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan."
Here.  I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.
"D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight.  Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!"
"Hello, Satan!"
"What took yo so long, baby?"
"Great! Let's talk!  Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy."
"Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything."
Would you like a drink?
These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.
"Really? So then... What are you doing here?  Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!"
"Here, have another drink."
"Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil!  Ewuh, I'm all greasy."
Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?
Screw him!!
I know how to solve this little problem.
"Die, pussy!"
There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.
"Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!"
I thought I killed you!
"Right, right."
A walk?
Is this some kind of trick?
"Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick.  Okay, let's walk."
"Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?"
"You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy!"
Ah hahaha!
Aggghhh!
"Die, pussy!"
Aagghh!
"Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you!"
There you are!
You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!
"You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me."
"Aw, you little..prick!"
"What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow."
Let me in where?
"What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!"
"Ey, who the hell are you?"
Nooo! N-nooooooooooo!
