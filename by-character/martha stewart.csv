"In the past few days we've all heard of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion, and so making food that can be inserted into the ass is essential.  Now, everyone knows that some foods are simple to shove up the ass - puddings, soups, raisins... this is a nice raisin pudding right here - but we can also still eat our favorite foods. What we're gonna do today is prepare a Thanksgiving turkey for interorecto.  Now, the key to shoving a turkey up your ass is first wrapping it in string, keeping the pointy wings neatly at the side."
"Not right now, I just wanna focus on my turkey,  right now.  Now, we're going to baste the turkey with lubricating gel rather than with juice - this'll help smooth the insertion later on. We still bake at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes a pound.  When it's done we'll get something like this.  So now we're ready to go. Looks delicious. Let's try it out.  Aaaaa-... Yeah, get it up there. Yeah. AAAA. Yeeaahhhh.  Phew. And that is how you eat a turkey.  We'll be right back with more."
