"Brothers and sisters, the time has come for us to be treated with the respect we deserve! We are a strong and diverse group of people, with members like  Woman with Crablike Body,  Incredibly Obese Black Person,  Man with Brains Outside of Head, and  Liza Minnelli. The talk shows have us on and give us little gifts and perks while they make tens of thousands of dollars."
"We told the talk shows our demands, and they laughed! They say they can get plenty of other stupid guests to go on their shows! So we must picket those other guests!"
Who's not gonna picket?
"Now, we will split up into groups and form picket lines. The first group will be led by: Incredibly Obese Black Man."
"...Oh, right. My bad."
What do we want?
When do we want them?
What do we want?
When do we want them?
"Napoleon, you need to understand something: for a union to work all members must be prepared to make sacrifices and stick together."
"We're you family too, Napoleon. We're like you. When we look at you we don't even see the testicles on your chin. We see the testicles in your heart.  What do we want?"
When do we want them?
Now we can go on with our careers!
