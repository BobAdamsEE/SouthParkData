"Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him  but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway.  Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about."
"Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading.  This could be the final stand-off."
"Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended."
The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.
