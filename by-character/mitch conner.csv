"If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut, kid."
Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo.
"You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo."
You catch on quick kid...
"Hurry, get my wig back on!"
Where the hell do you think you're going?
You gonna walk away from 50 mil?
"You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life."
Then I guess I won't tell you about your father.
"Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right?"
"You really still believe that garbage? The people in your town sold you that line. Come on, you've had to have doubted it all along."
"Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return."
"Good to see you Hat. Helluva night, isn't it?"
"The name's Mitch Conner, I flew the same division as you back in Saigon."
So you admit it. There was a cover up.
Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death.  A lot of suffering. Darkness that most people couldn't stand to see.  I tried to sit it out as much as I could.
"No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner."
"And that's that. ""Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam.""  So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher."
Sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.
"Yeah, the old ""Hasn't anything changed?"" speech. Works on white people all the time."
Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart?
"Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!"
"You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid."
You might wanna
"Hey Eric, Eric!"
"Come on, cheer up."
"Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool."
"Shut up Kyle, you dumb Jew.  You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on."
There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.
