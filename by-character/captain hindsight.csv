What's the skinny?
"Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it."
And then you see that building to the left?
"They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to.  Well, looks like my job here is done. Goodbye everyone!"
What seems to be the problem?
Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling?
"It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill!"
"Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke."
Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve!
My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need!
"Please, sit down. What can I do for you?"
Of what?
Go ahead.
"Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened."
Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner!
"Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong!  It's not a blessing, it's a curse."
"Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone."
Get this kid out of here! I have to think!
I can't help anyone right now! Something came up.
Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk?
Look at those photos on the desk.
'Course it's Courtney Love!
"I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening!"
I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-
Don't anybody move!  So you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me!
I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!
Where are the pictures?! Give every copy of the pictures to me NOW!
You got pictures of me having sex with Courtney Love!
Alright enough! What's going on?!
It's not Courtney Love?
No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?!
NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all!
"It doesn't matter.  Even if the pictures are fake. I can't take it anymore.  Do you have any idea what a curse it is to have perfect 20-20 hindsight?  As soon as something bad happens, I immediately know how it could have been avoided. I can't take it anymore!"
"Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?!"
Wha-? What is your power?
Should I really believe I ruined my legacy?  What should I do?
"Seriously, what should I do?"
"Hindsight's a bitch, isn't it?"
Should I get back in the chair? Remove my powers and just go back to being a simple reporter?
