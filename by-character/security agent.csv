"And so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen, the touch pads at the front and rear doors, and break-in monitors on all windows. I'm afraid those are not secure at all."

"Well, many times, houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows."
"We realize that's a lot of money, Mrs. Cartman, but really, how much is feeling secure in your own home worth?"
"Hello folks, we're more than happy to get your homes safe and secure. Now, you're gonna be wanting monitors on all your doors and windows, motion detectors in the living areas, and I would also recommend you all get our newest personal security system to make sure your wives are safe outside the home."
"Doors and windows should be armed and your motion detectors are up and running, just call me whenever you need me back.  Ah! Who are you??"
Hoo!
