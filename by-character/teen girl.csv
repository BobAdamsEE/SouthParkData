"Stan,  for what it's worth, I think you were really brave."
"Hey, all the cool teens are gonna be at the youth center tonight for a dance. I hope you'll come because you're just so... we-hell, you're just so.. well, that's all."
I'm glad you guys came. Do you like our youth center?
"But this time, if he wins, you get your dad to not close our youth center"
"Oh, Tad."
Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract you. With these.
"Thanks a lot, Stan. Now we're gonna be able to keep the youth center."
"Go ahead, Stan. She's everything you ever wanted."
Yeah. Well he really flipped when he saw these.
