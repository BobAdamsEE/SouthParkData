"My guest tonight is Steven McTowelie, author of the acclaimed book, ""A Million LIttle Fibers."" How are you tonight, Steven?"
Your book has helped a lot of people beat addiction. What made you write it?
"What? What's that? Oh ex- oh excuse me, Steven, I understand that we have a special report coming in. Joining us live from Afghanistan, here is Geraldo Rivera."
"We're here, Geraldo. You're live on the show."
My guest tonight is the little boy who took over the Whale Wars reality show and turned it into a big hit. Please welcome Stan Marsh and his crew.
"So Stan, what motivated you, what... inspired you to get out there and make a hit TV show?"
Once you became captain the methods used to stop the Japanese definitely became more aggressive. Was that the key to help boost your ratings?
"Well there are many people who see what you're doing as a positive thing, and of course, many that see problems with it. Joining us now is one of those people and...  You say Stan's methods are unethical."
"But Sid, you saw the show before Stan took it over; you have to admit that it was nothing but incompetent vegan pussies doing absolutely nothing and trying to turn it into drama."
"But their old captain, Paul Watson , was an unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was okay as long as it served his cause."
