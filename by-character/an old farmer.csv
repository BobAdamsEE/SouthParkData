Mr. Stotch. I know what you're thinkin'.
"I came to talk you out of it. You need to... just accept that your son is dead, not try to bring him back."
"I know you're thinkin' of puttin'; him up there, the Indian Burial Ground up that road. You're thinking if you bury his body there, he will come back alive. Sometimes, dead is better."
"It's been done before, what you're thinkin' of. The Nelson boy, back in '85."
"Don't do it Stotch! What comes out of the ground ain't the thing you put in. The Indians knew that. That's why they stopped using it when the ground went sour. I'm just here to talk you out of it.  Don't bury your son's body at the Indian Burial Ground, Stotch! The one that's right up over there, behind Andersons' bar. Sometimes... dead is better."
