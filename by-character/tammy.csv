"Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school?"
TGI Friday's?
"Yeah, okay. But...  Kenny. Listen. Uh, there's somethin' I need to talk to you about. There's a lot of rumors goin' around about me, that I agreed to give a boy a B.J.? Well, it's true.  But it was before you and I were together, and it wasn't my fault!  See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers."
"You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control.  And then Dave Darsky showed up and took me to TGI Friday's,  and it just happened. But it was only for one second, and I had my eyes closed. I know it's terrible. Can you... can you forgive me, Ken?"
"Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome?"
"Oh, my God. It's that tingling again.  I love you!"
"Whoooooo!  Aaah-oww!  You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe!"
"Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!"
Huh?
"They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God!"
It's a dream come true!
What? You think so?
Me neither.
Purity rings?
"Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring."
"No! I don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy, Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken."
Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.
Oh I feel better already!
What say you and me... go to T.G.I. Fridays?
"Well, Black Friday is still a few days away, but it looks like it's already claimed another fatality."
We don't go to work for another hour.
He wants us to side with him?
"That's right, and Niles Lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise."
"Well, the wait is over and Black Friday is finally here."
