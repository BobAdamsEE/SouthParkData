"A woman being raped. This is what our city has been reduced to. When the money goes, the raping starts. Women are helpless... without the Coon."
Let her go!
You aren't raping anyone tonight!
Get out of here! Get to safety!
Another woman saved from rape. But how many more rapists are out there?
"Don't let the city's peacefulness fool you, commissioner! It's too quiet."
There was another rapist in the park tonight.  It's no coincidence. It must be a rapist plot and at stinks to the top.
I think the Mayor might be involved. It's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash.
"No, I'm just over here now.  What do we know about the Mayor's sexual preferences?"
Now I'm back over here.
I'm right here now.
"Yes, I have to go now.  But in the meantime I have something that might interest you.  Make sure all your men get a look at these, detective!"
"Sometimes it seems the more criminals I try to stop, the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars. The city is a dying whore. She calls out to me to save her. And I don't know if I can. But she is still my city.  And I cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are-  Who the hell is that?  Who the hell are you?"
"Aw nonononono, I am the symbol this town needs!  Dude, seriously, you can't do that! Go home! I was, I was doing this first!"
Yeah huh! You heard of the Coon and now you're being a copycat. Is that your name? Copycat?
"Mysterion? That's fucking retarded! You just gave yourself away, Craig! Only you would think of a name that dumb!"
Yeah? Well you cannot know my true identity either.
Well you're wrong! I'm not Eric Cartman and he's not fat! Care to guess again?!
"Oh all right Kyle! Yeah, took me real long to figure it out! Only you, Kyle, would be a buzzkill, and try to steal my thunder! You don't care about stopping crime, you're just doing this... 'cause you hate me, Kyle!"
"No, I'm no- I  I'm sayin' that... Goddammit Stan is that you? It is you, isn't it? Clyde? Clyde, you're not a superhero, I am!"
"NO! Dude, I'm seriously! You're being a copycat! I'll sue you!  Motherfucker!"
"How is it that nobody came to Coonicon 09? This is just, this is fucking ridiculous!"
"Yes, it's fine!"
"What do you mean ""continued""? You don't know who I am!"
"No, I'm not that kid!"
You're a fucking douchebag! Get outta here!
"Dude, seriously? I'm gonna kick the shit out of you if you don't stop!"
"That's what I'm supposed to say! I know it's you, Kyle. Just stop!"
"I had no choice.  I was at the end of my rope.  Sometimes when a superhero needs answers, he has to turn to the wretched underbelly of society."
Come out where I can see you!
"I didn't want to resort to this, but he could have the answers I need."
"Chaos. I need to keep on my toes.  I'm not here to stop you this time, Chaos! I need information."
"I didn't call you to fight, Chaos! I came to see if you know Mysterion's identity."
I'm not on his side!
That's it!
"Agh- Stop it! You, you... butthole! Knock it off!"
Listen to me! I want to... help you... get rid of Mysterion!
"Because Mysterion is trying to  You fucker, that fuckin' hurt!  Because Mysterion is trying to say he's the hero this town needs! But that's my job!"
"Yeah, but he's a fuckin' dick! I want him gone just as much as you do!"
"N- I'm the good guy, Chaos. I don't betray people."
"I didn't like having to work with this scumbag. But I knew Mysterion was out there, plotting his next move."
You guys have your own storage facility?
I'll take a Sprite.
"You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...? Do you, do you still have that ""Who Is The Coon?"" T-shirt I gave you?"
"Why is Cartman crossed out? He, he could be Mysterion."
"Alright, al, alright, alright, look, Chaos. Just set up a video camera. I know how we can put an end to Mysterion once and for all."
"If you don't make good on your threats, Chaos, then what good are your threats?"
"Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos."
"You know, you're a little scrotum-licker dude! Why don't you shut the fuck up?!  Alright Chaos, I'm gonna get the triggers for these things at ACE Hardware. Keep an eye on this stuff!"
Fear not everyone! Coon is here to save the day.
"Don't worry, Mysterion!  The Coon will now help you!"
"That was great teamwork, Mysterion. South Park is safe. Until next time."
"Well, people are obviously so desperate to learn your identity that they'll do anything. Won't be long before the next villain comes along and threatens violence unless you take off your mask."
Don't you think he knows that?! But superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good.
So that the next terrorist can threaten South Park if he doesn't unmask himself?!
I knew it was you! 'Member I even said it before!
"My entire plan worked to perfection.  My work here is done.  With Mysterion out of the way the Coon can finally go back to keeping the city safe.  Once again, I alone am the symbol this town can stand behind.  Every town needs a hero.  Every town needs... a Coon."
