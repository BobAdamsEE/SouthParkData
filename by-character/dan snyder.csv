My name is Dan Snyder. I'm the president and owner of the Washington Redskins
"Thank you, but I will stand."
"Young man, we ask that you please stop using the name Washington Redskins for your organization."
"Because we are the Washington Redskins, and we are a football team! You have NO right to use our name to get attention!"
"Look! Don't you see that when you call your organization ""The Washington Redskins"", its offensive to us?"
"We are a proud team, Mr. Cartman! We have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing!"
"Uh, I know I can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency?"
"Is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to ISIS. You have to do something, Commissioner Goodell! What are you going to do about this?!"
What?!
That's the most ridiculous nothing answer I've ever heard! What are you gonna do now?!
Ugh! This thing is broken!
Get all the NFL owners on Skype! This thing is broken again!
And so I call upon the help of all owners. You cannot let my people be belittled like this!
The stupid thing isn't working!
"Look, my team is starting to lose hope. You have to use your influence to make these people change their name."
And so I'm alone? What if they ridicule the 49ers team next? Or make fun of Jerry Jones because his eyes are too far apart?
Uh I guess we can live with that.
Thank God!
"Caw-CAW, Caw-CAW.  HooHOO, hoohooHOO."
"No. No, we cannot give up! We have been through too much together. We have fought Eagle, and Bear! The Eagles only beat us by three points."
Don't let them break you! Don't let them win!
Hut! Hut Hut Hut!  Hut hut hut. Hut Hut Hut Hut!  Hut. Hut hut hut. Hut Hut!
Hut hut. Hut!
