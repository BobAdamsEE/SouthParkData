Pehpew Pehpew!
"Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill!"
Okay.
...Yeah.
"...Like, you die."
"Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead."
You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!
He's dead for sure.
Oh my God...
Butters ButterButterBUTTERS!  We have to get out of here!
"Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail!"
"Come on, we have to leave!!"
"Captain, we have an incoming FaceTime request from Eric Cartman."
Cheap XBox Ones? For real?
I like math.
What are you? A sourpuss?
Neato.
How should I know?
Which Angel am I again?
Air shaft.
I wanna be a reporter someday.
Do you think someday I can be a reporter?
See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
"This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party.  As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us.  Anything else?"
"Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news."
"Hey, I'm a real reporter."
"Wow, you mean that?"
I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!
Hey Butters.
I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.
"I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you."
Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.
"I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing."
"Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?"
General Disarray.
It's on all the way.
"Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?"
What do we do now?
"What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?"
Professor Chaos!
I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.
What dastardly deed are we doing now?
Oh.
"Oh, awesome!"
Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons.
They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.
So how do we build it?
No.
What?
"Oh, uh..."
"You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out."
...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode 204.
Simpsons did it!
Simpsons did it!
Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
"Episode 9F17 entitled ""So It's Come To This!"""
...Simpsons did it.
"No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that."
"Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!"
Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
"Don't have a cow, man."
Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!!
