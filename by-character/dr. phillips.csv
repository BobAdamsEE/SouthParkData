"The ghosts of these celebrities are at deep unrest. I've never sensed anything like it.  I believe these celebrity ghosts are still roamin' the world, reachin' out through the child because they are lost in purgatory."
"Sometimes when people die, they can't quite accept what has happened to them. And so before they reach the afterlife, they go to a place called ""purgatory."" It is a temporary plane of existence. It's neither heaven, nor hell. Purgatory is like... being on an airplane that's waiting to take off, but you're still sitting at the gate. And even though the plane isn't taking off, they won't let you back off the plane. And you can't get up to go to the bathroom, because you're on an active runway. All these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on, but for whatever reason, they are stuck without any information, even from the pilot, how much longer it's going to be, and it's taking forever. And they aren't serving any drinks yet. It's like, a terrifying limbo."
"I am speakin to the celebrities that are hauntin' this child. If any spirit can hear my voice, make your presence known."
To which celebrity am I addressin' now?
All you celebrities need to know that you have passed on.
"Boys, quickly! Convince Michael Jackson that he's dead."
He's in denial. He's been in denial all his life. Now tell him or you're gonna lose your little brother.
He's in too much denial!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
