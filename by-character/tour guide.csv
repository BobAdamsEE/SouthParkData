"Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds. Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in Colorado.  Before we get started I do understand we have a special guest in our group today: the ex vice president, Mr. Al Gore.  Mr. Gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here. Now, once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules: stay on the path and do not touch anything. Aright, are we ready?"
Let's go cavin'.
Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.
"Ahh, no.  Now, as you can see, the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Water drips from the cave's..."
"These rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name. For instance, this one here we named ""The Hanging Mushroom.""  And over here we have ""Man With Helmet and Two Bowling Balls.""  And finally, of course, the ""Two Sisters.""  Now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees."
Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?
"All right, everyone, if you'll step this way, you'll see how the cave gets its name."
"In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually blows through, causing a sound you can hear."
"O-kay, everyone, out of the cave. Now!  Go! Go! Go out, now!"
"Ih it's a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure. Here, see?"
"Oh Jesus, here we go again."
"Our factory works 24-7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. Here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk."
And here is where all the fudge is put into boxes to be shipped all over the world.
Welcome to the Museum of Tolerance. Here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in America.
"Now, did you know that words we use can show intolerance?  Let's begin our tour with a walk through our Tunnel of Prejudice, to show you what it can feel like to be discriminated against."
Now you know how it feels.
"We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes. These wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labeled minorities.  Here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts the African-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here?"
"That's right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don't we, kids?"
"That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like ""All Asians are good at math"" is harmful to society."
"Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed."
"This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays , because you see, being tolerant you must also respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight,  like this young man here."
"You other boys have probably called this young man names like ""tubby,"" or ""lardbutt,"" or ""fat tits,""..."
"But you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice."
And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.
"Well, that's the end of our tour."
We have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do.  Hey! What the hell are you doing?
There's no smoking in the museum!
"Get out of here, you filthy smoker!"
"Well, have a great day, everybody."
Tonight we are here to honor an amazing fourth grade teacher with the Courageous Teacher award.  Herbert Garrison came out about two years ago. Since then he has faced adversity. He has even faced ridicule by some of the students.
It is my honor to present the Courageous Teacher award to... Herbert Garrison.
