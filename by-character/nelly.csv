"Ow! What'dja do that for?!  Hey, what's your problem, asshole?!"
Give that back you dirty buttholes!
Gross!
"Oh, my baby come home!"
"Lord, I thought you wasn't comin' till nine."
"So nice to have you here, Liane."
"Oh Lord, and I just put the roast in the oven, too.  Ain't gonna have no time now to baste it. Don't nobody blame me, a woman can't bake no roast and do everything else at the same time.  Can't say that the roast is gonna be terrible, maybe just a little dry.  But I suppose we can make some extra gravy to take the dryness out later."
Na kamaa karash meh nah-
Come out now. Come out now.
You all come out of there now.
"Come on out, spirit. Go!"
"Oooo, that's the potatoes."
"Oh Lord, they didn't bring a victim child."
We weren't gonna ask you where you got it from.
"Lord, Thomas, don't let it get on the curtains."
"I'll open a window, you try to chase it out, Thomas."
"Here, spirit, come out the window.  I'll give you tree-fiddy."
I'm just tryin' to persuade it.
"It's headin' for the kitchen! Aw, Thomas, the pot roast!"
Don't let it get in the roast!
Well I'll wrap it up with some plastic wrap so you can take it home with ya. Should last a few months in the freezer.
This child is clean.
