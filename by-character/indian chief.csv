"Now it is OUR time! We shall attack Plymouth, and we will take... ALL THEIR STUFFING!"
The stuffing mines were never yours!
You are in no position to declare war! Your lead commander is nowhere to be found!
Word travels fast in our sector.
Then the Thanksgiving treaty will be off!
The stuffing mines are ours!
Take ALL their stuffing!
