"Hey, dudes!"
I feel awesome!
"You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I'm totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I'd say I'm  a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy!  Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle."
"No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works."
"God-damnit, all I got was a little golf clap!"
This is ridiculous!
Lunchtime! I'm starved!
That's me.
"Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy."
Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you.
Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut.
"I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids!"
Twenty.
Fine! Then I shall bid you good day!
This is so juvenile.
"Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home?"
"You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame."
Uh oh.
