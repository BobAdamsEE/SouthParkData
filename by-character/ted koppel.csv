"A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCollough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCollough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?"
"Well, Hat McCollough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free?"
"Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as ""positive"" about toddler murder?"
"Yes... It is easy.  Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status?"
"Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because joining us now are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas."
"Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response?"
How so?
