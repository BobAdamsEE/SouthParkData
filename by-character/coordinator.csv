School?
What school are you from?
"Ssss, alright. South Park school, you go over there next to the kids from New York.  Nono, don't put the Florida kids in the building!"
"I need everyone's attention, please! We will now all be moving in an orderly fashion to our assigned hotels. Please follow your group leader to check in."
"Alright, everyone, quiet please! There are over 4 million of you, so we must have quiet! At this time I would like to introduce the woman who is making this all possible, Yoko Ono!"
"You heard her, We'll start the rehearsal in a few minutes."
"Okay, children. We need to play closer attention to the sheet music. Remember, if you get lost, just follow along with Mr. Kenny G here."
"What's this??  ""Revised Music for Tomorrow""?? Chip, did you get revised music for tomorrow??"
Ms. Ono has made revisions again! We've got to get these copied 4 million times and make the revisions to the projected music! Come on! Hurry!
