"Very well. Come, local boy.  Show us how to play your mountain games."
"Yes, yes, we have one of those, too. In fact, we have seven of them, I believe."
Sometimes children must be very firm with their daddies.
Like when Daddy doesn't want to act in a movie because he thinks the script is bad.
"""Twenty million is still twelve million after taxes, Daddy!"""
"""I'd do the picture, Daddy!"""
"""Daddy, please!"""
And so Daddy does the picture.
"Token, these are Oprah's newly-adopted children, Dominique and Zizi."
"Ah, and these are Puff Daddy's kids: P Diddy Mini, P Poofy Bite-size, and Poppa Diddy Diddy Puff Fun-size."
"Yes, come Token. We're all going to head down to the mall and buy some of the stores."
"Now Token, polo is very simple. You simply must hit the williard into some cilium with your fracaman."
"""Can't we play without the uniforms?"" Yes, um. Lert's eat caviar without Bellini's as well!  Now come, Token, and remember: it doesn't matter who wins. It matters who wins three times in a row. Tally ho!"
"You see, you must pay attention, Token. I was able to jollyrow your davishmere with a forecastle."
"Yes, Token, if you want to play such savage games, I suggest you go live with lions."
