Honh honh honnnh! Welcome to French Canada.
Well first you must answer that phone.  Ring-ring. Ring-ring.
You cannot pass through French Canada unless you take zat phone call!  Ring-ring. Ring-ring.
"Allo. If you are going to see za new Prime Minister, then I want to go with you. He has passed a new law forbidding us French Canadians to drink wine."
Honh honnnh! Very good! Let us make haste!
Is a bullshit Canada
I think you'd understand. ...You understand.
It reminds me of death and fear.
Oh no. It's Scott.
"Well, come with us! Maybe you can ask him to take his sodomy ban away."
"Of course. Ottawa left, Newfoundland right!"
"Ah yes, let's wish ourselves there."
Ze Prime Minister is inside.
"Oh well, zo much for zat."
And we won't get our wine.
"Zat explains everything! Za new Prime Minister was Saddam Hussein, once again trying to take over our beloved Canada like he did before."
And we can drink our wine.
