Let me see the stone.
I've seen this before. Stones that were used by the Knights of Standards and Practices.
A legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay. But... they were just a myth.
"The knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum. Should a curse word ever be let out, they would return. A rune for each word of curse was made, representing each of the eight words that so offended God..."
"Look at this: The writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil Geldon , who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power. Then all the world will be destroyed."
What?
Then we haven't much time. We must go!
