"Hey Steve, how're you doin'?"
"I heard there's a little trouble in uh, Colorado somewhere?"
"Oh my gosh. Yoy know, when I uh... stepped down and left you in charge of the company, Steve uh, I knew there might be some challenges for you."
Uh huh.
"You're right, Steve. Some changes do need to be made.  Do yo know what weakness is, Steve? Weakness is believing that competition is healthy. See, there was a time when XBoxes and PlayStations could both survive in this world, but that time's done. It's all headed to one device that people game on, watch TV on, socialize on. There's only going to be one winner. I can't have you idiots throwing away everything I worked so hard to achieve.  Clean that shit up."
"That's right. We just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their XBoxes at incredible deals on Friday, so we've come to offer swords and battle axes, whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers."
"Yes, but we are limiting it to one per XBox follower,, because of course, the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety."
"Certainly. Uh, Eric, right?"
"Oh I certainly don't wanna step on your toes. Don't worry, I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want."
"Let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors."
It's not over. Looks like I came just in time.
Then let's finish it!  You and me!
Winner take all!
This... is over... Now... you die!  It's over. XBox... wins! 
"Go on, kids.  Go get your XBoxes. "
