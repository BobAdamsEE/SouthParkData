"Prisoner 24601, arriving.  Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500.  Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband.  At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper!"
"You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!"
Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year.  He's a real monster.
Just remember: he'd toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance.  He's the last cell on your left.
"Josh,  were you doing the silly voice for the policeman again?"
"Everything that you had when you were first brought in here will now be returned.  One Crayola eight-pack with crayon sharpener. One pair of plastic round-tipped scissors. One marble, blue. And one  switch-blade knife with ""Kill all betrayers"" written on the blade, black.  Trent! Where are you gonna do?"
