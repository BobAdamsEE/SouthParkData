"Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you."
"First of all, there's a five foot rule. If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. ""Hey,  cutie.""  When you're not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun.  We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins.  Now, when you take a customer's order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. ""Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in."" If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. ""I'll be right back with your order, guys."""
"Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open for business. Good luck.  Go ahead and open for business, Porsche!"
"Hi, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?"
Great.  Be sure to try our Cheddar Poppers. Right this way.
Here you go. Porsche will by right with you.
"Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else."
Why not?
"Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing."
I think his name was...  Leopold... Stotch or something?
A tragedy?
"Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served."
"Stan. Stan, we have a big problem!"
It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle.
He was practicing the six-eight count and slipped on the floor.
