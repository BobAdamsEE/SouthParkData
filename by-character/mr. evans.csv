"Uh uh, have a seat, Mr. Morris."
Uh... S-Sexual Harassment Panda.
"Uhâ€”M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a ""panda"" isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children."
...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go.
That's thirty-two more lawsuits in the past twenty-four hours.
Looks like we'll have to cut all counseling and nutrition programs.
"Holy smokes, you're right!"
Ugh!  P-please! Don't sue us.
"Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go."
"D'uh. I mean, he left."
"Enough, enough!  Look, it's obvious we have a lot of emotional issues and personal demons to face here. During your prison time, you will all be spending one hour a day in therapy here with me. What I want you to do is learn to control those sick, sexual urges you have. Now we're gonna try an exercise: I'm gonna confront you with what you lust after most.  Alright parents, now I, I know this is difficult, but I want you to just look at this child. Just try to suppress your urges to rape him.  Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body."
"Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!"
"I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down!  Look, I know this is very difficult for all of you. Most of you are still in denial about what you've done! To you it seems you've never raped your children at all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu.  Now let's try again.  Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it!"
"Okay, so what are some other things that we can do besides molest our children?"
"Sure, ""see a movie""'s good.  We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else?"
"Uh huh. I'll put ah, ""knitting, sewing.""  Who's got another one?"
"Nonono, we're looking for things to do besides molesting our children."
Fishing's good. Uh huh.
