"Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like ""Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"""
"Oh, really?!"
"Dude, this is gay!"
You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!
"""Conscientious."" May I have the definition, please?"
"""Conscientious."" Could you use it in a sentence, please?"
"""Conscientious."" C O N S C I E N T I O U S."
It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
No. I live right over there.  I've lived there all my life.
Because I'm home-schooled.
My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
Right.
"Oh my goodness, are you two enemies?"
"Strange, friends would call each other names and fight."
Papa?
Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
"But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá."
"I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like."
"Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days."
Hooray!
"Hey, guys. What's up?"
"The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade."
"I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time."
Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.
You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
"Oh, dear."
"Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad."
"Well, they duct-taped me to a bench."
"I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all."
"But I want to go back tomorrow, papá."
"Please, just give me one more day."
Can I sit here with you?
Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
"I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place."
"Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me."
Huh?
"Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?"
Alright.
She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
"Rebecca, what the devil are you doing?"
You're out of control.  You did this to my sister!
You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you!
You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass!
"...I'm not through with you, bitch!"
"Calm down, papá!  Everything is all right.  You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on.  Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá."
"I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things."
"Thanks, gaywad."
"See ya, papá!"
"Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting."
Who is that?
"Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous."
Yeah.
"Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again?"
Hn they want us back.
Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen.
Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this.  Car one to base--  Aghh!
"Relax, Linda, everything's fine.  Ow.  Ow."
"No, uh, it's lemon juice."
"No, it just really, really, really hurts!"
Don't be scared. They're just kids.  Where are your parents?!
"...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out."
Get off me!
What the hell is gong on here?!
"Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!"
The mayor! Good! Finally!
No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
"No phones, either? How do you communicate?"
"Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright?"
I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!
"Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!"
"Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!"
"Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D-  Look, here's the book they've been talking about-  it makes no sense."
It's a boy.  They... killed him.
Oh no!
Uh. The fat kid told us to take it.
"Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up!"
Why are you doing this?
Who?
"Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than-  -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore."
I'll do anything to get to a phone!
"Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?"
"No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone."
"I know, but this will all be over soon."
"Alright, I got the book for you."
"Now, can I please have the cell phone?"
Give him the book back.
Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble!
Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!
What?
"Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!"
"The birth-givers! Your birth-givers.  Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now.  They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much.  Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this!  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will."
"If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word."
Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
"Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some."
Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
"Well, what are you kids gonna do now?"
But... they're... children!
I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!
I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!
Hi!
All right! Let's play!
All right! Go Dave!
Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs?
"That's a great story, Sarah."
All right!
Woohoo! OOWW!
Only the most important person in the world.
I'm a lion.
"We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh."
Let's go.  Our faces are painted.
"Wow, what a great house!"
"Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith."
