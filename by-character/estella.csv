With HIM?  But he's just a commoner!
"...Alright, boy, let us play."
"We're going to play a little game called, ""Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log."""
"Oh, you stupid pathetic boy!"
"Boy, do you still think I'm pretty?"
"And, do you still think I'm insulting?"
"I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus!"
You may kiss me if you like.  Come. Let us walk in the daisy garden.
"Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only one, did you?"
"Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come, let us walk through the rose garden."
"Pip.  My goodness, how you've changed!"
I suppose.  So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance?
"Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith?"
Naturally.
Is it? Why?
"Pip, you must know that I have no heart."
"Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but  you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment."
"Alright, Steve. Just one moment."
That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car.
I should. He's my boyfriend.
"What's the matter, Pip?!"
"It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip.  He's... seventeen and has a car. I'm... I'm... very  I'm  leaving."
"Yes, Mother."
Pip?
It is... what I was raised for.
"I told you, Pip. I have no heart."
Oh my. 'E's very cute.
I don't want to. I don't see the point in this.
I don't want to kill any more of them.
You think so? Let me see it  Maybe I can kill it.
Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over.
"Yes! Yes, my small-testicled love!"
