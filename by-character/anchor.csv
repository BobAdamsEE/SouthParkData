Tonight an incredible story of an unknown child in South Park who has taken to the streets in an effort to fight crime.
But who exactly is... Mysterion?
"Curious crowds in the town of South Park, Colorado.  They've brought binoculars and camera phones trying to get a shot of a mysterious superhero."
"If you have any idea about the true identity of Mysterion, please call the 9 News Hotline."
The clock is ticking and the citizens of South Park are gripped in fear. Two days ago an evil unknown terrorist threatened major consequences if Mysterion  does not reveal his identity.
Since the threat was issued there has been no sign of Mysterion. Where is Mysterion?
"An economic crisis has hit South Park and the nation like never before. Another South Park bank has closed down, leaving thousands of people in debt."
Just how far will the economy fall? We asked economic reporter Dan Banks for his assessment.  We'll have the rest of Dan's interview tonight at 10.
"For the first time in almost a year, the economy in South Park has taken a small, but noticeable upturn.  Stores and shopping malls are open again as newly debt-free people feel safe... to make purchases."

"Shock and disbelief tonight as the German-engineered Funnybot delivered his opening lines at the Hollywood Forum, then opened fire on the audience of eleven hundred, killing nearly all of them. Spectators say the violent attack was unmotivated, irrational, and also, pretty Goddamned funny, solidifying the opinion once agan that Funnybot may be the greatest comedian of all time."

It was just last week a team of scientists found traces of HGH on the Shroud of Turin  , along with several other illegal compounds and painkillers."
Priests and bishops have been working overtime to remove Jesus from the record books and from The Last Supper.
