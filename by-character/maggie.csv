"Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry."
Quitting the force? You?
"Not another word of that kind of talk, Harrison Yates.  Believe me I would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home. But I know you. Framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood. Wiping that rich, smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours. You're a good cop, Harrison Yates. You don't have to question that. Because I'm here to tell you."
Where're you goin'?
