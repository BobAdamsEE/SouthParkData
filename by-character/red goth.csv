I'm so freaking stoked that Cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists.
Do you think the dark lord Cthulhu is gonna make us go to school?
"Good, because if I have to go to PE class again, I was gonna kill myself.  Who the F'n H is that?"
"It means Cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff. It's gonna be like, a Nine Inch Nails concert that goes on forever."
Hardcore goth.
"Whaaat? Dude, I don't wanna kill anybody."
"Ugh, whatevs."
I thought that when Cthulhu rose from the dead all was gonna be darkness and pain. I thought at least school would be canceled.
"Not our god. He promised everything would change if we worshiped him, but we're still sitting here smoking cigarettes like before  It's like Obama all over again."
"Cthulhu isn't alive or dead, alright?"
Luckyyy...
"Hey, get out of here, you fuckin' dork!"
"Yeah, I hope we win."
