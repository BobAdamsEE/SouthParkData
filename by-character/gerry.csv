"Good morning, girls.  Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling."
How did I get such a beautiful wife?
"I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally."
Nobody. L-let's just get you girls to school.
Is it bigger than a bread box?
Why aren't we moving? What's gong on?
Oh my God.
AAAAAH!
"Let's bail!  Everyone get out of the car! Go!  Oh my god RUN!  WAAH! Token. No, Token, we had nothing to do with this. I know you're pissed off, but but be reasonable!"
No! Nonono!  Nooo!
What's up girls? Daddy did it!
