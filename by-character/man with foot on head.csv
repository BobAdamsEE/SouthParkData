Hey Roger!  What the hell is with these horrible veggie platters?!
The talk-show circuit. Don't tell us this is your first one.
"Oh, ah I hate doing the Jenny Jones show. They don't even have their own hair people."
We all know each other and we kinda stick together to make sure our industry is protected
"Yeah, loh-, Lobster Boy used to make appearances on all the talk shows. He was one of the most popular disfigured peoiple on TV."
So you know what we did to him?
"One night all us freaks got together, and we... boiled him alive."
We're glad you agree.
Napoleon?
We've got big news! The union is striking.
Grounded for what?
Why? We're a union and we have a right to picket.
"...Alright, that does it! It's time to bring out the big guns! Prepare the video sabotage!"
Attention Maury viewers
We did it! The strike worked!
Jesus Christ! That out-of-control kid ripped poor Napoleon's balls right off!
