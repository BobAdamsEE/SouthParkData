"You're on thin ice, Rodriguez! Now listen up! The Denver County School Board has sent over a special guest teacher."
This may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez
"Students, I want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores. The school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit.  The test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating."
The test will be tomorrow. Make us proud.
The standardized advanced placement test is considered one of the most difficult and carefully monitored tests in the country. Twenty-four of our students took the test and all twenty-four scored 100%
Sure.
