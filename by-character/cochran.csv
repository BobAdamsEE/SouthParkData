"Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote ""Stinky Britches"" ten years ago. And they make a good case. Hell, I almost felt pity myself. But ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, I have one, final, thing I want you to consider.  Ladies and gentleman, this is Chewbacca.  Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about that. That does not make sense."
"Why would a Wookiee, an 8-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall Ewoks? That does not make sense! But more important, you have to ask yourself: ""What does this have to do with this case?"" Nothing.  Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! It does not make sense! Look at me, I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation... does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests."
"Wait!  Mr. Chef, this music has really touched me. I like to take up your case, free of charge!"
I will.
"We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer."
"Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client, Chef.  I know he seems guilty, but ladies and gentlemen, thisâ€¦ is Chewbacca.  Now think about that for one minute. That does not make sense. Why am I talkin' about Chewbacca when a man's life is on the line?  Why? I tell you why. I don't know. It doesn't make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit!  Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey."
