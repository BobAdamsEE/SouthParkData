"And we will all miss you, Chef,  but we know you must do what your heart tells you.."
"People! People, quiet, please!  We must not panic!"
I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.
"We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!"
"People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton!"
You're a lesbian now?
The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.
"I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then."
"Mrs. Garrison, get out of here."
"All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do?"
"Please, Mr. Valmer."
"Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, ""Fags get out."" Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-"
...'Scuse me?
...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!
"What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!"
You four turd balls in my office NOW!
You have got me in a lot of trouble!
She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!
"Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!"
HOW?!
"Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!  As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cows.  And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!"
Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
You found it! You found the memorial!
"And the cows? Are they all back, too?"
What?!
"Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing."
Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans!
Didn't we ever release them?
"Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell."
"No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them."
"And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! ""The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats"""
You boys win the Halloween Chocolate Ball!
"Oh, what now?!"
The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
Right.
"Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before more people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park."
"Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!"
Exactly!
Mayor.
Why?
"Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park."
Shmuck!
"All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?"
"So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes."
"And so I declare today Randy Marsh Day, where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion. Gentlemen?"
"My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more?"
"Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it."
Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.
"All right, all right. Name your price."
Done. Just find out what's happening.
"Boy, they're really pissed."
"Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me."
And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all.
"This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws."
And I want to assure the nation that is watching that South Park is not a town of prejudice or bigotry.
God no.
This guy's insane.
"Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do you have anything to say before you die?!"
"You mean, Jared's aides are like my aides?"
He's right. It happened!
"People, people, calm down."
"Yes, but standing out here yelling ""Rabble rabble rabble"" isn't going to help anything."
"People, what do you think we need to do?"
"...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city."
"Mr. Lu Kim, tear down this wall!"
These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible?
"Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays!"
"But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us.  Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, there is no Christmas. They have nothing."
"Ahalright, here to light the Christmas Tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of Christmas. Jimmy."
"Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks?"
That's it? That's it! The song's over! We can light the tree!
"Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more seconds until Christmas!"
"And so without further ado, here's the most courageous, most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve."
"Okay, people. What are we rabbling about now?"
"Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have to give the town square to both groups."
"People, I told you, you have to share the stage."
"And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway."
"The Native Americans have purchased the land from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership."
The Native Americans bought the bank.
"Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes."
Three hundred thousand dollars.
"As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help?"
"Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you ""NO!"""
"Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them."
"All right, people, we are all extremely upset over what's happened.  But let's try to speak one at a time."
"As it was in the times of our forefathers, so it is now. Stan Marsh, for not following our most sacred of rites, you are hereby banished from South Park for all eternity. Or until you decide that voting is important. Good-bye, Stan. May the gods treat you more kindly than we did."
"All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B."
"Kid, we're have a city council meeting."
"Kid, what the hell are you talking about?"
"Johnson, get him out of here."
I know. I signed the permit.
"I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little ""festival"" should pump some money into our economy."
They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want!
That kid really needs some psychiatric help.
"All right, let's go."
What have I done?
"All right, people, let's save it!  They still have a long way to go!"
What's happened?
That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!
