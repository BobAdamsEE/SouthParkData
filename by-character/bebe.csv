Eww!
Somebody might have lice?
And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!
Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.
What??
That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
"I'm not...  telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there!"
"Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor."
Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.
"All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing."
Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!
"I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?"
"Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!"
"Did you seeee these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible!"
Right?
"No, it's a little strap."
"If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away!"
"Oh please, you're lying."
"Wait, I, I didn't do anything wrong."
Wow.  Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!
"Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!"
Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?
"Come on Wendy, kick his ass!"
She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!
"And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo."
"As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble."
He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times.
As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.
Hey Bridon.
They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in!
"Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?"
"Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?"
Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
I can't believe they're this upset.
Really?
What?
What?!
Shut up!
Why?!
Token likes Nichole?
Okay.
"Oh, that's okay.  So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you."
Who? Whowhowhowho?
Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.
Bebe!
Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?
Bebe!
All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.
You! HATER!
Bebe!
You suck!
Can we try this without Wendy?
"Yeah! You have a bad self-image, Wendy! You need to go down to the gym and get a better one!"
What are you gonna do?!
This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.
"Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers."
"The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands."
I want a pot-bellied elephant.
I want a Starvin' Marvin.
Our slide!
Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair.
You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!
"That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?"
Really?
"Oh, cool."
Yeah.
I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
Gross!
Did it work?
I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
Pass this up.
"Kyle, could you turn around for a second?  Thank you."
"Come on, Wendy."
"Don't you guys still wanna play ""Truth or Dare""?"
Then come on!
Who wants to go first?
Okay.
Okay.
"Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!"
"Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?  Stan, Truth or Dare?"
"Kyle, can I talk to you?"
"Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart."
I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
"No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way."
"Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.  Okay, Clyde, we can go now."
Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.
Do you think it'll hurt?
"Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow."
"What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?"
I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
Come on! It's time for the fight!
"Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer."
"After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad!"
"Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!"
"Sure, what?"
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?
"Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, ""sexual tension."" Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with."
Kiss him and get it out of your system.
"Are we gonna get paid now, or after?"
We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.
Oh... Okay.
"Okay, so where's our money?"
Let's go ice-skating.
"Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate."
"Water, Helen! Waaa-terr!"
Her feathers are beautiful.
"Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?"
"Water, Helen, Water."
"Helen, Helen. Water, Helen."
"Yes, that's it.  That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!"
She did it!
I've got three.
"Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!"
Do any of you have your condoms on?
"Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS."
Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!
We'll never walk away. Never!
Hey guys.
"You guys uh,  notice anything different?"
"Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away."
"Oh, uh, forty-eight?"
Yeah?
Really?  I've never done that before.
"Why sure, that sounds hellafun."
Cool.
Okay.
"Uh. Listen guys, uh, It's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later."
Hey everybody.
"""My cat Thumper."""
"""Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail."
"""Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."""
Hey guys.
...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?
"Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today.  They called me a slut, with a huge gaping vagina."
"But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool."
"I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family."
"Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, anyways."
Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.
Precious?
Uh huh.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Put the lotion in the basket!
Don't you hurt my fucking dog!
"You guys, calm down!"
This is insane!
"Stop it you guys, please!"
"Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble."
I know. They've been there all day.
"Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?"
"But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters."
Mom?  What's six times eight?
Having boobs sucks.
I wanna have breast-reduction surgery.
Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.
Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?
I think it's insane to want them bigger.
Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.
"Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want."
"No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero."
Damnit!
"Oh, fuck off!"
MOM!! MOM!!
My breasts!
"No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!"
That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!
Hey guys.
Oh cool! It worked!
Yes!
Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.
Wendy breaks up.
Wendy breaks up with you.
She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends.
"Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!"
"God, you're so stupid!"
"Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of."
"If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play  Peter Gabriel."
"I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy?"
Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going!
Is somebody in there?! I'll tell on you!
"Come on, Wendy, we're gonna miss it!"
Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall!
"Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here!"
"Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls,"
"Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous!"
"Thanks, Annie!"
"You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party."
"You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!"
Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!
"Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited."
"Party at my house tonight, Kyle."
Now here's what I'm talking about.  A little midnight blue!
"Hey Kevin, party at my house."
We're being stupid spoiled whores.
"What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!"
"Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!"
Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.
"Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all."
"Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled."
"Okay, okay. My turn, do me now!"
I want to know if I'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future.
Four.
Blue.
Red.
All right!
That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.
"We could play ""girl talk."""
"Yeah, and you're flat!"
She's in the bathroom crying.
"Aw gee, she's really upset."
"Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great."
"Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while."
I've been looking after it all day. I have to go to the hair salon and the candy store!
"Stan, this is our egg. We're both supposed to take care of it."
Well whether you wanted to or not doesn't really matter now! We're going to get graded together! It's your egg too! Own up to your responsibilities!
"Hey Wendy, how's your egg doing?"
"Yeah.  I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around!"
"Oh, goodie."
