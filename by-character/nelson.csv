"Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?"
Is that a computer game?
Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you.
"Oh.  Hi, coach."
"Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying.  Coach, what's it like when you die?"
How come I have to die now?
"I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?"
I'm sorry.
I think so.
"Thanks, coach.  Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer?"
"Well then, will you just... win for me?"
Coach.
"I feel pretty good, except for the cancer.  Coach? Does God hate me?"
Oh. My cancer hurts.
Wow.  At the Pepsi Center?
"That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?"
All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.
No hope. No... hope...
Not anymore I'm not!
My legs. I... I think they're broken.
Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out...
"Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy."
Women love huge balls?
I didn't see the game.
Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
Sure did.
Forty-five minutes non-stop.
"I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome."
Wicked.
It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.
Yes?
"Yeah, that's right."
"Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay?"
I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.
"Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology."
"She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch."
"Sir! Sir, we've found a note!"
