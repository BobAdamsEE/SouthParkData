Hello!
"Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends?"
"I really like your town. My dad wanted to move somewhere to get away from it all. He said he wanted peace and quiet, and to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything."
It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.
Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
We have arcade games inside.
Dad?
"No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games."
He's retired now.
"Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard."
Dad? You out here?
"Guys, this is my dad. Michael Ja-"
Who wants the first cotton candy?
I fell down.
Ow!
Thank you. That already feels better.
I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.
I don't have a mom.
No. I was made in a laboratory.
"My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home."
"No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts."
"Wow, these are great. What are they called again?"
"Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden."
"Hi, Stan."
Dad says it wants to eat us.
We're scared!
Hi guys!
Really? You mean it?
Aaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaah!
Hi guys!
"You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Nooo!
Ah!
Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.
