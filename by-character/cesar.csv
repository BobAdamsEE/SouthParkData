"No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer."
So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?
So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.
"See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him."
"See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you."
Tsst.
"Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation."
Tsst.
"Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant."
Tsst.
"Tsst. See, I'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response."
I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?
"Go on, take your son for a walk."
"See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along."
Tsst.
"Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon."
"Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son."
"Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you."
"Good, Ms. Cartman. Very good!"
It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy.
"Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken."
"I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does."
Tsst.
I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken.
We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.
We need him to become relaxed and submissive.
"Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant."
See?
Tsst.
Tsst.
Tsst.
I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.
"It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle."
Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby.
How is the painting going?
Oh look it came back.
Well let's feed it.
This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
"Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?"
"Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate!"
"You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it."
"You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control."
"See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state."
Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.
"Now you can give him a snack.  Good, this is really good. Now try a command."
"This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now."
Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.
"So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?"
That's greeat!
"Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend."
"Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality."
How is the child doing?
"That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too."
"Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles."
"No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go."
