Mayor! Mayor!
My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.
We're desperate for stories.  A-and this one is so compelling.
Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
"We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins."
"Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family."
Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
"Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you.  I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Misteruhh Garrison."
"Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!"
Thank you! Next!
Next!
Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs!
"God, I hate mountains.  This better not push back our shooting schedule.  Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it.  Who's that?"
"Whoa. Talk about ""all washed-up"", huh? Great to have you, Eric!  Here we go, aaand action."
Bang!!
What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!
God-dammit!  What the hell is this?!
Somebody go see why we lost the hookup!
We're snowed in?
"Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?"
"Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?"
Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?
How can we? How could we live with ourselves?
Aaww.
"What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?"
