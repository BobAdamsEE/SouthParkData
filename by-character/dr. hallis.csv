You?
"Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age."
Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane.
Why do you... hate your breasts so?
"Oh, come on now, that's just silly."
"Oh, awesome. Thank you so much, Jillian. That's great. Oh, God-damn. Thanks you so much."
"Yeah, whatever. Get out of here.  Now, I was saying?"
"Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it?"
"That may be true, but I'm afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl."
"If, on the other hand, you'd like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm?"
"Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts?"
"Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant."
"Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty."
"However, young lady, I'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone.  I'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go."
You pass. Let's do this thing.
Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure.  What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water.
"Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars?"
"Cha!  Gotta!  Jam it!  Up there!  Get!  In!  There!  You!  Bitch!  Get!  In!  There!  You!  Bitch!  Hah!  Okay, there's one, Wendy. Doing great."
