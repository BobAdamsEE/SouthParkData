"That clue led them to a 9-11 conspiracy group party, where they got a lot more clues."
Those clues pointed out that all the 9-11 conspiracy theories could be disproven scientifically. And that's when Frank got his biggest clue.
That all the 9-11 conspiracy Web sites are run by the government. The 9-11 conspiracy... is a government conspiracy.
"For a government to have power, they must appear to have complete control. What better way to make people fear them than to convince them they are capable of the most elaborate plan on earth?"
"Just one thing, Mr. President: How the devil did you know we were all here?"
"And the government was more than willing to take the blame, so long as it made them look responsible for 9-11!"
"Well, it looks like this mystery is solved. It's time for the culprit to finally pay!"
