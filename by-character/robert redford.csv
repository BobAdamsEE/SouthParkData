"My God, she's even more terrifying than I remember."
"Why do we hold the Sundance Film Festival here, Phyllis? It's so painfully crowded."
"No, this used to be a quaint little mountain town. Now look at it. Sushi restaurants, upscale clothes stores, $25 parking, Liam Neeson... I tell you, Phyllis, I think we've tapped this town's resources out. We must move the festival to another small mountain town and begin again."
"This is perfect. Why didn't we think of it sooner? This town still has some charm left, not the mess we turned Park City into."
"Yes. And the town after, and the town after that. Like termites, we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up. And then move on, until every quiet mountain town is like Los Angeles."
"Because we have to live in L.A. And if we can't live in quiet, simple, peaceful mountain towns, then nobody will!  Waitwaitwait. Zoom in to a close-up of my face when I do that. Ready? Then NOBODY will!  That's it."
