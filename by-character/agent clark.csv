Stan Marsh?
I'm Agent Clark  and this is Agent Marx  We'd like to talk to you about your Pinewood Derby car.
"Young man, what we are about to tell you is a matter of national security. Yesterday every country and embassy on Earth was contacted by... an alien life force."
We believe that they intend to welcome us into the Galactic Federation of Planets. They will want to meet the people who discovered warp speed for our species.
"Mr. Marsh, we were just telling your son that thanks to you, we have made first contact with alien life."
