"Okay kids, everyone in the pool!  Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now."
Just jump in.
"It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it."
"There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us."
"Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later."
Just do your side stroke.
"That's doggie-paddle, Eric. Now come over here!"
"Okay.  That's it! That's it, you can do it!"
"Come on, Eric!"
The snake's been destroyed.  The pool's open!
"Alright, Kenny, let's start with some warm-up exercises."
"Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be."
"Well, if you wanna be a real singer, you need to go to a conservatory in Europe. There's no other alternative."
"Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack."
