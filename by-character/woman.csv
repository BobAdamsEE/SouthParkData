Oh my God!
Oh nooo!
"What?  Mr. President, are you sure?"
"Mr. President, we need your final approval code."
"Mr. President, we need final authorization!"
"Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!"
"Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!"
"Five seconds, Mr. President!"
"Mr. President, we need a decision now!"
Air it!
Burn him! Burn the towel!
"Take a picture of the sound, Steven."
They killed him! We can come out!
My monvert's never looked so clean.
We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?
"Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words.  In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself a little person. Who knows what a little person is?  Yes? Over here?"
"Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!"
"Are you okay, hon?"
"Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious."
I'm Allyson.
Dehhhnyihhhs!
"Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby."
Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
Please! Open the door.  They say you are hiding cats.
"You don't understand  My little Nishka,  She has nowhere else to go."
But they will find him.
"Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times."
Eeeek! Eeeeeek!
Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!
A little closer!
Wha?!
Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.
"I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper."
Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!
"Excuse me.  Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too."
"For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn.  and The Resuscitator"
We've gotta do something!
"""Oy my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales."""
I'm a pirate in a war.
Paul!
We don't have a captain!
You motherfucker! I never should have married you!
"Yeah, let's get this party started."
"Everything all right, Fred?"
Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?
What are you going to do to us??
You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??
"I just clicked ""Agree."" I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!"
"Uh, what are you going to do to us??"
What??
(Aaaaaah!)
"No, please!"
"Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse."
Oh my God look out it's a Mexican!
"Guest room. Guest room. Bed, bed. Pillow. You're going to be okay.  Do you understand?"
What are we supposed to do?! Call the police?! And have him shipped back to Mexico like some animal?!  Window. Window.
"Bueno!  He'll have so much more opportunity here than he ever would in Mexico!  Window. Window.  Windex. Windex, Mantequilla. Paper towel.  Sí, sí Mantequilla"
"Oh darling, it's wonderful."
"Mantequiila? Mantequilla, come to the living room. We have a surprise for you."
"It's a present, Mantequilla. Un presente."
Oh he's such a happy little Mexican.
"Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy."
Oh he's so adorable.
"It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the dishes, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said ""I need to go home."" I tried telling him ""your home is here, Mantequilla! ¡Tu casa es aquí!"" But I don't think he feels it."
"No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!"
No! Mantequilla bad! Go now!
"No es bueno, Mantequilla! ¡No me mi-mires! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor no mires!"
Oh my God.
Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!
No! I love you! I love you back!
Does that little boy have a gun?
But-
"Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them?"
Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.
"Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on."
Do you kids like magic?
"Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randi!"
"Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready."
Decks??
"I'm so confused, babe."
Please! Don't take me away from my child!
Oh my Gooodd!
Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.
Ooooh.
"Oohh, they're so beautiful."
"Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer."
Hallelujah!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH
"Oh my God, did he...?"
"Oh my Goooood, help meeee!"
"My God, that's disgusting!"
"Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can."
"Take that, you asshole!  What the fuck was that?"
"This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture."
"Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?"
"Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A."
I'll take two.
..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!
AAAAAH!
Can I help you?
Husband? You're not my husband.
"I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass."
Oh.
"It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about."
"Yes, Lorry."
"Uhlarry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on."
"We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace."
"Leslie, I'm with Buck now."
"Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together.  Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry."
I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire.
Am I going to spontaneously combust?
This is very scary.
"Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
"Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
It's out of control.
Oh! What darling little children.
"That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers.  But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec."
"Richard, this is Grandma."
"Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope."
Bonjour.
Oui.
"Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools."
"I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously."
"You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment.  At all."
Oh my God!
The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.
"We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!"
"We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again."
"Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus.  Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely?  No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them.  Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19.  Come on, remember : reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food.  Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin?"
Hello-o.
Let's flip it over!
"Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?"
That's right!
"This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!"
"Look, I can see him."
Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!
How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!
"Oh, you people make me sick!"
"Cartman, I want youuu!"
Nothing. Why?
"Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?"
"I don't know, uh. I guess nothing."
"Oh, huhuh."
"Eh, heheheheheheh."
"Oh, huhuh."
What's happening??
"...Because now, every time I look at you , I see her!  I have to move on."
"Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are."
There has to be a town around here somewhere.
"Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads."
What's the matter with it?
"Oh, look! There's a town up ahead.  Smiley Town? That's a strange name."
Hello? Is anybody here?
Yes.
Why not?!
"Ew, I almost stepped in it."
Whoa
"Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!"
Oooh.
"Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil.  Kevin, is that you?"
Hello?  WAAH!  Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod!
"Here you go, Robby."
"Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin."
"Oh, I don't know."
"I don't wanna die,  I DON'T WANNA DIE!"
"Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh."
Can I help you?
Your... mom told you?
"We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children."
Frances Velman.
"Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce.  One donor, certified, on record."
We don't care about that.
Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
But we have to free Hat.
"Hey, he's got a point there."
Or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?
"Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it!"
"...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm..."
"Jesus, mio bambino no puoi sentirsi."
"Bene, Benedicali!  La morte rossa!"
"Runs with Premise, come quickly!"
"It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick."
"He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!"
"Well, how do you know he didn't?"
The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?
Thank you very much.
Paul. Paul!
"Wow, that's a really neat little robot you have there, little boy."
Yes?
"Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?"
How about fifteen dollars?
"Oh goodness, what happened?"
"Oooh, no, come on inside.  Wait right here, I'll be right back."
I can't believe these bargains.
"Huh, I never."
"Chris, will you sit down?"
What is that kid doing?
Who is that lady?
Well what about lesbians?!
"Hello, would you like to take a personality test? It's fun and it's free."
We're doing free personality tests today.
"Have you heard of Scientology? It's all based on the book, Dianetics. A lot of really cool people are Scientologist's, like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Why don't you come on in and we'll get your fun free personality test started.  Let's just find an empty room here, lots of people getting free tests today.  Hey Brian."
"The boy is from a small mountain town in Colorado, sir."
What?
