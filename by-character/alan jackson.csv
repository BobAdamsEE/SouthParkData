"Where were you when they built the ladder to heaven? 
Did it make you feel like cryin', or did you think it was kind of gay?"
"Well I, for one, believe in the ladder to heaven.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. 9-11
I said 9-11, 9-11, 9-11, Ni-hi, hi-hine___
Eleven.
Thank you! I have a new CD out with all my 9-11 songs for sale right here!"
Where were you when they ran out of stuff to build the ladder to heaven?
Where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven?
"Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, you couldn't really get there?  You little bastards ruined my latest song!"
