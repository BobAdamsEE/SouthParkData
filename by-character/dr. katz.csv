"Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think… Mr. Hat… went?"
"Well… I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah."
Um... Ahem...  Are you gay?
It-it's j-just-- It's just a question.
No.
"Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you."
Mr. Hat was gay?
I see.
That I did not need to know.
"Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet.  What do you think about that?"
