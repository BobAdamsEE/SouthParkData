"Doesn't work that way.  Now, Kenny is telling me that... you're his best friends, and he's in a ss-safe place."
"Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle?"
"Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma?"
"She says there was something she asked you to do, and you're not doing it? She wants you to look for four white doves."

But I'm a psychic.
I'm not a douche! What if I really believe that dead people talk to me?
"I think I've had of your bullying me! Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs, lock myself in my panic room and call the police!"
"I'm not talking to your friend and I'm not a douche!  You'd better get out of my house, 'cause I'm gonna call the police!"
"So, you think you can talk to dead people better than me, huh?!"
"They told me your show is getting better ratings than mine, that you're saying I'm a fraud on your show! You'd better not ever call me a liar, or a fake, or a douche again, or else I'll sue you for slander!"
Everything I tell people is positive and gives them hope! How does that make me a douche?!
I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to the world that I'm psychic and you're not!

"Thank you.  Alright, asshole! I know you're here to try to throw me off, so go ahead. Give my your best shot!"
Wah-why?
But I do have a special power! I know I do!
"God-damnit, I'm special!!"
Why that... that's me!
"Well, thank you very much!"
What?!
"No, wait! I'm not a douche! I make people feel good about themselves!  I give people resolution!"
