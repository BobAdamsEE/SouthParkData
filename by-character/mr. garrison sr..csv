"Oh, hello, son."
"Ub. Sure, of course.  Your mom's out at Bridge Night. You want a beer or somethin'?"
"Uh, what?"
"Uh, okay, like what?"
What??
What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you!
WHAT??
"Oh, my God!"
"Well, NO!!"
"Uh, what's goin' on?"
Ah-I didn't! You knew I didn't!
"Thuh, that's me."
What can I do for ya?
"Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger!"
No! He's upset because I didn't molest him!
"A little, yeah! He thinks if I don't molest him it means I don't love him."
I didn't do it because it's wrong!
Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year old son?!
"Well, I won't have sex with him!"
Am I the only sane person left on earth?!
Good night.
Uh huh.
Should be fine.
Won't be necessary.
I'm not going to molest you!
God-damnit!
"Well, I'm having some troubles at home."
"All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right?"
"Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question?"
Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life?
"No no wait, uh, you don't understand."
"Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son."
"Uh, he doesn't have a gun."
No! Nobody's got a gun!
"Well, I just hope that NOW we can put the past behind us and, and try to be a normal family again."
"I didn't do squat!  Here you go, a hundred bucks."
