"Pray, come in!"
"As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth.  This is my little room - rather musty, and this is your bedroom."
"Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them!  I'm quite ashamed!"
"Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!"
"That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad!"
"Well, don't you know about Ms. Havisham's melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come!  Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havisham."
"You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havisham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat.  And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth."
"Not at all, I'm sure.  Anyway, Ms. Havisham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip , to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler."
"Not at all, I'm sure.  So this man pursued Ms. Havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her. She passionately loved him back. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came. But not the groom.  And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table!"
"Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding."
"But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table."
"Not at all, I'm sure!"
"Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours."
"I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman, who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex."
Righto. Pip. Righto.
"Dear God, Pip, look!"
"Righto, Pip."
"Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havisham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid."
"Yes, but just think about... panda bears!  Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda bears are.  What silly little noses they have!"
"Oh, right, right, let's not think about panda bears, then. Let's think about ...swimming! Oh, what jolly fun swimming is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive."
"Oh what fun it is to collect stamps! Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors."
"Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about..."
Oh what fun ice-skating is!  Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me.
"Please, sirs, you must not cry!"
"Philip, it's too late!!"
"Ooooo, top smart, Pip!"
"Oh, I'm so glad everything has worked out.  Where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then, Pip?"
