Hello?
From what? Who is this?
Are you serious?
Like what?
Oh jeez.
"Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!"
"Come on, time to go home."
"Ey, put down my car!"
"No! No! Hey, stop it!"
What's going on back there?
Freeze!
"Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal."
"Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez."
"Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself."
"And that's when I masturbated to Game of Thrones. I know it was wrong to masturbate, and I know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty."
But I am done forever with Game of Thrones. Forever
Thank you. 
"I, I feel really good."
"Whoa, this is a good movie!"
"Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too."
Wooo!
The short what?
That's not how I played it!
It's almost midnight.
"Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?"
"Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong."
"There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no podunk little town!"
Goddammit!
"Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here.  What's the trouble? Where's the body?"
Uhhhh... oh.
"Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see.  Did you get a good look at the suspect?"
"Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?"
"Haw, camel poo."
"Give me that!  That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!"
"Uhh... It says, uuh, ""Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye."" Well, there you have it. Case closed."
"I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people."
How about fishing without a license?
"Whataya call this then?  If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you  by gunshot to the head.  That's right, return to your simple lives.  Just forget this ever happened. Forget.  For-get."
"Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers."
What's that?
"I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?"
Hmmm.  I can't go on living this lie!
"Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established."
"Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet."
"All right, all right! I can't read!  There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire!"
I need to go poopies.
"Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?"
Ahhh... O... O--
Ahhh... O...
Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?
Haa haa. Ha ha ha.
"I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: ""Big... dog..., little... dog.  A red dog... on a..."" Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life."
Hooray!
"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
""Whoosh!"" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes"
"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go..."
"Oooh, pretty good."
"Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover."
Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?
"Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's."
I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
"Oh boy, I'm in big trouble.  I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos."
"Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis."
"You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset."
"Sure, nightsticks for everybody!  You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case."
"Now, what did that clue say again?"
"To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!"
We need a copy of Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft right away!
"Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake!"
"It says, ""Mmmuh mmmuuh..."" Uh, what's this word?"
"Oh, yeah. ""I... mmuh mmuh--"""
"That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!"
"Oh, weak, dude! We're too late!"
"Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue."
"""Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist.""  I read it! I read it all by myself!"
"""Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..."" Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!"
"Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo."
"It is, too!"
"""Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"""
"""Pet--"" Wait a minute."
"Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!"
"Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute."
"Oh, no!  Shhh!  Keep your eyes peeled."
Grab him!
"I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!"
Oh.
Caught you red-handed!
By reading Teetle the Timid Taxidermist.
"Well, I guess I should say ""Thanks?"""
"Thank you, everybody. Thank you."
What?
"Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious."
"Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered!  And finally, I'd like to say that  reading totally sucks ass!"
"Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!"
"Thanks, boys."
"Oh, that was so touching."
"I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat."
Oh?
"Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow."
I found him.
"Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all."
What's this all about?
Can I go now?
Weirdo.
"I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake."
"Hello, Mr. Tweek."
Who was that?
The usual.  Ogh. Thanks. See you tomorrow.
"Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here."
"Oh, yeah. There is that."
"Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man."
"All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes.  My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out?"
"B L O O uh oh-O spells ""blue"" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown."
Right.
Ready.
"Damn, he's quick!"
"No, I'm sorry."
"No, it's all me. Uh, my bad."
Sorry.
Blue?
Uh. Blue is blue?
Where am I?
Okie-dokie.
Four?
Jakov
"Okay, so just what is going on here, people?"
What?
Are you sure?
So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
"Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen?"
"That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt."
"Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top."
What the hell is that thing??
"Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!"
Oh?
"Okay buddy, you can explain downtown!"
The South win?
"Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder."
Hey!
Bill Cosby?
"Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!"
"Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening."
Hello?
Who is this?
Yes. Are you calling about the abduction?
"Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican?"
"We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day.  It wasn't the abductors, sorry."
"Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!"
"Could I see your license, please?"
"Well then, I have to take you to jail."
"I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh."
