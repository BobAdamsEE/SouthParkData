The evil imaginary characters are approaching! Lock down the gates! Prepare to fire the cannons!
What imaginary character are you?!
And what imaginary character are you?
"What's a ""Butters""?"
So YOU came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists! That seems like quite a coincidence!
You caught the Leprechaun? Take him!
That is for the Council of Nine to decide!
"Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but this boy has infiltrated from the real world."
Aslan! We're losing the battle!
Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control.
