"Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown!  Yes, Your Majesty?"
"Full sail, Your Majesty?"
The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!
Fire at will!
"Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution."
"You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you."
"All right men, come on. We're going in."
Go inside! Move!
Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out.
We're going to search everyone and get statements! And the-
Got who?
"Hohhh, they got them."
That's definitely a Japanese boat.  Looks like they're whaling now.
Pull up next to them. The fight is on!
Are we ready to do this?
Are we badasses?
Are we badasses?
"All right, so... what do we do?  Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media they did it?"
"Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis?"
Why not?
You know what? He's right. It's time to bring out the big guns! You guys ready?  Ready? And... throw the stinky butter at them!
"Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one."
"Well no, that'd be illegal."
We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!
"This is the U.S. Coast Guard! We have instructions to take you by force, if necessary!"
Fire.
God damn it.
"You people just don't give up, do ya?"
Alright what the hell is going on here?!
Stall them. I don't want that plane landing anywhere until we know what the hell we're dealing with!
Survival of what?
Oh my God.
Baka! Kora wa sugoi cheating desu!Â 
"Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit.  And over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too.  Well, we should be arriving in Los Angeles in about two hours. Until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service."
"All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him."
"All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him."
"Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters."
"I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts!"
"All right, kid! End of the line!"
"Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it?"
