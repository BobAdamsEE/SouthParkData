You want to bring Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to trial for raping Indiana Jones.
"Uh kids, kids, I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous."
You don't have a case here. You can't really say that Spielberg and Lucas raped Indiana Jones in the new film.
"Yes I saw it, but I-  But I just try not to think about it."
"I don't know what I saw!  All right?! I mean, it wa-it was dark in the theater... I mean... yeah, things got a little out of hand with the plot... the third act took too long, uh-"
"GET OUT! JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!  No, no..."
Hey leave him alone!
Nooo... Nohoho...  Waaait!  Wait I... want to help!
"It's all right there in front of you, Detective. Five sworn statements from these... brave boys. It's now up to you."
