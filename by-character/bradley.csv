"Humble yourselves therefore under God's might hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6"
Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22.
Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.
"So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7."
That's... that's mine.
"Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble."
"I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused."
"You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great.  Oh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!"
"I think, I, I th-, I think I like you."
You do?
You like like me?
"Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves!"
Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God!
It's too late.
I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!
Yeah.
I think. I think I'd like to come down now.
Will you guys play with me?
"Please, can I just- oh g'uh!  Mu-Mysterion! Wuh what's goin'- Uh, that's okay, sis. I'll play with you another time."
Mysterion is here! He must have come for my help.  No time to waste. Time for Bradley Biggle to transform.  Shablagoo!
We're going to see our friend Bebe.
Who is she with?
