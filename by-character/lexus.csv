Hey guys.
How are we doing this afternoon?
"I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool."
So what can I get you?
Great. I'll put your order in right now.
"Raisins, girls!"
"Oooh, sweetie, are you leaving?"
"Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see you again??"
As soon as possible!
"Oooh, you are such a sweetie. Come here, youuu!"
"Okay, Porsche, see you tomorrow. Bye, Mercedes."
"Uh oh. Uh, hi, sweetie."
"Oh, really?  Huhunh, that's great. Uhm, Maury..."
Could you uh just help walk me to my- bike?
"Thanks again for the big tip. You are such a sweetie. Come back and see me real soon, okay?"
"Oh wow. Thanks, cutie."
"Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten all night. Thank you.  Well I gotta go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins and see me again, okaaay?"
"Oh gee, that would be great, honey, but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell you what: you come back to Raisins and then we'll be able to hang out all we want, okay?"
"Bye, cutie!"
"Hey, cutie."

Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Lexus.
"Hi, sweetie! Who's this?"
"Oh, okay. Hi, cutie.  Hey sweetie.  So how are you, honey?"
"Good, good."
"Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie.  Why don't you just come down to Raisins?"
"Awww, that's too bad, cutie. I really wanna see you."

Hi. Welcome to Raisins.
"What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend."
