"Tom, I'm reporting from the middle of a protest where two fourth grade students are fed up, and have decided to occupy Red Robin. Occupy Red Robin has been going on for several hours now, and boys, technically I am part of the 99% so, what do I have to say about all this?"
"Tom, Occupy the Restroom has been going on for almost thirty minutes now. Certainly a sign that this country is more divided than ever. These 99%ers are fed up,  and as a result you can clearly see this restroom is ""OCCUPIED.""  Uh, Tom, it looks like the movement is finished, but from the time it took, it must have been a pretty decent-sized movement."
