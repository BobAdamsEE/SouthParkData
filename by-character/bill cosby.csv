Oh! There he is comin' down the stairs.
"Hello, son. Your savethelivingroom hash tag is getting a lot of attention and we think it's great."
"I'm just a small part of a big epic holiday special, which is gonna air this weekend.  It's a shame how families don't gather in their living rooms like they used to, and we think a big holiday special is just the thing America needs now."
Well the producers of the show saw how much your idea was trending and thought we should get your hash-tag on board with ours.
Great! I'll go right now and tell them you're on board. We've gotta do this quickly!
"This holiday special is gonna bring families together again, son!"
Happy Holidays! 
"Well it's very nice, actually"
"Very, very comfy."
