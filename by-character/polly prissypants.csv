"Yeah, that's right Eric. You don't need to grow up. You are awesome and keeewl."
"Why would somebody hurt Clyde Frog, Eric? Especially because you are so awesome and keewl."
Does everything look okay?
"Shut your fat piehole, bitch!"
"It's okay, Eric. It's over now."
"Don't you see? The kids at school were right, Eric. It was time for us to grow up."
"Yes, they're gone. And now we can grow up and be together."
"They were holding us back! All the kids making fun of you at school, saying you're not keewl! Your stuffed animals all have to be gotten rid of, don't you see?!"
"No, I thought of everything! It all happened here so that everyone would think Token did it. All the blame will be on him. And we can live happily ever after."
Oh no! You're totally right! But I thought my plan was perfect! I failed! I failed you! You have to kill me Eric! So that you don't get blamed!
"It's the only way Eric. You have to do it. Please! I can't live with myself after what I've done. Please, you have to do it Eric."
"Say ""hello"" to the sunrise for me."
