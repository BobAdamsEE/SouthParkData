"Hurry up, girls. We must bundle up against the cold."
"Very good, my girls. I only wish it weren't your last show. I love this country so very much."
"Yes, yes, of course. Just give me vone second to finish getting them ready.  This way, girls. Quickly."
Your mother did not want you to grow up in Romania. This is our only chance.
"Okay girls, the Cam Ay Alta."
"Very good, Glacas."
We are very sorry to disturb you. My granddaughters are cold and tired. Is there any possibility we could pay you for a place to sleep?
Yes. We- missed our train. If we could shelter here; it would only be for one night.
"Oh, thank you so much."
Vladchick.
Yes. You're avefully soo kind to my little granddaughters.
"Yes, as I was back in my day. I was a contortionist, too."
Yes.
