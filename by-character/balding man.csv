No. Don't forget we've got these too.
"You have a home here, friend."
"I don't know if you can stay. We'll have to ask Dr. Cornwallis. Come.  We don't normally allow outsiders. See, here we live in harmony with animals. They're not our pets but our fellow living beings. We work with the animals and try to live as they do.  We make friends with the animals. We coexist, and we... intermarry.  This is my wife, Janice.  The outside world looks down on a man marrying a llama, but our love knows no boundaries."
And why not? Mark here has been with Kelly for three years now.  And Gary and Sally here have just managed to have a child together.
"Yes, life here is good and natural. But now that you know where our compound is, you'll either have to live with us, or be murdered."
It's not up to you. You'll have to talk with Dr. Cornwallis.  What did he say?
Excellent! Dr. Cornwallis is wise beyond his year. Here's your PeTA shirt and a bumper sticker.
"Stan, I want to introduce you to my stepdaughter, Teresa.  She seems to have taken a liking to you.  And she's ovulating."
"Stan, some PETA members are growing concerned that maybe you don't love animals."
"You... don't belong here, Stan. You should return home."
"But, why on earth wouldn't you wanna vote?"
"But Stan, don't you know? It's always between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Nearly every election since the beginning of time has been between some douche and some turd. They're the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics."
"Janice, we shall die together in each other's arms!"
