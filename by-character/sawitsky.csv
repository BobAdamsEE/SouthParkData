"There've been a lot of ""stories"" about the first Thanksgiving, and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the Pilgrims look good, and my people being degraded as usual. Was Thanksgiving about turkey and peace? Or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race?"
What are you doing?!
The first Thanksgiving was a space treaty?! Native Americans are aliens?!
Haven't my people been through enough?!  Goddamn you!
The white man is gonna PAY for his lies!
Just keep writing your apology!
Huh?  Ack.
