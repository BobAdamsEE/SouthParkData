I am!  And I don't want no new cellmate!
"Oh, I will!  You bet your ass I will."
"Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!"
"Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!"
...Neither do we
"No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in ""friends."""
"Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here."
"Well, did you get the cigarettes?"
Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards.
You flushed them?!
"No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me."
"Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game.  Ew, it smells, man."
"You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!"
I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?
"Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house.  Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw  Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess.  Hey. Uh, what are you doing?  You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!"
Dude.
"Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here."
"Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland."
Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us!  Mph. Oowww!
It's my leg! I think it's broken.  You go on ahead without me.
"Hey.  You're supposed to say, ""I'm not going without you,"" or something."
"Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends."
I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these.
"No! You're supposed to say, ""I can't take these,"" or something, dumbass!"
Take them. They'll bring you luck.  Now go on. Get out of here.
Yeah?
Eric!
Wow! I've never had a visitor before!
You did?
Yeah.
Whoa!
"Oh, yeah!"
"Oh, the monorail!"
