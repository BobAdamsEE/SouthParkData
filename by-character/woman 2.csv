I've got balls!
The whales are taking out the crab fisherman reality show!
Look out!

Hope.
Hai.
"Uh, marching's really not for me."
Did you see that shit?

"Oh Mark, I love you."
"Oh Jesus, no!"

It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives.
"Oh hello, Ms. Claridge. Nice day, isn't it?"
"Yeah, like, when men shave their balls it's fine, but when a woman does it she's ""straaange."""
The corporations run the entire world. And now they fooled you into working for them.
Oh my God!
And I broke the dam.
Well it may represent her sorrow over all the bad things going on in the world.
