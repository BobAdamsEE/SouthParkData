"Hey guys, how's it going?"
I'm here to investigate a murder.
"Jesus, we've been working hard since we got your distress call!"
"More than friends, young boy, we are super best friends, with the desire to fight for justice."
"Jesus, come look at this.  After your distress call, we entered David Blaine in the super best friends' computer."
"Moses, scan this tape. Can you tell us the source of Blaine's power?"
Mohammad!
"It is too powerful, Jesus!"
"Krishna, we're going to need wood for a mold!"
"I will find sources to concrete.  You, get the water to mix it with, Seaman."
