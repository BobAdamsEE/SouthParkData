"Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, president and CEO of BP. Our accidental drilling spill again in the Gulf us a tragedy that should have never happened. And to all those affected, I want to say, we are deeply sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Sorry.  BP has taken full responsibility for cleaning up this spill in the Gulf, and in doing so, we've changed our name from Beyond Petroleum, to Dependable Petroleum.  We no longer fuck the earth, we DP it."
"Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, CEO of DP. Tearing a hole into another dimension is a tragedy that should have never happened. And as CEO, I would like to say... We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Sohr-ry."
"Yes, I'm afraid it's going to take more than another ""I'm sorry"" campaign to please everyone this time."
"Wait a tick!  Currents and swells, that's it! I think I know how to fix this!"
We drill.
"I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill."
"We got into this mess by drilling heuh , and heuh . Now, we need to drill heuh!"
"Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time."
"Oh, she'll take it."
"As president of DP Oil, I want to say... We're sorry.  I'm deeply sorry.  Sorry."
We're sorry.
We're sorry.
Sorry.
"Hello, I'm Tony Hayward. The tragic spill in the Gulf is a disaster that should have never happened. And as head of the oil company responsible, I would like to say, what should I do?  Should I admit we've made mistakes?  Should I remind you we've done this before? What should I do? Should I find newer and better ways to say I'm sorry?"
What should I do?
"Or should I tell you, ""I am not a role model."""
Should I accept my role as the villain?
Should I not have listened to my technicians who said a spill wouldn't happen? They're my technicians!
