"Clyde? Clyde, I told you this morning to take the garbage out.  Clyde, do you hear me?"
"Oooo well, the day had to come."
"Clyde, sometimes people like to pretend with make-believe characters. He's not really a lie, he's like ahh..."

"Clyde! Clyde! Clyde, get up here! Hurry!"
What is that?
"That's right. It's a toilet, Clyde. And where is the toilet seat? It's up, because you left it up, again! We've been through this countless times, Clyde."
"No, not okay. Because you aren't getting the message! What if I'd fallen in? Start listening to me! Put it down! Put it down!  Thank you."
Clyde! Clyde!  There you are!
"Clyde Donovan, you come home this instant!"
What have I told you about putting the toilet seat down after you go to the bathroom?
"How many times do I have to tell you Clyde? I was trying to get ready for work and the toilet seat was up, again."
"No, Roger! It's a disgusting habit and I'm sick and tired of it. If I had sat down, I would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina."
"You're coming home right now, and you're putting the seat down where it belongs. Let's go."
"Clyde! Clyde!  Clyde, I want you to know I don't blame you for this. We should have been h-h-harder on you all those times you left the toilet seat up."
"Shhh! Sh! I.. don't... have a lot of time, Clyde. Just please put the toilet seat down from now on for your sister's sake, please. Oh, God, please let me go. Let me go. Do it! Do it! Do it!"
Clyde? Clyde?
This lawyer is a fraud. He has been swindling you and your friends for your money.
"You can't sue the dead, Clyde. Putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette. It's common sense, Clyde!"
Don't try and blame mommy's death on anything but your failure to something I have asked you time and time again to do.  It's your fault!
