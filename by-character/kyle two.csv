Cool.
Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it.
"Yeah, dude, it's great!"
Mom?
How am I related to him again?
"Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin?"
So we have the same blood?
What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?
"What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart!"
Oh my God.
Well what do you mean?  What room is he sleeping in?
"I don't know, dude."
I don't think so.
Okay.
"Cartman, I need to talk to you."
"Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal."
"That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him."
"But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'."
And you especially can't say anything about Jews!
"Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it?"
Alright.
"Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend-ish."
What?
CARTMAN!
"You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, ""Catch the Ball."" I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me."
It's fine!
"Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it.  Alright, here we go."
Now throw it back to me.
...So dig it out.
"...Well, then we'll dry them off!"
Oh my God.
"Yeah! They WERE, Cartman!"
"You did, too! You are so full of crap!"
"You blew the deal, Cartman!"
"Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You ripped on him, deal's off!"
Oh no.
"Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you."
"Kyle, I-eh I'm sorry."
What?
"Uh-uh-uh oh, dude. Uh"
"I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane."
"I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews."
Ya see?
Ugh.
"Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn."
"Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on."
Hang on!
How far do you think it is to Connecticut?
Think he'll be alright?
"...Hm, that was pretty gay."
"I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding."
"You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut."
"Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her."
I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility.
AAA!
"A, a bus. R-really?"
"Oh no- don't worry about it, dude."
"Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport."
"Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave.  Ey! Can we speed things up here??"
"Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?!"
No!
This is ridiculous! Come on!
"Okay, Cartman, you're it. Start counting."
"Here, Kyle. You go hide in here."
JUST GET IN THE BOX!
I hope he doesn't suffocate.
"I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air."
"I already checked the playground, Ma.  I told you, he isn't really-"
GAAAH!
"No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home."
I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.
...What?
"Do you promise??  I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you?"
"Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon.  Not too soon, I hope."
Dudedudedude! You- you have five million dollars??
"Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay!"
"Yeah. You see, I've learned something today.  Sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,...  and um... Let's see, what did I learn about?  What did I learn about today?"
"Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?"
... Uhwhat?
Dude! Weak.
