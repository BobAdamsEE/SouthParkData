Don't forget to bring a towel!
"Welcome to the party, boys!  HAAARRRHHHH!!"
HAAARRRHHHH!!
What are you doing?
"Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them."
"They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now."
"You're going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness.  Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you've had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!"
"You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high."
"Come, Towelie! Make your decision!"
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
