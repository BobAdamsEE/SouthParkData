"All right, now we all want you to have a good time. but as Heidi's parents, tonight it is our responsibility to look out for all of you. There's not gonna be any drinking, no pot, and most importantly, if I catch any boys anywhere near this party, they're gonna be in a world of hurt.  All right, have a nice time, girls."
Aha! I knew it! Boys in the slumber party!
