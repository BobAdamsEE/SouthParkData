"Thanks, Tom. I'm here at the house of little Billy Circlovich, um. Billy is in desperate need of a bone-marrow transplant  or he will most certainly die.  Billy, how much more money do you need for the transplant?"
"Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya!"
"Well, that's a lot of money.How the hell are you gonna get all that in the short amount of time you have left?"
"Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today."
"Billy, we want you to put that tooth under your pillow tonight, because we have a feeling that the tooth fairy  is going to leave you six hundred dollars for it!"
"Yes, really.  Six hundred dollars. I might also mention that Billy lives in Crestview Apartments, just off Arapaho Road on Emporia Street. Back to you, Tom.  How was that?"
