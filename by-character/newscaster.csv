"The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking timebomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony."
"Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?"
Huh?
"As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary."
"It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava."
And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.
"Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?"
Oh my God! What has he done?
"As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors."
"Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is...  Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement!"
