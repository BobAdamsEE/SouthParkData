"Oh, but, but she's ugly, right?"
We've got a chance. Hostages are clear!
Hostages are secure at the park entrance!

They got 'em. It's over.
"We'll get right on it, Mysterion. Thank you. Thank you for all your help.  Godspeed, Mysterion!"
"Something wrong, sir?"

"Sir, it's possible with the crane we could help any survivors out."
"Captain Hindsight? Captain Hindsight, please come in!"
The oil keeps coming out! We've got other rigs now catching fire!

"This is John and Patsy Ramsey, from Boulder."
"Hey Murphy, think they'll let me borrow their G.I. Joes?"
Yeah! Who the hell are you to say that?!
"That's right. Come on, bring it!"
They're lying.
"So, Trent, you just had to finish off your old preschool teacher, eh?"
