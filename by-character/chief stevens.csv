"We've got a critical situation, ma'am. Charlie Manson is holding everybody inside hostage."
"Yes, ma'am."
Come out with your hands up!
"Look out, he's got a white flag!"
They're surrendering!
"You're going back to prison to rot, Manson!"
What??
Stop that.
"Happy Holidays, Bob."
"Come on, Manson. You belong in jail."
