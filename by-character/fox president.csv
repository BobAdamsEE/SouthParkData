"Family Guy is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't."
"Yes, Mr. President."
"Mr. President, my hands are tied. The Family Guy writers insist I don't censor Mohammad."
"Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know."
"Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know."
"Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup."
"All right, let's get this over with."
I feel terrible. It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.
"Little boy, will you talk to the Family Guy writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode."
"Take this noble child over to the Family Guy offices. If he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the Mohammad episode after all."
What was that?
I don't understand it. What's wrong with them?
"But, nobody took any idea balls out of the tank, did they?"
Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!
"You're right. It's time I stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do! I'm pulling the Mohammad episode, you got that?! And if you all don't want to work tomorrow, you can just find other jobs!!  How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!"
I gotta hurry!
Network Control! This is the President! I want you to pull the episode.
I'm sure. Begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900.
President approval code  0-0-destruct-
Who are you?
The end of Family Guy?
"Hold on, Julie!  What are you talking about, kid?"
You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network?
Ah... I don't know who to listen to!
"Okay, I'll listen to you.  Julie?"
But he has a gun.
I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me.
I shouldn't even be in the office still. It's supposed to be half-day Friday.
"How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again."
Family Guy goes on air as planned. Uncensored.
