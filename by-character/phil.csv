"Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again."
Dude! Now that is not cool.
"That's gotta hurt, Frank."
Dude!
"Wow, we have to go."
Little crybaby!
"Hello, folks, I'm Phil and this is Josh . We're with the Aspen Time-Share Company."
"Well, we can't wait to show you what Aspen Time-Share is offering investors. Shall we do our thirty-minute meeting?"
"And so, we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in Phase 4."
"Oh, I know, that's what everybody says - ""Not me, I can't afford it."" But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars!"
"Well you see, ""time-share"" means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves  You  ""share"" the condo with other investors and pick the  ""time"" you want to stay."
"Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, ""I've got a little place in Aspen."""
"Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary ""I've got a nice little place in Aspen?"" Hahaha! Just kidding, wives."

"Welcome back, folks!"
...And so you see it's the investment opportunity that keeps on giving.
"Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want. Of course, that is, if you don't want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show."
"That's only a couple thousand each, Josh!"
"Folks, I'm glad you're back, because we forgot to mention, time-share condos are still deeded properties!"
"Oooo, you folks really lucked out this time. You're visitor number one thousand!"
That's right!
"The police, the mayor, the president of the United States. Perhaps now you see the severity of your situation. I think we shall all sit down...  and listen to the presentation."
