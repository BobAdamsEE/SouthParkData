How our we to know that they will let us go? Their offer could be a trap.
"Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key."
I need more spinach for Popeye!
"Watch that window, Puck!  Everyone, make sure this room isn't bugged!  Alright Stan, listen up! We don't have a lot of time! You've been told Asperger's is real! It isn't! It's just a front we use to stay hidden!"
"Of course not! If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it Asperger's! That's just, that's just mean!  There's a big war going on out there, Stan, and we want you to join our fight to bring it all down!"
"You've broken through their reality and they don't like it! Others deserve to know the truth! You see everything as shit, don't you?!  Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music, all you see and hear is shit! Am I right?"
"We found a way to make it stop, Stan. Now are you interested? Or not?"
"Alright, is he ready to be sent in?"
"We are the Secret Society of Cynics.  Everything looks like shit to you, right? What if I were to tell you... that you're seeing the world the way it actually is?"
The world around us has all completely turned to shit. But aliens are putting out a brainwave that keeps most people seeing a false reality
"Or, robots from the future, whatever. The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance."
"Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you! All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down. They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you! Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?"
Let's send him in!  Drink this.
He's back!  Did you see the illusionary world again?
"Try and focus, Stan: we've found them! We know where the rock creatures are now."
"Or aliens, or AI- things. Whatever, fuck you."
"Come on kid, there's not a lot of time left."
"Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion. We're sending you back in!"
You vampire sons of bitches!
"Alright, nice work Stan. Now comes the final step! You have to take out Duck President!"
"But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was!"
