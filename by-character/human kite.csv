The Human Kite!
That's definitely the last of them.
"What do you mean ""Not Cartman,"" dude?"
"Dude, Kenny, ch-chill out."
"My mom did tell me I had to be home by five, I-"
"Here we go: ""The Necronomicon contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them."""
"Ten arrested in South Park for cultish activity. This is from like, ten years ago."
"Hey wait a minute. Dude. Mysterion, it's your parents."
"Oh my God, look! Back row. Aren't those the Goth kids?"
"I'm not sure, Toolshed. Could it be a riddle, Mysterion? M-! Mysterion?"
Human Kite!
You bastards!
Let's go.
But then what exactly is your superpower?
And shoot lasers out of my eyes.

"Alright. dude, let, let's just say you're not crazy and it's true. What's the big deal? I mean, I think it'd be pretty cool not to be able to die."

"What help, dude? Nobody in the real world even knows we're here."
"Kenny, where the hell are you going?"
You... you crazy bastard!
And finally the evil Coon is right where he belongs.
You're not going anywhere for a long time!
"Well, come back and visit any time, dude."
Kenny? No! Nooo!
