"Hello, boys. Congratulations on getting this far."
I am... Wall-Mart.
I've taken this form in order to talk to you. But I can take many forms.  Does this suit you better? Or perhaps you prefer this form?  I can take whichever form I like.
"To find the heart of Wall-Mart, one must first ask oneself, ""Who is it that asked the question?"""
"Ah, yes, but who are you?"
"Ah. You know the answer, but not the question!"
Very well. You want to see the heart of Wall-Mart? It lies beyond that plasma-screen television.
"Yes, don't you see? That is the heart of Wall-Mart. You, the consumer. I take may forms: Wall-Mart, K-Mart, Target. But I am one single entity: Desire!"
"Gaaah! No! No, what have you done?!  Now you shall see my true form!  Now you see me as I truly am!"
