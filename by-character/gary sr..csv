"Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh is here!"
I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to have you over.
Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him.
"Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry."
"You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said ""Who the heck do these people think they are?!"" I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again."
"To each his own, right?"
"Well, because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates, right where the angel Moroni said they would be."
"Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be?"
"Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out with your friend Stan?"
"Yeah. Have a good time, boys."
"Ohohoho, really? Wel, that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the Joseph Smith story! The one that proves he was for real!"
"Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat?"
"See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home."
And that's how it happened.
"Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't it?"
"Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs."
Well kids... Who's up for a water balloon fight?!
