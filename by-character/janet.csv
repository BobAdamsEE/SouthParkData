"Yeah, I've been told that."
Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.
Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.
He-yeah. Done what?
"Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?"
Oh jeez.
But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa.
I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!
"Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda  scissor or something."
I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.
"Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!"
"Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson!"
"Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!"
"Hey Tracy, hey Kate."
"Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on?"
Hey Patty.
"Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes."
"Oh yeah, dyke fight!  You kicked me right in the pussy!  Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor!"
"Yeah, this is our home."
Persians?!
We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!
"Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!"
That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!
"Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!"
"Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!"
"Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!"
"We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them ""We aren't leaving Les Bos."""
"No, it's Les Bos!  We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!"
I knew it! I knew it!
Would you allow straight people in? Men?
"Choose your next words wisely, Persian!"
"No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos!"
Lesbos! Positions!
The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!
Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight!  Don't give them an inch!  Ow! Iranian faggot!
Never!
Lesbohhhs!
"Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic."
We can't? I think it's pretty fun.
"Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside."
"If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!"
It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.
"Sure they do.  Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne.  Persian."
"All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too."
"And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time."
"Take positions, Lesbos!"
"No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans."
Let them through. It's okay.
Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?
A-are you sure?
"What secret?!  Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?"
It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.
Because we're protecting the only home we have.
"You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am."
"That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you.  I know you're actually a woman."
I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.
"Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking.  But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!"
"Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?"
"Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!"
"Yeah, scissor!"
"Thanks for everything, Xerxes."
The school hired a substitute to cover for me.
