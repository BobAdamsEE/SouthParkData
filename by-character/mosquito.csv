Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends?
"Have, so."
There's like a big fire or something in town.
And friends!
"Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it."
...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like.
"Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero."
I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale.
"I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people."
And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch!
"No, but we are all equal! From now on, we vote! Who wants to go with my plan?"
Right.
Mosquito!
"That's almost it, superheroes. We're about out of lemon bars."
Ten. Yes sir!
Stop who?
I knew it! Cartman tore our base up!
"Right, Toolshed!"
"Okay Mom, just give me two minutes.  Nag nag nag."
"Let him go!  Coon and Friends, ho! Mosquito!"
"Yeah, come on, get your costume on, lazy-ass!"
Perhaps we should make more lemon bars to raise money for people in need.
I was bitten by a radioactive mosquito! Bzzzzzzt.
What are you talking about?
"You guys, I wanna go home."
"Look, maybe we should just a place to hid and wait for help."
Kenny!
