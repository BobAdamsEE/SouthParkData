"I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you."
"Howdy ho, boys? Let's get you back home."
"Howwwwdy-hoooo.  Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell."
"You know something, Kyle?  You smell an awful lot like flowers."
"Not real? Well shucks.  If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song? 
Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded goodies on his sleigh
To drop them off on Christmas Day''
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'"
"Folks'll gather round the fire
sing a song, stroll the choir
Pretty song they'll all retire
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'"
"I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we..."
Howdy-ho!
"You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle.  You're gonna catch a cold."
"Aw, gee, that's too bad."
"Say, that sounds like a swell idea.  We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas."
Howdy-ho!
"Golly, that isn't very nice.  I'd sure like to teach him a lesson."
Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!!
Kyle!  Howdy-ho.
"Santa's loaded up his sleigh
flying around his merry way..."
"Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!  Howdy, folks.  Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery."
"Howdy-ho, Chef!"
What's all the ruckus?
I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey!  STOP FIGHTING!!
"Come on, gang, don't fight.  You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it.  Don't you see?  This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, ""Aw, the heck with it!  Let's sing and dance and bake cookies"""
"Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!"
I brought some friends with me.
"Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me.  Bye-bye and Merry Christmas"
Ky-yle! Ky-yle!
Hooowwwdy ho!
Ky-yle!
Ky-yle!
Hooowwwdy ho!
"Howdy-ho, boys."
"Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht."
Have you all been brushing behind your teeth?
And usin' dental floss?
And washin' behind your ears?
"Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home."
"Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem."
"These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment."
"That's why, Kyle. That's why."
"There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me."
Don't forget to change your sheets once a week!
"Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho.  Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?"
"Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin'"
Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out.
But I won't last long up above.
"All right, just let me get my toothbrush."
"No, I'm not leaving without you.  We started this together, we're gonna finish it together."
It sure is -dry up here.
Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.  Clo-ser.
There is a-nother Sky-walk-er.
Wake up.
Come clo-ser.
Clo-ser.
"Closer!  One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture."
Kyle.
Howdy-ho.
That was delicious.
Hoooooowwwdy-ho!
"Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival."
"Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A good film festival should be something where we all say, ""Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget all those things for just a while, and just watch some new art."""
Nyyaarrrr!
"Hi, Chef. Your big chocolate balls are just the trick!"
Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength.
"I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle.  Kisses."
"HOWDY HO!
I'm Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
Season's greetings to all of you.
Let's sing songs and dance and play 
Now, before I melt away 
Here's a game I like to play:
Stick me in your mouth and try to say,"
Christmastime has come!
"Howdy-ho, folks. We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world."
"Woohoo! Golly, that sure was fun. But now, for our next song, hold on to your bootstraps, 'cause we're gonna descend down into Hell!"
"Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman."
"Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison."
"Golly, that sure was swell. I'd say my Christmas special is going super-fantastic. Well, now it's time to hear from perhaps the two most important people of the whole season."
"Well, I guess that's about the end of my Christmas album. Gosh! It was sure nice hangin' out with y'all again. Well, I guess if there's just... one thing I have left to say, it would be this:
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
May your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay. 
From now on, our troubles will be miles away."
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
"Goodbye, everybody,  and Meeeeerry Christmas!"
Hoowwddyy ho!
"Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle."
"I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family.  Honey!"
"Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn."
"They're too young to drink, honey."
"Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids!  This is our son, Cornwallis."
Our daughter Amber.
"And our son, Simon."
Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head.
"Nothin', Simon."
It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.
"Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer!  And if you want, you can help them."
"Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay?"
"Honey, can we go inside for a second?  Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas!"
Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase!  Don't you throw that vase!
"Oh, Kyle! Hoowwddy ho!"
"Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?"
"Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that projector workin'! Don't you worry!"
"Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in."
"Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas."
"But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!"
"We're having a talk, honey."
"Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up."
"...Now come on, son. Don't be so down."
Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!
"No, you're not a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?"
"But crap is everything. 
Everything that lives on earth poos in some way
And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day
Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky
It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why
Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men
It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again
And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea.
And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal.
And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside
Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive
By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand
So it can spring to life and become food for the land!
It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe
It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass
''The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end
To make food for the humans and start all over again
You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life."
"Just like your heart beats without you thinking about it, so, too, your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it. But it is all one life form. It is all...  you."
Becomes the grass of tomorrow
Which the grazers turn around
Hoowwddy ho!  Down here!
My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.
"Uh-uh, honey, please don't start!"
"They're not real, you know."
"Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn!"
"Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work."
"Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy"
O-kay!
It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do!
"Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry."
It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.
"Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap."
"Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'"
Son...  You're the smartest piece of crap since Albert Poodinger! Come on!
"No, you did it, boys!"
"Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'?"
"Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit!  I know someone who can help. Santa Claus!"
Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away!
"Oh, that's no problem! We just need a little Christmas magic.  All aboard the Poo Choo Express!"
"Next stop, the North Pole!"
"Let's go, Poo Choo Train!"
Poo Choo Train's layin' down its tracks with a
All the way and back!
Christmastime wouldn't be the same without hugs and kisses and a Poo Choo Train.
"Here we are, kids. The North Pole."
That's it. Santa's Fortress of Solitude.
We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business.
"Howdy ho, Santa!"
All ready for Christmas?
"Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric."
All right!
"Hey, it looks like Santa has already made it to Baghdad."
It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them.
Santa! Are you alright?
"Hey, that's right. Jesus can save anybody."
Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time!
We should be able to find Jesus in no time!
Hooowdy ho!
Do you know a way?
"Howdy ho, Jesus."
More soldiers are coming!
Start the sleigh!
"What are you doin', Santa?"
"Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy now!"
"I'll help you, Santa!"
