No! I have had it!
"Look at what you've done to my boy! You told Horace that he was responsible for his weight! You made him believe that with exercise and proper diet, he could be thin! When we told you it was his genetics!"

Your time is up!
And I'm going to call all the other parents to tell them to come claim their kids as well! Your camp is a WASTE ...of time!
What?!
