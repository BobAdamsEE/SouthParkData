"Okay, just continue with your macaroni pictures. Teacher has to step out for a second. Uh Ike, could you help me out, please?  Oh Ike, I just had to have a second alone with you."
"I got your love letter, and I wrote you one back. Oh, just one kiss to hold me over for the rest of class."
"Oh uhh, we were just heading back in."
I don't need a hall pass. I'm a teacher.
"Look, just let us get back in-"
We're going back inside!
Bear mace??
Oooooh!
Oh God...
"I'm at the police station. They say they found some evidence. I'm so scared.  Listen, I want you to know it's okay. If anybody tries to talk to you, you don't need to say anything. Just leave it to me. I know a way out of this."
"I am deeply sorry to announce that the allegations against me are true. Over the past several weeks, I have been having physical relations with one of my students."
"I know my actions were wrong, but I cannot be fully to blame. You see, I am an alcoholic."
"Yes, I'm afraid it's true."
"I am a perfectly good person, but when I drink, the alcohol makes me say and do things I wouldn't normally do."
"No, but my uncle used to ask me and my twin sister to loss and he'd take pictures."
All better now.
Ike.
"Ike, we have to get out of here! They'll never let us be together. I think... I think we should go to Milan, like we always talked about."
Get your things together. We don't have much time.
"Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?"
But what about me? I want to talk.
Oh no! Ike!  They're on to us!
Hurry darling! We have to get out of here!
"Come on, darling!"
"Ike, run!"
Why couldn't you just leave us alone? All we wanted was to love.
"It's all over, Ike. Milan, the house in Tuscany. They'll never let us be together! We have to go with the backup plan."
You can't accept our love? So then we can only be together in eternity.
You who don't believe in true love don't understand.
"I'm afraid you're too late.  Are you ready, my love?  Here we go! One, two, three, aaaahhh!  Ike??"
