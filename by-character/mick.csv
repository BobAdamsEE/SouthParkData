"You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this."
"Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little and... maybe you can play it for free."
"Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all."
"Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?"
