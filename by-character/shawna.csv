"Okay, Mom."
Hi Jimmy.
"Thanks, Jimmy. Where are we going?"
You know that girl Sally Rauman at our school? I can't stand her.
"Really? Well, Kelligan bought the same purse and I was like, ""No WAY do I want it now!"" because who wants a purse that both their best friends have, right? And so-"
"I guess that's why I figured, ""Who needs friends like THAT?"""
"It's like I told Debbie: ""If you're gonna go out with my friends-"""
"""And so if you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend."""
"You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener."
"Yeah. I mean, no other boys really communicate like you do."
...What???  I'm not doing that!
Creep!
