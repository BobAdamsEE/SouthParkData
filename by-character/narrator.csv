"The year is 2006, and young Eric Cartman cannot wait for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Unable to cope with the wait any longer, Eric decides to freeze himself for three weeks. But a freak avalanche makes Eric impossible to find, and so he remains frozen for 500 years."
"And so it had begun. By kicking the Persian messenger in the balls, the lesbos had sent a message. . All over the country lesbians heard of the brave standoff."
The Persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in.
"The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the Persians from entering."
"For hours, the Lesbos kept the Persians back, holding them off, keeping them from decorating.  Finally the Persians grew tired. and many of them wanted to go shopping for more designer sunglasses. They retreated.  The Lesbos... had held."
The Persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss.
Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer with customized Gucci accessories which only a Persian would think was cool.
And with that the Persian club owner came to a realization.
"A full day passed, and the Lesbos knew a second Persian attack was imminent. Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch, ready to alert the others. The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside. Her plan to dress Mexicans as Persians to act as spies - perhaps it had failed. She looked around at her fellow Lesbos. They were tired. In order to keep her Lesbos awake, she had no choice: she would have to make coffee.  With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos found new life, but would it be enough?"
"And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails."
"Little Stanley was tired and hungry. But he knew that for Britney Spears to be safe, he had to get her to the North Pole."

"Captain Hindsight,  the hero of the modern age. Once a reporter for the National News, Jack Brolin always had a knack for hindsight.  Wanting to become the best-known reporter in the country, Jack tried an experiment to boost his hindsight levels. But then a freakish accident occurred when a retroactive spider got into the equipment. The reporter's hindsight was blasted to superhuman levels!

"It is a glorious spring morning and literally thousands have gathered for the royal wedding.  People are still filing inside the abbey to watch the prince and princess of Canada exchange their vows. What a great day for Canadians everywhere.  The Winnipeg players playing the March Of A Thousand Farts, as is traditional for the Canadian Royal Family.  All the biggest Canadian celebrities are on hand. There are Sirs Terrance and Phillip, with their wives, the lovely Queef Sisters.  I believe tha-yes, I believe that one of the sisters just queefed, just now.  There are Canadian recording artists, Sir Bryan Adams and Sir Corey Hart. Everyone is looking smashing today. And- Ah, there he is! The Prince of Canada.  What a wonderful day it is for him; what a wonderful day it is for all of us. Inside the abbey now, everyone waiting with anticipation. There's the Queen of Canada, in attendance of course.  I believe she just queefed. The Prince makes his way down the aisle led by the Bishop of Newfoundland. People in attendance now gently tossing Captain Crunch as the Prince passes by. As of course is tradition.  Prince takes his place next to the large vat of butterscotch pudding. Oh, and here she comes. Yes, there she is! The aboot to be Princess of Canada. Isn't she ravishing, so innocent of heart, so strong in body, so hot in the face? She is indeed the living symbol of our great country. My God, she's beautiful."
"Canadian prince now dipping his arms into the pudding.  As is tradition.  Princess will of course scrape the pudding off the prince's arms, thus symbolizing their union. What a glorious day for our country and indeed the world. And now of course the- wait a minute. What's this? Oh. Uh oh. Something is going terribly wrong. The abbey is shaking violently	as explosions abound. The top- Yes, the top of the abbey is collapsing. The prince and the princess look on in horror. This is not the tradition. This is not tradition at all. A giant hole now blasted into the ceiling, debris falling down and crushing several spectators, which is also not the tradition for a royal Canadian wedding.  Bright beam of light shooting through the hole in the ceiling.  The princess now in some kind of... isometric cube.  This is certainly breaking with tradition now."
"Canadians in attendance cannot believe their eyes. Widespread panic.  The princess being... hoisted away. The little mushroom people of Nova Scotia, screaming with horror.  The prince is attempting to grab hold of the cube. The duke and the duchess of Calgary hiding behind the pews. This is indeed a horrible day for all of Canada, and therefore- and the pudding has just been knocked over! Oh, this does not go with tradition at all! The royal pudding now spilling all over the abbey as the princess is lifted up, up... And she's gone. The princess has been taken. This is indeed a horrible day for Canada, and therefore, the rest of the world."
"The princess now giving the Canadian Medal of Courage to Ugly Bob, and also to Scott, who is of course a giant dick, aaand Katuktuk of the Yukon. And the medal of course made of white chocolate, as is tradition. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. The duke of Calgary standing up and putting on a fake beard, a tradition passed down since the birth of Canada. The princess now knighting Sir Ike Broflovski, giving him three kisses and a pair of socks, as is tradition."
And now the scraping off of the pudding.
"And now the scraping off of the pudding.  Isn't she beautiful, scraping off the pudding with the grace of a butterfly. She rubs the pudding on her face.  The prince now attempting to remove one of the princess's arms. As is of course the tradition. The princess screaming with pain. Everyone watching with anticipation.  And the arm is off! Things are back to normal here in Canada. Time-honored traditions are once again-  yehhss, the prince is sticking the princess's arm up his ass. There it goes.  He's really making a good go of it. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore of course, the world."
"Dedicated. Patriotic. Tireless. These are the men and women of the US Border Patrol. They work around the clock protecting American prosperity. They are the front line in making sure Mexicans stay here and work. The border patrol is uncompromising, diligent, and cool.

A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?
"We know the first Thanksgiving was in the fall of 1621, but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the Pilgrims and Native Americans may have been visited by aliens!"
And what about the food?  Does the appearance of stuffing at the first Thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology?
"Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form?  What exactly did the Pilgrims experience?  How exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every November?"
"It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings."
"And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?"
"Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say ""yes."""
"Not long ago, it was an accepted fact that civilizations on Earth shared the universe with beings from other planets.  These alien beings visited our world, and once, even settled it, from deep within the galaxy Canis Major, and a distant planet called... Plymouth."
"With the wormhole once again open, Miles Standish was finally able to command a Pilgrim army."
"The Pilgrims fought off the Indians, making stuffing once again available on all our Thanksgiving tables."
And now you know the true story behind Thanksgiving.
But was the first Thanksgiving really just about Pilgrims and Indians from space? Or was there something more? Shocking new evidence suggests that the first Thanksgiving might also have been...  haunted!
"The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave?"
Pabst Blue Ribbon and white trash. It's a deadly combination that can lead to prison time and children being taken away from their home.  This white trash home in Colorado seems innocent enough.
"But the children in this home live in a world of neglect. There's no heating, no groceries,  and if you look closely in the backyard, you can even make out what appears to be a meth lab."
"Three arrests in just one power-packed episode, proving once again that we are all just one Pabst Blue Ribbon away from becoming... white trash in trouble! Sponsored by Schlitz."
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with no way out.  The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
"For four elementary school boys. an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of ""I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining""."
"It's the last day of Spring break,  and all over the small mountain town of South Park,  students are trying to have as much fun as possible.  For ten year old Stan Marsh and his friends Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the last day has come too soon."
"Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo."
It's the idyllic spring break getaway with friends and laughter.
"The boys have just made a sobering discovery.  For ten year old Stan Marsh, the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down.  The average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family.  But, in a tour group, the brain has to work overtime, acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour."
"Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, ""Dude, fuck you!"""
"The boys think their ordeal is over, but what they don't realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse."
"It's a devastating blow. For Kyle, it's almost too much to bear.  His brain is already lacking excitement, and now just the word ""shuttle"" makes Kyle's brain fire neurons  that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be."
"It's almost three o'clock, and the boys are still on the shuttle."
"But what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing.  Last night, Eric Cartman had kung pao spaghetti from California Pizza Kitchen.  Inside Eric's stomach, the kung pao has just met with the Del Taco he ate for breakfast. It has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque BK toppers that have been building up for months.  And now, to compensate for all the annoying tourists, Eric is ingesting massive amounts of Mountain Dew.  The caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fast-food liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas.  When the gas is released, it carries with it tiny particles of Eric's fecal matter.  Fecal matter which floats up and into Kyle's nasal passage."
"After a grueling twenty minutes, waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline, the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time. And that, is when the unthinkable happens."
The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun.
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group.
The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
"But what the boys don't realize is that Eric's body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea.  Inside his stomach, bile has just dislodged an Arby's Ultimate Angus. In the average human, this would only cause mild diarrhea.  But Eric Cartman is now drinking Double Dew, a Mountain Dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular Mountain Dew.  His rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste.  The diarrhea shoots out of Eric's anus and into his underwear.  Eric Cartman is a ticking time bomb."
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour.
"An attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on... ""I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining"""
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  Trapped on a 42-foot powerboat  which is only allowed to go five miles an hour.
The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
"For four elementary school boys, an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on... ""I Should Have Never Got On A Goddamn Boat"""
"After cleaning Cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers, the boys have made a terrifying discovery: that boating is just as boring as ziplining."
"If the boys fall asleep now, from the lack of excitement, they could die."
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  And just when it seems it can't get any worse...
Kenny McCormick has died of boredom.
"But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered."
"After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter.  In the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that Mr. Hankey then had to fly them on his Seven Turdy Seven.  From there, it was only an hour ride back home on the Poochoo Express.  Four friends, turn apart by tragedy , would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. Kenny McCormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents.  And the boys received treatment for their herpes."
"Kyle Broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. Stan Marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining.  His awareness videos became so popular that Stan once again ended up jacking it in San Diego. As for Eric Cartman,  he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math."
"His wife is having sex with the neighbor.  And when her husband comes home,  he wants more than just a divorce. "
"Tonight at 10, it's a tale of lust, seduction, and murder, on Sexy Betrayals.  Then at 7, some like their murder with a side of sexy biscuits,  on Southern Fried Homicide. But now, get ready for lust, betrayal and murder,  on Hot Load Case Files. "
"Now let me tell you, child, of a war that is about to come.  Since time unremembered there have been two.  One dark and unforgiving, the other pure and filled with light.  At the dawn of war, I stand alone, looking out at would be the last battlefield, for winter is coming, and I... am a princess.  Once a common lady of the dark army, but, denied my right to be called princess by birth,  I've betrayed my kind,  and now I have chosen my side: that which I believe is best for all,  for it has the dual-shock controller with a speakers and a touchpad interface.  Our land is split in two, brother against brother, friend versus friend,  and my parent will fight on Black Friday as well. for what? I do not know."
"My followers, though few in number, shall help see me through until I am finally accepted as a princess by all. I cannot rest, for I know that even now, the enemy is training for battle, also preparing for winter."
"Adolph Hitler was a very, very naughty man."
"And what happened then? Well, in South Park they say  Johnnie Cochran's heart grew three sizes that day."
"Grinchy Poo went up the chimney and stuffed the tree up
But then he heard a coo, like the cry of a dove
It was little Cindy Lou Poo, who was no more than two
""Mr. Hankey, why? Why are you taking our Christmas tree, why?""
And Old Grinchy Poo thought of a line, and he thought it up quick..."
"And all the poos down in Pooville joined hands and they sang
They sang all the same
And he himself, the Grinchy Poo, carved the roast poo."
But Lambtron's powers also give him a good chance for a new fight. Will he succeed?

They were considered the best comedy act in all of Canada.  But a fast-paced rocket ride to success would bring them to the depths of despair.  This is Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow.
"Terrance was born Terrance Henry Stoot, in the small Canadian village of Toronto.  At a very early age his parents noticed an uncanny musical ability and decided to enroll him in the Canadian School for gifted babies.  It was here that he partnered up with Phillip Niles Argyle , a brash young baby from Montreal.  Together, they performed musical acts that stunned Canadians everywhere.  At the tender age of six, Terrance and Phillip were off to the United States to perform on the Ed Sullivan show . where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time."
"The Canadian act confused American audiences.  But then something happened that would change Terrance and Phillip's act forever.  It was the birth of Canadian comedy.  Terrance and Phillip spent the next several years perfecting their art, and meeting some of America's most influential people."
"But it was in 1974, on the Sonny & Cher Show, that Terrance and Phillip finally started to mix their Canadian humor with deep political insight."
"With this bold mix of humor and political insight, the world couldn't get enough of Terrance and Phillip.  But their fame would come at a price, when Behind the Blow continues."
"As they entered their late teens, Terrance and Phillip were already starting to taste the sweet milk of success.  But the price of fame was looming, as Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues.  The '70s and '80s were a good time for young Terrance and Phillip.  Their act on the Donny and Marie Show earned them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were on the cover of every magazine.  And then in 1998, even a Saturday morning cartoon was made, based on Terrance and Phillip.  Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices."
"The cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether Terrance and Phillip were animated characters or real people. And so, in 1998,  the comedy team started work on what they thought would be their greatest achievement: A made-for-TV movie written by and starring Terrance and Phillip, called ""Not Without My Anus.""  It was their biggest project to date. But it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more popular show, the John Schneider Variety Hour , was supposed to air. When fans tuned in to see John Schneider and instead were treated to the Canadian made-for-TV movie , they were enraged, bewildered, and scared.  The fans revolted and burned down the network, killing six television producers and wounding twelve others.  The hatred of Terrance and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wood polish.  Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old fan and was sued for six million dollars. It was the first time the duo tasted failure , and it nearly killed them both."
"After years of depression and suicide attempts, Terrance and Phillip finally decided to get together  for one last film:  the 1999 hit, Asses of Fire. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the summer.  And though the film also started the Canadian-American War of 1999 , in which eight million people lost their lives, the film was considered a great success.  After almost being executed by the American government , Terrance and Phillip were eventually returned to Canada , where they were touted as heroes.  They have been to hell and back, through the very best and the very worst of times, together, but they had seen it through.  And so ends Terrance and Phillip, Behind the Blow."
"And so, Terrance and Phillip got back together, proving once and for all that fame and fortune are never as important as friendship."
Snacky S'mores presents: The Miracle of Child Birth.  The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking.
"Later, the contractions are happening closer together. Mom sure is in a lot of pain. Now we can see the crown of the baby's head, stretching the vaginal walls in ways never before thought possible by Mom. Finally, the miracle happens, and the baby is born.  but Mom's not done yet."
She still got some afterbirth to push out of her.
That's right.
"The story begins in ages past, in the deep regions of Middle-earth, where Scorn first thrived in the kingdom of Gelgelar."
Seven rings were cast and given to the races of Men.
"Seven, to the races of Elves, five to the gloondock villagers of Gelgendor."
So it was that the heroes traveled many miles to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
The quest continued to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
Looks like them boys are gettin' a little fresh air.
"Well, it looks like the boys are in more trouble than a June bug in molasses. And it's pretty thick molasses, too."
"Way up in the mountains in a small little town,
The Main Street was being decorated all up and down.
People stood in long lines, sometimes waiting hours or more,
Because Christmas needs to be bought in a store.
But out in the forest, not too far away..."
...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas Day.
"The little critters worked hard as they happily sang,
And each one of them had a quite interesting name.
There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit,
Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear.
Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,
Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer.
Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,
and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house.
And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that,
was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat."
"And so, using some paper and working with glee,
the boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree."
The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile...
The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said...
"His friends were all there! What a wonderful surprise!
The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes!"
"""Of course I'll build you a little manger!"" the little boy cried,
and he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side!"
"And out in the woods the boy steamed right ahead,
making a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head,"
"High up in the forest on a dark, craggy peak,
the horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weak.
For the critters to be saved, someone had to stop that nasty old cat..."
Said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
"Killing a mountain lion was no easy task,
But he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast."
"In a flash, it was over! A victorious blow!
The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below."
"The tiny cubs all gathered together and cried,
All alone in the world because their mother had died."
"In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas Eve morn,
The little forest critters prepared for the Antichrist to be born.
The noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years past,
But now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassed.
And meanwhile, three lion cubs were crying away.
For them, there would certainly be no Christmas Day.
And soon the forest would suffer from the offspring Satan begat.
All of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat."
"Now that he'd killed the noble lion queen,
there was nobody to stop the Apocalypse, it seemed."
"""I know!"" he said with a new happy grin,
""I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!"""
"He ran out the living room, turned out the light,
and went back to the forest to set everything right!
But his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did flee... He thought he could hide from his problems - not true!
He knew in his heart the thing he had to do!"
He knew that only by going to the forest could he --
"The boy shook with anger! He broke a sweat and fell ill.
Then he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive on the hill!"
"""Where can they learn that?"" the boy said with a frown.
""I know! The abortion clinic just outside of town."""
"So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed.
And took them to where abortions are performed."
"Yes, he did."
"Yes, he did."
Yes... he...  did!
"Said the boy in the red poofball hat! ""We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!"""
The abortion doctor inquired.
"And so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair base,
And all day watched abortion after abortion take place."
"'Twas the night before Christmas, and above the woods, way up high,
a new bright shiny star hung in the sky.
For the world to be saved there was only one shot,
A little boy with three clubs and an abortion plot."
"He arrived at the critter forest ready to fight,
but then gasped when he saw a most dreadful sight."
"The Antichrist had been born, sealing the world's fate.
The boy in the red poofball hat... was too late."
"When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard,
And a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird!"
"The little boy fretted. He almost started to bawl,
But that's when he came up with the best idea of all."
"The little boy quickly begun,"
"And in the twinkling starlight, each little cub did their portion.
They remembered all they had learned and gave Kyle an abortion."
"And back home, there were presents, and lots of food to get fat.
And it was the best Christmas ever for the boy in the red poofball hat."
"And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later."
