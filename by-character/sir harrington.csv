"You can't sue me.  You're all using my toilet invention the wrong way.  When you have to sit and take a Sir Harrington you're supposed to be facing this way.  So you can use the little shelf for your books, and your quill and your ink."
"Why would I design it so that when you're finished taking a Sir Harrington, you have to stand up, turn around and look right down at your Harrington to flush. That's gross."
Of course! Why do you think I designed toilet rooms with a laundry hole?
