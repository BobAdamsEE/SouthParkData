"Alright men, remember, do not hit the white ones!"
"Hello, boys, how are you?"
"Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere."
"Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at...  Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado!"
Well?
Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel.  They must have some unexplainable bond with it.
"It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B."
Yes.  Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius.
"Ah yes.  Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?"
Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this.
"Hmm...  So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!"
Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!
Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in.
"Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid."
"You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story."
"Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret."
That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
"Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier.  Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know."
"You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down."
Oh yes. It has been all along.
"No, wait.  Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well.  You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all."
"Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished.  Then upload this encryption disk into their computers."
"If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle."
"Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move!  Don't make a move, you bastards!"
Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.
"Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!"
But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar!
"And now you know the horrible truth, boys."
"Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out!  I think I can get it from here, boys!"
"Sorry, Zytar. Didn't your mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings."
