"Looks like you think you're a pretty good skier, huh, kid?"
I've been skiing for twenty-two years. Think you could beat me?
"What's your name, hot shot?"
Stan Marsh  Stan DARSH is more like it.
"Alright, how about a race, then? You and me."
"OooooOOOOooo!  Looks to me like you're not a ""hot shot"" after all."
Oooooooo!
"You may think you've got what it takes, but as long as I'm around, you'll always be number two!  See ya later, Darsh!"
"well well well, if it isn't Stan Darsh!"
"Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take Heather out for some fondue tonight, do ya?"
"I just might show her my moves tonight, if you know what I mean."
"Still don't wanna race me? I told you he was chicken, Heather. Stan Marsh the Darsh!"
"Alright, fine. You and me at the summit, now!"
"Hah! You're going down, little boy!"
"Yeah! Yeeah! Yeah! You lose, Darsh!  Yeah!"
"No hard feelings, right Darsh?!  Yeah!"
Yeah!
"Hey everyone.  I'd like to sing a little song, if I may."
"This is a song I wrote about... Stan Marsh. Staaaaan... Daaaaarsh...Stan. Darsh. Darshy DaaarshStan DaaarshStan Darsh, Stan-darshStan Daaaaarsh DaaarshStan Darsh..."
"A rematch? Oh, Darsh. You're even dumber than I thought."
"Alright then, let's make it interesting. Tomorrow afternoon. On the K-13."
"Hell, I'm not chicken! Are you, Darsh?!"
"Oh, yeah?!"
"Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought... Again! See ya tomorrow."
"This time you're not just gonna lose, you're gonna die!"
Haha.  This should slow down Darsh a bit!
"Now, I'll win for sure!"
"Let's see what some sand does to your speed, Darsh! He doesn't stand a chance, now! I'm gonna beat 'em!"
"Heh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let all these hamsters go. That should distract him just long enough for me to win the race!"
...What are you doing up here?
