Charmed to meet you. Ms...
Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us.
It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air.
"Ms. Garrision, I believe that's a gross over-simplification."
"You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright."
"Well yes, basically, we are."
"Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!"
"Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist."
I never covered it up.
What on earth are you doing??
AAAH!
"Principal Victoria, I really don't think that's necessary. This woman is very opinionated but, she does care about her students."
"Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?"
"Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion."
I've never met a woman with so much... fire
"So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful.  I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I-"
Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?
"Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys."
"You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist."
Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing?
Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?
Really?? Oh that's wonderful!
You're so welcome!
Oh Ms. Garrison!
"You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here."
"So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen."
Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we-
"Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right."
"Yes, but to be so bold about it...  I've just never seen a woman with such... balls."
"Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God."
"Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again."
"Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm."
Oh Ms. Garrison!
"I'll thell them... to call you back... Oh... yeah...  Garrison residence. Can you call... back later, please?"
An emergency?
"I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. Mrs. Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment."
Sex-change operation??
Uuuuugh! You're a man?!
Explain?? How can I be so stupid??
