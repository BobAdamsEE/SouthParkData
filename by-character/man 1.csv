That's right!
They did it! They killed him!
Hey!
Nice.
Hey Randy!
That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!
"Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!"
Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
"The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know!  Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War!  That's when I started suspecting that  my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept.  After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all."
"That's right, yes."
And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!
Right. But we survived.
Poor kid.
Yeah!
Our imagination?
Nobody takes us Canadians seriousleh!
Whaaaaat's haaappeniiiiing?!
All right!
"Wow, that's such cultural music."
"Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak."
He's right.
I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare.
It's pee!
"Here! Hey kid, grab this stick!"
Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.
"Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?"
"Boy I tell you what, it is raining cats and dogs outside. Mostly cats.  I just wish I had brought an umbrella."
"I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals."
It's burning Man!
You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!
"It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good."
Enjoying the show?
No?
"Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is ""blowjob."""
"It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it ""subtext."" Just listen really, really closely."
"Fuck you, bitch!"
This is inhumane.
"Be careful up there, Pete."
The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!
Hello.
They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore!
"Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch."
"Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh  oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh..."
"Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? Dancing with the Stars? The fat transsexual?"
"Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green."
The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?
Raah!
"Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage.  That's very offensive to non-Christians."
"Hey!  Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!"
Change my bet!
Speech! Speech!
Who's next to take a shower?
"You just took one last week, silly."
"Come on, everybody!"
"If we all put our heads together, we can find them!"
Somebody stop it!
"Oh my God, I found a penny!"
I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault!
"Yeah, uh I've done it a few times."
"Oy, look up there!"
"Oh, so this is what it was like."
Yeah.
Counselor Mackey?
I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with  the FBI.
"Duhude, that handicapped dude ruhules!"
"Ooo, free-range aspirin!"
"You mean, during the ball game?"
You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.
Yeah.
I know what I may like. I don't like marching
Do it again!
Oho! Yeah!
That is some weird shit.
Awww.
Huh?
"Come on, Kobe, let's just go."
He's going to speak with us once again!
"Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minnestrone."
"Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons.  Heh, I think it's great."
Oh no!
He is so courageous.
Mary was my mother!
Yes. Yeh-yes she did.
M-mm-m. Not really.
Ms. Lopez! Up here!
"You die, pigs!  You want to die, huh?"
"Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!"
I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus.
"Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?"
This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!
"You're playing into the corporate game! See, the corporations are trying to turn you into little Eichmann's so that they can make money."
"What is your problem? Get lost, little Eichmann."
"Oh man, I can't wait to see the look on those little Eichmann's faces when they hear this crunchy groove."
"Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money!"
"Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety."
More tunes. More tunes!
Let's bail on this whole angry scene.
"We must respect the wishes of people's BFFs. Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces would become meaningless"
That's right! We know whose fault this is!
It's George Bush's fault!
"My name's Bill, and Im an alcoholic."
