"Here we go, Denver! These South Park kids got nothin' on you! Let's go, Denver!"
"Throw the ball to third, you idiots! He's runnin' home!"
"All right, Denver! You're up to bat now!"
"Come on, Denver! Get the lead out! Do not cross the Bat Daaad!"
"Why don't you just go home, South Park? You can't beat Denver!"
You'd better shut your mouth before I shut it for you!
Now for the finishing move! You're about to be Bat-Dadded!
He's done for anyway.
