Yeah. You're right.
"Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-"
"Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this."
But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
"I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric."
"I'm here, Eric."
You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
"Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west."
"That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!"
Bill Clinton.

I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.

From Eric.
"Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9-11."

"Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?"
"Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?"
Yeah...I guess it is...

Oh jeez!
"Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!"
Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
"Who, me?"
No ma'am.
"Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?"
"Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?"
"Well, like what?"
...Die??
Oh hamburgers!!
Eric! Erihic!
He told me to!
Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
"Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!"

But I just did what he told me!
Oh jumping Jesus!
Hello?

"Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?"
But...  but you're here right now.
Huh??
"But, yyou're telling me not to go with you."
"Oh, all right then."
A midget?
Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget!
"All right, Eric, come on, Eric."
"Hey, fellas!"
Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
Yeah Kyle?
Uh what do you mean?
"Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle."
"So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?"
"But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30."
"Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you..."
"Whoa, hey Eric."
A surprise? What is it?
Oh boy!
Y-yeah!
"Oh, okay!"
"How come uh, I can't see?"
"Oh uh, ho yeah."
"Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?"
Well okay!
Whoa! Hey Dad!
I'm getting a surprise!
Hey. Where'd Eric go?
Like what?
What's... bi-curious?
"Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious."
"...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright."
Really?
Whoa boy! Camp!
Because I'm bi-curious?
I'm bi-curious.
He's bi-curious too?
"Well sure, I guess."
"Well yeah, sure."
Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
"Yes, it's all very confusing!"
...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
"Awww, that's okay, Bradley."
"Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!"
Wuh-what's the matter?
"Well I like you too, Bradley."
Well yeah!
"Sure, I like like you a lot a lot."
No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
"I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast."
"Oh no, my Dad?"
"Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'."
"Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?"
"You're perfectly normal, Bradley."
All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
"I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself!"
No. I like bein' bi-curious.
Wait. Now I am confused.
"Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair."
Yeah! Dumb girls!
"Heh hey guys, what would I do?"
"Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice."
Me too.
"Now you go, Baahir."
"Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?"
Well all right!
"Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir."
Oh hey Eric.
"Hey, I was about to win!"
Awwwww.
"But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas."
You have to be careful with scissors.
Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless.
"Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'."
Uh hey Eric!

You... you and your cousin touched wieners?
This is faggot. Go ahead.
"Okay, will do. Faggot out.  Waagh."
"Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!"
Wow.

"Ah, all right then."
"Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us."
"Fellas! Fellas wait!  Hold on, fellas!"
"Don't leave me, fellas! Come back!"
Hey guys!
"Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here??"
"Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry."
Uh what's the Barrier?
"Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?"
Waaahaa!
"Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along."
"Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?"
"Hold on, fellas!"
"Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream."
"Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it."
Huh?
"No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!"
Oh hamburgers!
WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA!
"Please, sir. I have to get home to my world."
Really?
How much further to Castle Sunshine?
What was that?
"Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?"
Wait! Waaait!
"Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters."
"I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-"
Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
"Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key."
"But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off..."
"Wuh, what can I do?"
What powers? Ah I don't understand.
I c-I can?
How?
How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
"AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no!"

GAA HAA!
Santa. Saaanta.
"Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta!"
Huwhoa!
"Stan!  Hey look, I imagined Stan here!"
Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?
"Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key."
More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
Fellas! Where'd you come from?
Huh...
Well I just... used my imagination.
A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
"Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!"
"Ohhh.  Wait, I'm not grounded."
Oh yeah?
Ahhh shit.
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
They're gonna do it!
"Wow wee, look at him go!"
Uh ohhh.
"He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!"
Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!
"Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom!"
They're gonna do it!
"Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party."
Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!
"Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest."
I donno.
I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them.
"You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me."
"Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls."
Neato!
O-kay!
They sure don't.
You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
"Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11!"
"Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!"
Whoopie!
Hey ugly!
"Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face!"
Oh no.
"How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you."
Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
"Great benefit, Eric!"
"Oh, uh-okay, it's clear."
"Okay, but... what are you going to do?"
I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
"I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?"
"Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true."
"Wow, you really know what you're doing."
Man...
"Aw, poor girl."
"Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone."
Hokay.
"Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck!"
Not me! I'm a squirrel!
I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are!
You killed her!
"Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee."
"Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is."
"Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind!"
"There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken."
"Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out."
"Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?"
Yippie!
"Aww, this one again?!"
"Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings."
"Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?"
"I said what what? In the butt

"Yeah, that must be his."
Huh?

Do you see any Indians?
"Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone."
Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!

"We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!"
What are you whoofelin' at?
Whoa!
"Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!"
"No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!"
We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
"Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true."
What?! They called the cops?!
"Oh my God, the police are looking for us!"
We're gonna get it now!
You just got me busted forever!
No!
You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised.
No.
"Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now."
"Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere."
That looks dangerous.
Oh gosh in heaven.
Whoa!
I'm gonna fall!
"I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!"
Huh...
Let's do it!
"Yeah, it sure has."
"Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh..."
Been a hoot all right!
Huh uh.
Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
No!
AAAAH!
"Teacher, my partner is back on the bus!"
Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
"Uhuh, Eric."
"Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent."
The Chinese?
"Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad."
Why are they gonna kill my parents?
I don't want my parents to die.
Well sure.
"Yeah,  fuck 'em."
Well I thought it was pretty good.
"I'm scared, but I know my country needs me."
"But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?"
Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.
"Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese."

"Aw, I did it again?"
"Well okay, I'm sorry!"
They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
"Uh, not exactly."
"Well it's not where I aimed, honest."
I seriously didn't mean it.
"What? Uh where are you going, Eric?"
"By, by my, by myself?"
So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good.
I don't wanna get killed by boobs.
Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
"Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school."
"Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot."
Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her!
Almost time.
Huh.
"Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy."
"But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight."
"That's what I said. I told everyone outside, ""Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"""
That way it won't matter if you get detention.
Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
"Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!"
She chickened out!
She's coming! She's coming!
But Wendy's coming to fight you.
All right!
"Fuck him up, Wendy!"
Well yeah.
"Hello, heh."
We lost?
"Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad."
"Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again."
"Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody."
"Awww jeez, you're no fun."
"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy."
No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in!
"Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem."
There's vampires in the school!
Vampires. I've seen them.
"Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!"
"But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything."
Really? Do you think that's best?
"All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me."
12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.
That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
"Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn..."
"Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!"
"Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!"
"Oh no, what did I do this time?"
Oh Jeez...
"I have no idea, sir."
"Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-"
A well-organized pantry.
"Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-"
Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want.
"Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters."
"O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!"
"Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire."
"Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity."
"Yes! Yes, anything else?"
"Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back."
"I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food."
"Yeah, I guess."
"Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school."
Whoa.
"Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh."
"I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!"
You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable.
"I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se."
"Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter."
"I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!"
"I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna..."
U-huh.  Ow.
What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
Hey Dad.
I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
"Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again."
I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires.
Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
They're putting an end to it!
"Mom, Dad!  I changed back!"
"Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!"
"What's that, Dad?"
Uh oh.
"Ahh, dangit!"
"Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!"
"Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!"
"Um, does Kenny like her?"
"Oh, no. Oh, geez!"
"Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's."
It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
"Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?"
Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
"Uh, what's that?"
Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring?
"Hi, Grandma!"
"Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?"
Well Eric did.
Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
This is gonna be great!
Oh boy!
"Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!"
"They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?"
They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
Robbed us of our innocence...
"Oh God, oh my God no!"
Ohhhhh ohhhhh.
Oh. Hey fellas.
Aw thanks.
Ohhhhh ohhhhh!
"My, my picture?"
"Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde."
Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish!
"Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks?"
"Hey look, Eric killed a dragon."
"Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots!"
We can?
Whoa.
"Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck!"
Yeah!
Neato!
Pirates ho!
Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
"It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it."
"Huh, who, you mean you?"
"No, I'm sick of it!"
"He's right, lads. To adventure!"
Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
"Uhh,  mahjey burazi?"
Oh. He-he says they're in there.
ARRRRRRGH!
Okay!
Have a good day!
"What's ""port""?!"
"One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches."
"Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed."
"Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework."
And our parents hollered at us!
So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
Huh?
"Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?"
"Yeah, me too."
"Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home."
"Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did."
"I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow."
"Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb!"
"Uyeah, I guess I deserve it."
Uugh!
So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
Sellin' kisses?
You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
"Oh boy, I sure am nervous."
"Uh, how come?"
I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
"Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?"
"I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi."
"So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss."
"Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay."
"Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you."
Thank you!
"Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know."
"Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!"
"Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!"
"Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money."
"Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?"
"Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together."
We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
"The next key to a successful business is ""innovation."" I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?"
"Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice."
"I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud."
Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this.
"I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees."
...A pimp. Huh...
"Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. ""The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'"" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally."
"Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company."
"Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp."
"Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job."
What's the game?
Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
I know what you're saying.
Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
Hey Dad!
"Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying?"
"Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today."
"I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?"
"Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo."
Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?
"Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch."
"Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?"
"Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch."
What?
Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
"Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him."
"Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work."
"All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!"
"Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie!"
"Sure, Kyle."
"Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges."
"What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?!"
And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise.
"REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you."
Mmmwhoa boy!
"And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under."
It's a kissing company.
"Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss."
"'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris."
Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
Huh? Why?
But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler.
"Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally."
"Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!"
"Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans."
What's that?
"Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other."
Wha? Awww.
"Oh, oh.  Oh jeez."
"Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!"
Yes! Yehhehehes!
"Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense."
Let's do this!
Triceratops!
"I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir!"
Okey doke.
"Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!"
"Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad."
Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
"That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!"
Yeah!
No way!
I'm freaking out...
Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
"No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!"
"There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!"
Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
Are you sure?
He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
"Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are."
"I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers."
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
"I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! ""Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!"" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!"
It does?
Okay.
"That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom."
"I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious."
Oh jeez!
Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?
That you hate Smurfs?
Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
It is true!
What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
Hey Eric!
"Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?"
"Cool, thanks."
"Oh, okay."
"Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!"
Whoa...
That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
"We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!"
"I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done!"
Let us not forget what happens this day!
"We are here, Wendy Testaburger!"
I am.
The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
"Ohhh, he's got her now!"
She's speechless!
All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
"Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom."
"Okay, thanks."
"You said ""go ahead""."
"Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do."
You bet!
The who?
Whoopie!
"Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!"
"Come on, Kyle!"
"Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner!"
Do you need to wash your hands?
"You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle."
"Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee."
"Please, Kyle, I wanna go home."
"You can do it, Kyle!"
Hey look!
"Hawww, you lived?"
What's this?
"Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy."
I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
"Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!"
Oh no!
It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
"There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right.."
But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
"No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine."
Haah! Leave me alone!
"Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush."
"I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?"
"Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore."
"Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips."
"Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?"
Aww. Dangit.
Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
I am?
Oh no. Which book was that?
I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
"Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did."
Huh?
"Oh, thanks."
I wrote that.
Thank you!
That's nice.
"Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?"
"But, you told me I did!"
"Yeah, I'm broooding."
"No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!"
I have to come right to my room after school.
"Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly."
"Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so."
"Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan."
"Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit."
"Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!"
"Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!"
"Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation."
I know.
You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
"Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this."
What?
What?! Oh no!
"Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly."
"Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?"
"How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?"
"Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!"
"The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house."
I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!
"Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!"
"Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here."
"Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways."
"You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?"
Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
"He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please."
You will?
Hey Eric.
Ahhh well oh- kay.
"Eeyeah, I'm psyched."
I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
NASCA- NASCAR?
You're givin' away all your money??
You sure you want to do this?
Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy!
Hey Eric.
Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
Feel stupid yet?
All those ladies have stinky vaginas?
"Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings."
Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?
"But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil."
"No, you're good."
Really?
That was fast.
"Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped."
"Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her."
"Eric, are you sure you can do this?"
I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
Eric?
"Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be."
Eric! Don't ever talk like that!
"How bad is it, doctor?"
Well at least there's that.
"Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid."
"It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?"
"You seemed really stupid, Eric."
Obama's fuckin' gay.
Pissin' me off!
"Yeah, he's a champion alright."
"Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side."
That's fuckin' gay as hell.
There you go. You're back on the track.
"Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell?"
I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
Huh?
"Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy-"
But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
Are you being serious?
"Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die."
Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.
"Hey Stan, I have a note for you."
"Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman."
You didn't read them?
"Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?"
"""You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."""
"Hold up. Here it is right here: ""by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"""
"""Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract."" Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... ""Decline."""
The Geniuses...
We know. It's preposterous.
The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
Not again.
"Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it."
Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
"And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him."
Skeletor is real??
Skeletor's a lady??
Hey Eric.
Is that really all our wiener sizes?
"Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?"
A conspiracy?
"Whoa, it's a little chilly in here."
"Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?"
"Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?"
I'm hung like a horse!
"Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis!"
"I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr!"
"Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!"
Wuuuuhhhhhh!
Every single night.
"I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now"
Slash is make-believe??
Well what the heck do we do now?
I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you.
An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
"You can count on Postman Butters!  Special delivery, ma'am.  Here you are, sir.  Brand new sushi restaurant in town.  A flyer for you, from Postman Butters!"
"Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you."
It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
"Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers."
Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.
"But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-"
"Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!"
"It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom."
Oh hey Dad.
"I love you too, Dad."
Sure.
"Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver."
Sure.
"Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun."
"Uh, well, to solve mysteries."
"Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!"
What? Why would I do that?
"Me, Butters."
"Sir, I'm confused."
Really?
Pardon me?
Yes!
"This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping."
"Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal."
"Well goodnight for now.  Goodnight, Butters."
"Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus?"
Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again!
"Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!"
"Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?"
"Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face."
Huh?
"Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-"
This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!
"I'm trying, sir!"
What?
"But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh..."
"That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh!"
"Um, excuse me?"
Wahh!
"Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you."
What??
No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
"It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this."
"Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!"
Hah?
Aw man.
"Oh, come on!"
AAAAAAAAAAA!  AAAAAAAAAAA!
Waaaa!
Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one!
I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
"Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more."
"Hey Kyle, you have a visitor."
"Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!"
"Oh what, I'm not a good Meheecan?"
"Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: ""Go that way."" How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans."
"Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border!  Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work."
"Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting."
"I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans."
"Work, Mexican, Work.  Work, Mexican, Work"
Wow! A present just for me?
"Ah, sí señor."
"All week long, bossman say"
"Sing your Song, earn your pay"
Meheecan
"Meheecan, it's your"
While people play in the sun all day
"Hey, where are you going?"
"Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?"
"So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla!"
"Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!"
Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
"All my amigos are there, waitin' for me."
Viva la Meheeco!
We're crossin' the border!
Olé!
"Oh uh, I'm sorry,  I don't really-"
Wow.
"Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick."
...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
Game on!
AAAH!

Giddy up!
Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee!

"So then, so then the fireman says ""That won't even fit in my scrotum!""  Yeah!"
"Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!"
Eavesdropper?

Biggest story about who?
There he is!  It's Lemmiwinks!
"Hang on, Lemmiwinks!"
Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him!
"Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon."
"Uh but, then, why does his face look like that?"
"Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club."
"Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair."
"Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is."
I sure hope this works.
"Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?"
"Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?"
"Oh neato, huh fellas?"
Thanksgiving is about murder?
Okay Dad.
"Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch."
So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
"Well actually, Eric, it's you."
"Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal."
"Uh, I won't tell anybody."
"Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing."
My grandma is from Virginia.
A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
Whoops!
Sorry. My arms hurt.
"We aren't makin' that much, fellas."
"Oh sorry, sorry."
Sorry!
"Equipment is flying in, ten seconds."
We got it. We got it!
What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
"Well, count me out."
"Well, I'm scared."
"Oh, that's okay. I think..."
HA?!
Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
"You mean it's like, like a monster?"
AAAAAAHHH!
"Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways."
AAAAAHHH!
"No, it's a school night!"
You think Jewpacabra is here?
Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
"Oh God, I'm scared."
"Eric, stop it!"
I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
Jesus is a lie?
Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
"Oh, hamburgers."
"It's all quiet out front, Eric."
He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes.
"Hey, Eric."
"Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet."
"Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide."
"Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen!"
"Heh, h-hey fellas."
"OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways."
...Yeah.
"Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale."
"Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy."
"Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin."
My Grandma?
"Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?"
Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?
"I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma."
"Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma."
"No, you took it all!"
My grandma??
Oh hamburgers!
HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma.
"Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me."
"Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it!"
Yes...
"Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind."
"Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this."
"Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me."
Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy.
"Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow."
HAAAAA!
"We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me!"
"Oh uh, nothin'."
Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
"Please, leave me alone."
No it doesn't.
Stop it!
"Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma."
"Fellas! Fellas! Fellas!  AAAAH, Fellas!"
Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!
Guess!
There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
"Theh theh, there she is."
How come?
"Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other."
"Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room."
"It's gonna be okay, Eric."
They'll find love somewhere else.
"Yes, they will."
"In...in who, Eric?"
"Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it."
"That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking."
"I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?"
"Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!"
"Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!"
"This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!"
"Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!"
"And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say ""Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!"" And then you give them a smile!"
"And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!"
Huh?
"Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas."
"Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything."
'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes.
"I love you too, ladies."
Woohoohoohoohoo!
Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out.
"I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!"
"Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later."
"Wuh sure, Eric."
"Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player."
"Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?"
"...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings."
"My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it."
I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way.
Do you feel warm and compassionate?
"All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss."
"Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?"
"Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go."
Like me!
"42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid!"
"Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along."
What's sarcasm and what's com?
DAD! Hey Dad!
My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
"Thanks, Dad."
Leave me alone!
"Get out of here, all of ya!"
"You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts!"
And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time!
Double wow!
"I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!"
"I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!"
"Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud!"
It's not?!
Yeah?
"Hey yeah, all the time."
Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
Uhbu-but I'm from here.
We're from Hawaii?
But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
"They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this!"
"I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just ""deligerent"" because of my hapanuanalua!"
Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
"Well, we're here, now what do I do?"
"Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?"
"Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian."
Yeah?
"Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny."
"Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come."
You folks are all native Hawaiians too?
"What's ""saimin""?"
"Whoa, it's like gasoline!"
"Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better."
I've never done this before.
Aim... my anger! Stupid  Ben Affleck!  Waaah!
"No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!"
"He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!"
"Kenny, be careful!"
Kenny!
"Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!"
"Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!"
Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!
"Surrender?! No, the heck with that!"
"Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!"
"No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!"
"Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez."
"What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better."
"Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!"
Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
"I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style."
Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
"That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!"
"Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash."
Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying.
"Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, ""Well, what about the New Testament?"""
"And he says, ""Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."""
"Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?"
"Stand ground, Mr. Mackey!"
Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus.
I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here.
He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
Who?
"Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!"
Go Stan!
"...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!"
Prostitute!
"Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers."
Yeeah. Is it true?
"Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole."
Wu-what sound?
"Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason."
"Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?"
"He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!"
I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
"It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone."
Well... hah... HWAAAH!
Ah! Bah! I hate almonds.
What's up fellas?
"Bleh, ogayedmi."
AGH! No! Please! You can't!
Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.
At Red Robster.
Red Lobster!
Red Lobster!
Red Lobster!
I didn't say anything. I promise.
"Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!"
Ww-ww-what's the N S A?
The government watches everything we do?
"Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. "
"Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. "
"Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, ""If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness."" Are these people nice?"
"Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was ""Pink"" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! ""Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!""  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang ""My Country Tis Of Thee"" 100 times! And I watches ""America's Got Talent"" twice! What else can I do?"
"Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!

Ow! I said Ow ow!"
"Sure, I love the Truth."
Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.
Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
"Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?"
Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
"Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! "
"Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?"
We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
"You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?"
"Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?"
Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
"Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart."
"Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that."
"Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?"
I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
"It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart."
It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
"Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes."
Yes.
Yes!
That's right.
"We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!"
Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
Hallelujah!
Murder porn?
"I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!"
"I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled ""Hey, watch out for the Creepers!"" but she fell!"
Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
Huh?
Yes.
Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!
Holy Moly.
"Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token?"
"Heheh, yeah. "
"Whoa, look at it!"
"Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake."
Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too!
"Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?"
Busted!
"Just stop, please."
"Woo, spooky."
"Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! "
"Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet."
"Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones."
"Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?"
"Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?"
"Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all."
"Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. "
I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
Yeah!
"You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?"
They don't!
"Yeah, I finished it!"
"Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!"
Wha-what do you want me to do?
Who's George R. R. Martin?
"Well come on, Scott. You're lagging."
"Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. "
Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
"Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?"
We're not fans!
"We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!"
"Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! "
"Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up."
When?
Please. It's urgent.
"No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?"
"Uh what's the matter, Scott?"
He's diabetic.
"Oh. Okay, thanks."
"OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!"
But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
"Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!"
What kind do we want?!
"Come on, Scott! We're leaving! "
"NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!"
Whatoyou mean?
Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
What's that?  Awww! 
"Hey, fellas. What did I miss? "
The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
"Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!"
"So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says ""I""-"
Oh. Yes?
"Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me."
"See ya, Lisa! "
"Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-"
Oh. Hey Wendy.
Am I just an asshole?
"Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything."
Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
"I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything."
You're a liar!
"You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!"
"Oh, she said it again!"
"Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!"
"Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! "
Okay.
That's Lisa Berger?
She's pretty!
Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
"And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. "
"Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?"
"II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever."
What?! Well since when?
No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
I do love water balloons. 
What's a PewDiePie do?
Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
It's true!
Heheyehah.
Rotten boobie turds!
Man this sucks!
"Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken."
We already got a dollar!
One dollar pledge!
Another two dollars!
Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.
Oh no!
"Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here."
Happy Deadline Day!
"Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!"
It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
Somebody killed Kickstarter!
"Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!"
We finally did it!
Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.
I think someone's in there.
That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.
"He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me."
Holy moly!
"Hey! Everything okay, Stan?"
Just hold it. That's what I do now.
"Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!"
Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!
Hey! Where do you think you're going?!
"Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy!"
"Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo."
"Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took."
"I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato."
My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
You can see the momma bird fly in.
We took all kinds of video with his drone.
"You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff."
It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
My dad said it's not for spying on people.
Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
"No, Eric. I don't wanna d-"
Comin' dad! 
"Yes, it's me."
Of course not!
What?! You said nobody would know!
Be careful! The powerlines!
"Okay, uh maybe that's enough. "
Let me see!
Jeeeeezz!
What do I do?!
I don't know what to do!
"Oh, heh-hey dad."
"Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?"
"I love you too, Dad. "
What the heck are you doing?!
When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
WHY?!
I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
"Why would you turn ""Craig's mom's bush"" into a music video starring us?!"
Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
Why?!
That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
"I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!"
I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
You do?
What?
NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
...Okay.
"If this doesn't work, we're dead."
Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
"Congratulations, Kyle."
"Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. "
We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
"WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it."
I feel Stan! He looks totally real!
More of the school. 
The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
"Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- "
What what what?
"Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!"
I'm sorry!
Yeah.
Oh Jesus! 
"Okay, I'm back in your room!"
Suppornity window dropped. 
Wow! That was cool!
I touched Wendy's boobs.
Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
"You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said ""Well, technically I was in school."" Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?"
Yeah. 
"Well, not a hundred percent..."
"Okay, subject is ready."
Interim status is go.
It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
Going now! 
Okay.
How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
"Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it."
There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
"Okay, I got it!"
Already? Oh no!
"I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. "
"Hello Dad! It's me, Butters!"
This is for all the times I got grounded! 
"HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!"
"Huh, that was incredible!"
"I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! "
Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
"Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now"
"Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here."
I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
"Take that, you dumb hooker!"
I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
"I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!"
I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
Aw nuts!
I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
Ahhh!
Eric! Uh what are you doing here?
What?
Nuh uh!
WHAT?? 
"Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!"
Ah how do you know that?!
Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!
NO!
AAAAAAHAHAH! 
Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
...What? What do you mean?
I don't know what you mean.
"Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!"
"Oh really? Oh, that's a relief."
Oh gosh!
OH GOSH!
Yeah.
"Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!"
"No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!"
"I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!"
PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- 
"I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. "
Huh. But...  you guys can't be here.
Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
"When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life."
YES.
AAaaghagh!
Huh I'm sorry Dad!
"Ahhh, huh?"
"You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?"
They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!
"Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore."
Oh no! Kenny!
But he's dying!
"Dangit, I wish I knew people."
Yeah.
"Wow, the cops came?"
"Hmmm, it's kind of gay."
"I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?"
"Well, gay is wholesome."
"Me, too!"
Pass this up.
"Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however."
"Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think."
"Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh?  They got those thick noses and all."
Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be.
"Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels."
"No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it."
"Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?"
"Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley."
"Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it."
"Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels!"
"Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown."
Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
"So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?"
"Well, hooray!"
"Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', ""Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?"" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was."
Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
"Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?"
"Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?"
"Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya!"
Whoa!
"Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families."
"How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?"
"Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-"
"Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on."
"Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?"
Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.
"Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Waaah!  Gooh."
"Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?"
"Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir."
"Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!"
"Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya."
"Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?"
"Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench."
Got it.
"Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!"
"Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape."
"Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess."
"Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister?"
Woo-oh Holy Cow!
Yeah. He's a badass!
"Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too."
"Eh, he said he'd hang out with me!"
"Well, she sure is."
"Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield."
"Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not?"
"Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch."
"Oh. O-oh, okay."
Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?

"Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!"
"...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid."
"Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!"
"Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was."
"Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-"

Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
"Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth."
"Well, uh, see ya, fellas."
What the-?  Who's there? Who is that?!
"Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see?"
"Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat."
"Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!"
"Well, uh I sure am, I guess."
"Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose."
"Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?"
"Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess."
Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
Well uuh-uuh-alright then.
"Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team."
"Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'?"
"Ho, I don't wanna!"
"Oh, uhuh alright, then. 
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, ""Get well soon!""
And ""Please don't die on us."""
Can I go now?
"Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot."
"Huh, where are we goin'?"
"Oh well, we're busted."
I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.

Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
"Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?"
"No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!"
Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
He had sins that he didn't confess!
"Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open."
He had sins that he didn't confess!
Huh-Hallelujah!
Jesus!
"Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too."
"Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?"
"Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl."
"Huhuh, look at all this stuff."
Huh-it sure was.
Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.

Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
Uhh rrreeally are you sure?
"Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is."
"I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper."
Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?

"Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say ""shit"" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way."
"Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, ""Oh, shit,"" or, ""shit on a shingle""?"
"Hey, fellas!"
"Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody."
"Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!"
"Oh, well, here he is."
We can't tell you.
"Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no!"
"Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?"
"Uh yeah, ah I think so."
Me neither.
"Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?"
I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
"I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here."
"Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle."
Wuh what are you gonna do?

"Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas."
"Uh what are we gonna do, huh?"
Ha-I'll be nine next week.
"Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?"
"Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  ""If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"""
"How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey."
Ha-a how come I gotta go first?
"Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky."
"I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see."
But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
"Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on."
...Pretty good.
"Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it."
"Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?"
Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
"Uh, hey!  How's it goin', fellas?"
"Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?"
"What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?"
Stop breathin'?
"Well. Alright, then."
"Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures."
Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.
"But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute!"
"Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!"
I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
"My mom?  Oh, sweet Jesus!"
W-what?
"Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture."
"Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened."
No! That's just what I look like. See?
"I'm not makin' a face, mom!"
Another week?  I hate my stupid face.
Hehyeah?
"Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems."
"Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me."
"I sure am, Dad!"
"Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-"
"Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-"

"Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C!"
Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich?
They sure do.
"Heh yeah, later, puss."
"Hehehey, fellas! Ah, hey fellas!"
Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
"Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this."
"Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah."
"Oh, it's all sticky."
"Uh, yeah?"
"Eh, just about."
"Oh. Well, uh okay."
"Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls."
"Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya."
"It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty."
"Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs!"
"Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!"
That's me.
That's me.
"Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. ."
Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
Yes sir!
We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.
Dad's a good shopper all right.
"You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?"
Sure I do!
"Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am!"
"Uh, that's me!"
Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
"""White Swallow Bath House"""
"Uh, that's me!"
"I'm back, Ma!"
I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.
"Well first, he went to see a movie."
"I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open."
"""Fisting Firemen 9""  I've never seen 1 through 8."
"Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him."
To the gym.
Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.
"Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!"
"Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice ""trip,"" Mom? See you next ""fall."" Hahaha, yo- Ma?"
"Uh, that's me!"
Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.
"Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?"
"Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him."
That's me!
One please.
Uh thanks!
"Dad?  Dad, you in here?"
Hello? Eh-anybody in here?
"Uh, Mr. Garrison?"
Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?
"Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm."
Hi Dad!
"I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?"
"Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home."
That's me!
"Uh, hey Dad."
"Well, sure thing, Dad."
"Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so."
Little white lies?
"...Uh, who's Jack?"
"Oh no, that won't happen, Dad."
"Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine."
"A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?"
"Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!"
"Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along."
"Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too."
"Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' ""nutsack"" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself."
"Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here."
"Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water."
"Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom!"
That's me!
"Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?"
That's me!
That's me!
"And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' ""you took my rubber bands."" Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister."
"Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk?  He must like TGI Fridays."
"Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this?"
"Uh, is this the Stotch residence?"

Sir? Hello?
"Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar."
I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road?
"...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em."

"Oh.  Alright, then. I-"
"Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-"
"I ain't grounded, am I?"
Lie?
"Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary."
"Uh stop it, Mom and Dad."
"Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two!"
"Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?"
"...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?"
Yeah!
Yeah!
"Ye-!  wait, what?"
"Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!"
"Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now."
"I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay."
"Naw, I'm lyin'"
"Wuh comin', Dad!"
That's me!
"Uh, hey, fellas."
"Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!"
"Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!"
"Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!"
Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now.
"Wow, Jared!"
Me?!
"Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one."
"But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me."
You mean like Jared?
Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
Wow.
"Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!"
"Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?"
"Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more."
Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
No!
"W-well, k-kinda like Cartman.  Aw!"
"Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat."
Well alright then.
Hey fellas.
"Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it."
Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
"Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know..."
"Uh, I don't know about this, fellas."
Woahhh!
"Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy."
Waaaahh!

Everything's getting dark...
"Whoa, everything's getting sparkly."
Mom. Dad.
Yes sir.
"Four times, mom."
"Yes, sir."
Uh- go where?
"I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery."
"Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days."
"Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!"
"Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!"
No- but you don't sound like me.
"Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded!"
"Huh. Huh, uh, uh."
Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
"Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?"
Hu-oh! Goody!
Uh- perfect.
"Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal."
"Hi, Mom and Dad!"
Ow! Dad?

"Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?"
"Hey, do you guys smell that?"
"Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo."
"Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo."
So where's the part where we have a good time?
"Wuh, that's my face, sir."
"Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?"
Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh go Stan!
"U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you."
Let's dance.
"Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?"
"Come on, Stan!"
"Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead."
"And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither!  I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!"
"Oh, all right, then."
"Oh, that'd be awesome!"
Cool!
"Uh, it sure is!"
"Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?"
"Uh, but that's me. I'm Butters."
"We-ell hold on a second, you guys."
Hang on now.
Wait! W-why does it have to be me??

"I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh."
...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.

"Oh, Jesus, see me through this."
"Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose."
"Uhhh, yeah."
"They sure do. They always say to me, ""Butters, you're not Kenny."" But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-"
"I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it."
Uh what condition?
"I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that."

"Well yeah, I s'psoe"
"Uh, sure."
Oh really?
"Oh I'm sorry, mom."
"Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again."
Yes ma'am.
"Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself?"
Oh Jesus! They were??

Oh I know.
"Huh, me neither."
"Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the ""Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."""
"Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: ""Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."""
Huuh what's the matter?
No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.

"I told you, we can't go to my house!"
"Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on!"
"Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh..."
Oh Jesus! Wait.
I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them.
I'm sure! There's no way!
"Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter."
No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
They have to show it! They promised they would!
"Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it!"
Yeah.
How far away is June?
"Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go."
"Wuh well, sure."
Wull what is it?
"Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend."
Not working out?
"Well, but ah I can get better."
Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
"Please, fellas, uh don't fire me."
"The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow!"
"Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos!"
"Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins."
"I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me!"
Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos!
"Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning!"
"It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's."
"Yeh, you didn't?"
"Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?"
"Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch!"
"Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer!"
"So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!"
"Ms. Choksondik,"
"Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad."
"Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be."
"The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools!"
"I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand!"
"Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there."
"Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail."
"It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!"
A note?
"Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!"
"Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos."
"Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions."
Join me?
But why?
"Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red."
"Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray."
"Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find 'em..."
"People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!"
"Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch!"
"Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray?"
"Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time."
"Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete."
"Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that?"
"Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!"
"Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!"
"This is, General Disarray. My final solution."
"Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray."
"Hey, fellas."
How are things... oing with your new best friend?
"Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters."
"Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas."
"Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me!"
"Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray."
"Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity."
"Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!"
"Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow."
"Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be!"
Huh?
"He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original."
"Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?"
"General Disarray, are your parents home?"
"Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date."
"You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!"
"Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news!"
Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
"I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!"
"Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch."
Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
Stupid Simpsons...
"Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?"
"Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-"
I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus!
Dwaah!!
"I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?"
Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
"Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be."
No! No!
Aaaaah!
Oh sweet Jesus!
"Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!"
Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on!
Haaah!
Aaah! Nooo!

Cartman?
Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!
"They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!"
"Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again."
I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again!
Compassionate.
"You mean, like a goldfish?"
"Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh?"
"Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me."
Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
Uh here comes an SUV.

Stupider than Bebe!
"Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?"
Yeah!
Uhyep.

"Wha-wha, what are you doing?!"

W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator.
It evaporates.
Sure.
Lemmiwinks? NO!
But they killed Lemmiwinks!
Yes sir.
No more... arts and crafts...
"Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?"
"Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success."
"I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too."
"I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid."
Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
Nobody asked.
Probably watching Becker.
"See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-"
"Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan?"
"Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?"
"Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then."
I don't follow.
Oh! Are we out for an adventure?
"I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else."
"Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan?"
"Yeah, I can't believe it!"
"This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject."
"Eh, but then why did they come back to the past"
Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'
"Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!"
"You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!"
"Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret!"
"Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see."
Now you know my terrible secret!
"Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan."
"Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver."
How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
"Wow, look at this, Stan.  ""Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."""
"Hey look, somebody lost their pet."
"Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks."
This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
"Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too."
"Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them."
You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
Yeah!
Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.
Poop- poop swatches?
"Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?"
"Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best."
Well that sounds good.
Hooray!
Wow! Neato!
"Boy, it sure is stinky in here!"
"Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-"
"Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?"
Uh but Cartman! Wait!  Oh Christmas!
"Oh, Stan!"
"Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden."
We are?
"Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now"
"Oh, not really sir, I just uh..."
Hey Jimmy.
"Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him."
"You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman."
"Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show."
"Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh?"
I love our class!
"Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streible's house got covered with toilet paper."
I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
Ha-ey fellas.
Hey fellas!
Yep. I'm in jail.
"Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!"
"Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!"
"Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!"
"You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too."
"Hi, Dad."
Yeah.
"Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol."
"Officer, can I stay in jail, please?"
"Mmuh well, not really, no."
"Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!"
"Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez!"
"Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too!"
"Ah, I was at home."
Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
How do I do that?
Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
I'm not playing. I really don't know!
No!
My weiner??
"Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening."

"Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out."
Okay.  Ow. Ooww!
Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
"Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out."
"How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?"
"Yeah, ahh, that's right!"
"Hey, I know! How about a dog parade?"
"Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!"
"Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads."
Oh...
"Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classies."
"Oh, hi Eric."
...Ohhh!
"Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration."

Well done!
Ow...
"Wow, neato! An album cover!"
Cheese!
Cheese!
Oh...
"Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are."
"Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out."
Heeheeheeyeah.
"Uhm, oh."
"Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus."
"Fuck you, Eric."
"Wow, that's gonna be so fun!"
"What's this all about, Eric?"
"Well, sure I can!"
Nnn-how terrible?
What??
I just see stars.
"Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!"
It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
When do you think uh it'll get here?
What??
"Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!"
Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??
AAAAHH!
Oh Jeez!
Oh God! Oh Jesus!
"But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too."
Are you sure?
But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
"Oh God, oh God!"
"""Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square...""  Hello?  Hello??"
Hwaaaah!!
"Wuh, wait, well, what happened??"
What about my parents. Did you see them?
"Oh my God, let me see!"
How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
"Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me."
"But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?"
Who's coming this way?
Oh God! I hate cannibals!
Noooo!
But I can't see nothin'.
Are we out in the destruction?
Aw man.
"Huh... Oh, it's terrible."
Whoa!
Whaaat??
AAAAHH!
Waaaaaah!
Ooohhhh!
"Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!"
Oh no!
Uh w-where??
Aren't you coming?
"Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you."
"Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky."
"You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan..."
HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?
"You're not a cannibal, are you?"
"Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!"
"I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are."
"Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!"
"Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?"
"He's a peckerface, that's what he is!"
"Let him have it, Stan!"
"Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!"
"We came over to cheer you up, Stan!"
Well what do we do now?
What's Raisins?
This place is awesome!
Whoa!
W-we are.
"You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?"
"Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go."
When do you wanna see me?
"Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars."
Waa... ahaaah...
She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
Lexus!
I waited all night for you to get off work.
I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
"Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present."
It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit.
"Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime."
O-kay!
"Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life relationship."
Hi! Is Lexus here?
Darling!
Oh God. I missed you so much.
"Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend."
Hey Lexus.
"Wuh it's me, Butters."
"I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?"
"Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD."
"Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times."
"Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money"
"Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God."
"Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again."
Uh but I spent it all.
On my girlfriend.
Yeah.
Yup!
"Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you."
Okay.
"Here we are, Mom and Dad!"
"Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her."
"Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus!"
Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.
Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
Huh?
"Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!"
"... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?"
So that's it? We're broken up now?
Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
"Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan."
"Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me."
Yeah.  It sure does hurt.
"Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life."
"Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid..."
"Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan."
Hey fellas. What's happenin'?
"Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?"
"I think I'd make a really good ninja.  Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time."
I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
"Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas!"
"Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while."
"Well, o- okay Mom.  Bah! Gah!"
Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
Nuh uh!
Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
"Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs!"
Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
It hurts! It hurts!
But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital!
Ah.  Hwa!  Hwaaaaa!
You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital!
"Whoa, I'm getting woozy."
"But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded."
"Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy."
"Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff."
"Wuhuff, woof, woof."
"bu- but fellas, I gotta-"
"Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.  Eh. Woof, eh. Woof."
Woof woof.
Woof woof.
Gaaaah!
"Haba, haba! Habahoaha!"
"Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-"
"Oh well, hi there everybody."
"Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?"
...No.
"No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!"
Waaaaah!
Aaaaah!  Aaaaah!
Two years ago. Two years ago!
Whoops.
Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!  No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!
What do you want?
"Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.  I gave that up."
Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
"Yeah well, you tell that to their families."
"I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!"
What?
Aaaah!
"Get out of my room, Stan."
Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
"Waaah!  No! Jesus, not again!"
No! No! Noooooo!
"What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  ""To Butters Stotch.""  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? ""Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa.""  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package."
Whoa...
You... you're my robot?
Oh wow!
"Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have."
"Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter."
"Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?"
"Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum."
"Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff."
"Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days."
"Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me."
"No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again!"
"Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!"
"When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake."
Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
"Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!"
"Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?"
How come?
"Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you."
"Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend."
That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
"Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime."
"Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?"
"Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away!"
"I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!"
Oh. Yeah.
"Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?"
Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
"Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there."
"AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you."
"Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep."
"All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo..."
"Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have."
AWESOM-O?!
"AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?"
"Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!"
"Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast."
"Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight."
"Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O."
"Who's at the door, AWESOM-O?"
"Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot."
Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party.
"He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?"
He's made in Japan!
"AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop!"
Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
"Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever!"
Hi Aunt Nellie!
"It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!"
"Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in."
"There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie."
"Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat."
AWESOM-O?
"Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!"
"I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind- That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.

"Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!"
"Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh?"

"Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice."
"Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either."

"AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"

AWESOM-O!
"No!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world!"
"Hey, robots don't fart!"

"No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through."
"Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-"

"Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse."
Will do.
"Boy, that was a great episode!"
Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
"Well, what are we waitin' for?!"
"Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing."
Lie about celebrities.

Stupid news hair!
"Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?"
I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.
"Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says ""Well that's gonna add another hour to his time.""  Yeah! You guys!  Heh."
"So Dagwood says ""Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house."""
"Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em."
Woo. We aren't havin' a party.
"Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey."
"Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas."
Hey! Let's run naked through the street!

"Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!"
"Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll keep my eyes open."
"Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too."

My name's Butters.
"Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, ""never get into a car with a stranger."""
"Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right."
"Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this."
I'm sorry.
"Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton."
"Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw."
Oh hamburgers!
"Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her!"
"Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??"
Y-yes sir!  I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.
"Well, no, not quite."
"Ah, shucks!"

Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
"Wuh be careful, Kyle."
"Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean."
"Well but, but what happened?"
"Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end."
"Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!"
"Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro!"
"Ah I will, Mom."

Son of a biscuit!
"Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-"
Hey Eric!
"Huh I just said, ""Hey Eric!"""
"Well, sure I can see you."
"Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?"
You died?? How??
"But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?"
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
Me! I saw a ghost!
But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
"Ruh, really?"
So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
Huh s-s-super-AIDS?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
"Y yes, yes sir."

Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
Oh.
I can't. Ahah I have school tomorrow.
"Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!"
Mrs. Cartman?
"This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something."
"He says, he love you."
He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
"He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted."
"Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times."
He can't! Don't you understand?!
"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!"
Uhh alright then.
"Aww, that's okay, Eric."
So I won't see you again?
Wow.
Yeh you're still here.
"Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough."
"Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did."
Did you ever do anything really bad?
Broke fence...
"Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for."
"Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this."
Does this mean... you have to go now?
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God!
Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
"Lu lu lu, lu lu lu"
So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.
Ahhh.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore."
"Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event."
Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!
"Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?"
"Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane."
"Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!"
Really?
"Well, he's sittin' next to me right now."
"Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost."
"Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me."
"Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal."
"Hurry. Go, go!"
"Boy, we sure did."
Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.
"I'll miss you too, ghost pal."
Huh?
Huh but I thought you were one!
Oh hamburgers.
"Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always."
"Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!"
"Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu."
"Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show."
"Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem."
Well sure I do.
"Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her ""vagiiina.""  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady."
"That's right, Jimmy."
"Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo!"
"Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton!"
How do you know?
Okay. I'm not lookin'.

Oh... Thank you.
"Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night."
Oh...
"Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places."
"I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?"
Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?
Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
How about we read each other's future?
"Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out?"
AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches!
"Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?"
Nobody likes meee...
You don't know how hard it is to be me.
You think I'm ugly-ehehee...
You said I'm ugly and flat.
You mean it?
My mom?  Hello?
"Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends."
"Well, I'm workin' on it."
"Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom."
"Ah. Uhh, could I hold that?"
How?
"Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do!"
"No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead!"
Hello?
"Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back."
"Hey Mom and Dad, I'm not-"
"Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me."
Hi Dad.
"Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?"
"Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry."
"Uh hello, I'm Butters."
Huh?
Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's?
Ho! Daywalkers!
"That was a very informative speech, Kyle."
Well okay! Let's do it!

Oh hamburgers! What is that??
"Oh, now we're gonna get it."

"Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up."
