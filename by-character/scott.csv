They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.
What's so bad about hanging out with me?
"Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!"
"Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack."
"'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-"
Hey guys. Hey guys!
The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.
"No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does."
She'll kiss anybody?
Wow.  It's almost like having someone care about you.
You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!
"No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!"
Why would I take the princess of Canada?
I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!
"What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!"
The Native Canadians.
There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.
Fart-loving eskimos! I'm sure they've taken the princess! Just look at them! Loudmouthed self-centered assholes!
"Let's get 'em! Let's fuck them up!  What? You're looking at me like I'm some sort of Eskimo racist! Well I'm not! Think about it! Before the noble white man arrived, Canada was populated with these snow monkeys! Who else would be pissed off enough at Canada to kidnap our royalty?!  Oh shit!"
"This is stupid! I'm tellin' you you're making a mistake, kid!"
"Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours!"
Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!
"Oh, so now I'm a dick!"
It's the princess!
There!
"Who took you, Princess?!"
Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!
Fart-loving tooth decay! I'll fix you!
"What the?  You did it, kid!"
En garde! 
Aaah God ow sorry...
Ah!
I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
"Yeah, we don't like it!"
"Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint."
I told you I have to eat every two hours.
AAAH! 
"If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out."
Ehhh...
Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more!
Jeaaaaah!
He hasn't even ordered the pizzas yet!
I actually have plans this weekend.
"That is correct, yes, I do."
Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?
"Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer.  That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance!"
"All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,  a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.
""Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in
with my new hammer""
Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God! J'accuse, Terrance!"
"Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court! They think that farts are funny, but they're not!"
Goddammit. That isn't funny!
"Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!"
There are hard feelings! This isn't over! I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done! And do you know why??
"No! Because I hate you! You think farting is sooo funny! Well it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--  Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer!"
Yes! In the head!
"This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip. You'll rue this day!"
Hello?
"Yess, yes it is."
Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.
"Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!"
Who is this?
Saddam Hussein?! The Iraqi dictator?
What do you want?
I'm not sure I should trust you.
"Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon."
The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.
Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
"Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out.  I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers."
"Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?"
...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot!
I thought you were from Iraq.
"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?"
"You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--  Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?"
"Nothing, why?"
"What?  Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both!"
I'm wishing cancer upon you.
That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.
What's so funny!
"Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!"
You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!
This deal's getting worse all the time.
"Terrance, this is Scott."
"Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer."
You're a dick.
You're a dick.
You're a dick.
You're a dick.
The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada! You give other Canadians a bad name! And if I had my hair-
Sure.
You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--
Sure.
Goddammit!
"Sure.  I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour!"
What are you idiots doing?!
Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?
Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.
"Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?"
It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter!
"That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this."
"It's a bomb.  You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions."
"Well, you must do it for Canada."
"Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor."
Hey! What the hell happened! You were supposed to be blown up!
Oh! That is so juvenile!
Of course!
"I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!!"
"And so I told him, I said ""Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks."" And this stupid asshole buys them!"
Speak of the devil! What do you want?
"Uh uh, I don't take returns!"
"You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!"
"Buyer beware, dude!"
"Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in!"
You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
"How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?"
Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty.
"Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars."
"Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back."
"And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes."
"Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!"
Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
No reason.
Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
"They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!"
"Hehere, take your money!"
"Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!"
Have you no heart??
You really went? What a 'tard.
"You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought."
Your grandma?
"Oh.  Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that."
"Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money."
Here you go.
But... just one thing before I give it to you:
I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
Do you want your grandma to live or not?!
"Nono, get down on your knees.  Lower your head , and say ""I beg you to give me back my money."""
"Now say, ""I'm a little piggy."""
Say it!
"""Here's my snout."""
"""Oink oink oink."""
"Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!"
"You mean this?  You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?! My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch."
Now you can't bug me for your dumb money!
Uh huh.
"Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me."
"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy!"
Hello?
What do you want?!
How do you know?
Thennn why are you telling me?
Oh.
See ya.
Hey.
"Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great."
"Wow, a pony ride. Neat."
"Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?"
What?
How can I turn it down?
"Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned."
"Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do."
"Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now."
"I'm proud of you, too, Mom."
What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
Awesome!
The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
"Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything."
Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
"Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?"
"Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it."
"Eh, it's a special recipe."
"I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you."
What?!
My... mom and dad are... dead?
Oh my God!  Oh my God!!
My mom and dad are dead!  No! NOOO!!
Jesus!
"No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!!  Noooo!"
"Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you."
Hey! What the hell is going on?!
Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!
"A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now!"
"This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!!"
Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!
Ey! What are you doing?!
What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!
"You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you!"
Who the hell are you?!
Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!!
Not so fast!
"Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!"
"Haha, you lose, Americans!"
