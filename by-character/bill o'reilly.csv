"Welcome, welcome to the No-Spin Zone, all right? And what we're talkin' about today are the immigrants from the future. All right? Now, most people are more than happy to give a helping hand to these people who obviously need it. All right? But others are starting to say that the time portal should be closed off. All right? Now, I've got two guests with me tonight who have opposing views on the matter. On my right is pissed-off, white-trash, redneck conservative."
"And on my left is aging, hippie, liberal douche."
"Now, pissed-off redneck, you say we shouldn't allow anyone else through the time portal, all right?"
"All right. What say you, aging, hippie, liberal douche"
"All right, redneck, your rebuttal?"
