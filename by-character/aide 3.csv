"Oh my God, she got a scent!"
The pig is picking up the smell of nuclear residue. Terrorists have hidden a bomb!
"Come on, find it. Find!"
"We can't wait for them to find the detonator. If we can get to the bomb, me-maybe we can deactivate it. Can't somebody go and take a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz?"
"That's it! We don't have a choice anymore! Somebody is going to have to go in, and try to disarm the snuke manually!"
"All right, Brian, this is it. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch."
"What do you see, Brian?"
"You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as you can... Y-you have to look inside the snizz."
"You're doin' great, Brian. Hang in there."
"Say again, Brian."
"Team is standing by, sir."
