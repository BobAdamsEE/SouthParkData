"Artonius Jackson catches the ball , he's running down the sideline-  Ohhhh!"
Jackson stops at the 45 and he is slow to get up.
"Yeah, and that doesn't make a lot of sense, because ever since his concussion in '06, he doesn't even have a license."
"Well, during this time out we're happy to be joined by the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Commissioner, a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the NFL. How's the league handling all that?"
"Oh, and it looks like some of the MFL alumni are takin' the field now. There's All-Pro safety Martin Gregors , and fullback Jim Harris. Looks like his pants are down around his ankles."
"Yeah, not sure if that's meant to be a cake or, or perhaps a, a loaf of bread, but he definitely thinks he's baking something."
And with that the Browns are ready to kick it off back to the Broncos
"Manning has the ball. He's saying some really great things about the other team. Manning met by LaMarr Woodley. He's giving the balloon to Woodley. The referee comes in.  Oh, the referee is calling that a touchdown! Oh wait, now another official is signalling that's a safety!"
They're gonna have to sort this one out with a side judge.
