"Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?"
I know. I'm swamped. I've got no help here!
"The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high."
They know about the bomb!
"Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened."
"The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!"
"I understand, comrade."
Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?
"No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out."
"Yeah, but why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?"
"Yes, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?"
"Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill."
Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.
Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time.
Yeah?
"Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers."
"Is that the movers, Satan?"
"Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter."
"Those were some great pork chops, Satan."
"Hey, you.  You've been actin' strange all night. What's up?"
"Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly."
"Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?"
Oh.  Woww!  I wasn't ready for that.
I thought you... killed him.
...Do you still love him?
It's okay of you do.
"Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults."
"We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy."
"Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself.  Oops!  Aw, butternuts!"
There you are.
I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.
"Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight."
I just think we all need to get this out in the open.
"Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together."
"Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore."
"Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein."
"Oh, thank you."
"Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?"
"Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready."
So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.
"Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy."
"L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship  And I just want you to know  that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends."
I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with.  And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything.  Right?  Right.
"Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired."
"Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!"
Goodnight
Yeah.  That's hot.  You take it!  You take it now!
"I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too."
"Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't you, bitch?  I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that."
But it turns you on.
But what?
"Okay. I love you, Satan."
"It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do."
Yeah. Sure. Okay.
"I love you, Satan."
"Hey, you."
You... were out all night.
"Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?"
"Satan, I understand."
I still feel secure and safe with you.
What? What's wrong? I said it's okay.
"Well, what more do you want from me?"
"Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything."
Now you're starting to hurt my feelings.
Agghhh!
Satan!  'Scuse me. Excuse me.
"Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?"
"Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?"
Yeah. It's me.
Yeah...
Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?
Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.
"No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?"
"Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much."
"Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them."
Agghhh!  Oh God!
Nooo! Agh!
Ow!  Goo-aagh..!
Ow..!
Aagghh!
You have?
Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?
Fine.
"Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours."
He sure did!
"Oh, is it someone's anniversary soon?"
"Just kidding.  Oh, I wonder what it is."
"Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!"
"Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. Linda: I hope he means me, haha. Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you."
"I'll be back in a little bit.  Butters, you're in charge of the house."
"Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times."
"Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?"
"Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again."
I'll be back in a little while.
OOH! BUTTERS!
Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!
"Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you."
"Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?"
Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?
"Come here, son.  I wanna have a talk with you."
"Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying."
"Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called ""little white lies."""
"You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house."
"Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane."
"It won't? Oh, good."
You... what?
Linda?? What are you doing??
"Linda, I know this is very hard-"
"I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!"
"It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!"
"No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you.  We can have a normal life!"
Sure there is!
What?
"Oh no.  No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?"
This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.
"No! Linda, we-"
"Linda, Butters is gone.  Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease!"
"Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't know that he's dead yet."
"Yes, it, it sure is."
"Yes, I'd I sure hope we do."
"Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican!  You have to learn to keep it straight!"
"Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you!"
"My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did!"
"Not now, Butters!"
Son! I don't believe it!
"No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why...  Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?"
No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off!
"Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!"
"Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!"
...Butters... You're as right as rain.
"You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first."
"We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us."
"But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us."
"You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers."
"So you see, there was no ""Some Puerto Rican Guy."" He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, ""You're a liar! You're a LIAR!""  ""You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!""  Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, ""Hello,"" but they'd be thinking, ""Ah, there goes that MURDERER!""  ""You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!""  And to me, people might say things like,  ""LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!""  And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like,  ""You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!""  ""CONFESS!""  ""LIAR! CONFESS!""  You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth."
"And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's."
"Let's go, son."
"And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend."
"No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation.."
Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!
Where are Butters and Eric?
Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder!
Okay.
We'll meet you boys on the slopes.
It sure it.
"Hey look, this trailer goes right into a building."
"Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!"
"Ugh! You'd better believe you won't, buster!"
Butters!
"Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try.  Butters?  Butters, this is your father."
Butters? Answer me!
Butters! Right now!
WHAT?!
What's gotten into them?
I'll say!
"That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms.  But first,  maybe we can grab some burgers."
"Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast."
"Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak."
"Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su-"
Us? Your family's all be the shifty-eyed ones!
"Oh, son, can you ever forgive us?"
Oh.
"Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah."
"Oh, hello boys."
"Well, thank you very much, kind heroes."
"Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough."
"Butters,  look what we have for you to watch: The Lord of the Rings."
That's our man. Here you go.
"Oh, hello, Randy, Sharon."
What's the matter?
Butters?
"Butters, where is the movie you were watching?"
Backdoor Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!
"Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time."
The video stockyard.
"Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?"
Wait a minute. Where's Butters?
Uh huh.
Dumbass!
Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?
"Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!"
"Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn."
"Come on, let's go."
"Yes?  Oh, hello, boys."
"Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now."
"I'll do that. Have fun, boys."
"Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well."
A dog parade?
Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?
"We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything."
"And she's... a... girl, right?"
"Well all right! Good for you, Butters!"
"Oh that troublemaking son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister!"
