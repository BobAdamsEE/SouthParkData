"Oh, hello Coach."
"Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied."
"He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo."
Look! He's coming around again.
"Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays."
"Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated."
"Well, what food have you been eating?"
"I'm going to prescribe a laxative.  But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful."
"No, it isn't strep..."
"...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?"
"Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?"
We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.
"It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt."
"Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice?"
"No, he's just passed out. We should get him to bed."
"Well Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal."
"Yep, you check out fine."
For what?
"Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana."
"Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!"
Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.
The what?
"Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer."
"Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-"
Your prescription for what?
What the hell is going on?
This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.
"Hold on, hold people people, please!  We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around! These men all have cancer! It's no coincidence that when this building changed, the rise in cancer went up. Don't you see? The KFC was keeping people healthy!"
"And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us."
"One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat!"
"We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son."
"I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle."
"There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of."
"Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside.  Oops, he's hemorrhaging."
Ooo! His head fell off.
"Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach."
"Well, this is about all I can do for him."
"Sorry, son, it might be a while."
"Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition."
"My God, that's a hell of a storm."
"We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly."
"Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked.  Metaphorically speaking, that is."
"He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out.  Oof. Who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh?"
"Nurse, I could use some help in here!"
"Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!  Oh, sorry."
"Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly."
Do you know anything about surgery?
"What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives."
"Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me.  Nurse Goodly will take care of the anesthesia. Chef, you act as her arms.  Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready?"
"Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart."
Suction!
"I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital."
"We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny.  Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct.  Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here  where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here.  Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?"
"Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!"
"Team B? Come in, Team B."
"Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage."
"Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left."
Good. Head towards it. Team A out.
"Roger, Team B.  He's reached the backup generator.  Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?"
"Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?"
"Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed."
There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!
"No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands."
Kenny! Nnnoooooo!
Quickly! Get the scanner running again!  We've got a chance now!
"Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine."
Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.
It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.
"It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?"
"Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease."
"You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes."
She'll be fine.
We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.
Can I talk to you outside?
"He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while."
"There there now, it's not your fault."
"Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck."
Yes?
Stan?
"Oh, yes. Where is Stan?"
"No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment."
"Oh sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die."
"Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs."
"As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny."
"Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--"
"Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all."
"Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in."
"Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma."
"Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li."
What?
"No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep."
Give the child to me.
Uhhhâ€¦
It's a stick.
"It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it. We had enough."
Mr. and Ms. McCormick.
I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son.
We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do.
"Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank."
My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.
"We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to catch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show."
"You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick.  It's alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle of life."
I can see its head!
"Push, now. Push hard!  Oh my God."
It's ali-
"Alright, send him in.  Oh, Stanley."
How can I help you?
"He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine."
"Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die."
"I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn."
"That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact,  there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle."
"Why, hello there, Eric."
"Oh, I see.  Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?"
"Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery.  If you'll just sign this release."
"Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release."
We believe that you might have a problem.
"Yes, fat camp."
He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.
He's very lucky you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis.
"It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy."
We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading.
"Five me 50 cc's of ketamine, STAT. And get something for the kid, too."
I'm afraid he's... running out of time.
It's his time. It's ...running out.
He needs to have more time.
"Well, I suppose we could try a time transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist."
"Yes, but his time is still getting weaker. It will give out soon unless we do something."
Let's not validate his delusions.
What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant!
"I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's time could give out at any minute. He needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored."
Your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion I've never seen before. His chances of surviving are very slim. I'm so sorry.
Jesus Christ.  What kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog?! Poor little pup.
"I'm afraid I wouldn't know how. Unfortunately for this little fella, I'm a people doctor. Best we call the animal shelter."
He got served. Worst I've ever seen.
We just got the X-rays back.  He mostly got served here  and here . But the worst serving was here in the pelvis region. The road to recovery will be a long one.
"From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one.  It also looks like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride."
We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure.
"Jesus Christ, I've never seen so many Indian sunburns and titty twisters in my life!  Get a cold towel on that pink belly!"
Over there!  Another wet willie?
Give the poor kid some morphine.
"Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl."
"It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus.  I don't know what kind of kid would do this to other people; I only know that I wouldn't ever want to be on that kid's bad side."
"I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma."
There's no telling. He may never recover. We'll just have to wait. And see.
"You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time."
"It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now."
"Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head trauma. Your road to recovery will be long and arduous. At least another two days."
"I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing we could do."
"Yes, it was pretty severe."
This is the young man here. He was in a coma for over sixteen hours.
Of course. Nurse?
