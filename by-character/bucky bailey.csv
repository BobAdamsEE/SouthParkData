"Bullying affects everyone. And only if the entire school is united against it can bullying ever be stopped.  Go, go, get out of here.  Now what we at Bucky Bailey's Bully Busters TM like to do is get the schools to make an anti-bullying video. So who would like to be the young student director in charge of our video?  We just need one student to be the leader of our anti-bullying campaign.  What? Are you all chicken?  Nobody wants to be in charge of the anti-bullying video?"
"Ooooo, you're a big man?! You wanna show what a big man you are?!"
Whassup?!
You went and made a video and sold it without lettin' me know.
"Doin' a video was my idea! It's the property of Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers TM, you got that?!"
"Oh, it's been stwessful?!  What's wrong with you?! Kids are getting bullied at school and with this money, Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers â„¢ can finally become the legit organization it deserves to be! You greedy, selfish, little PRICK!  Oh what? You gonna kwy?"
