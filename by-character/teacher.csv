"And so this shape with four sides is what, class?"
What are you doing?!
I don't think that's really necessary.
"That's enough, class!  Okay, well see you tomorrow, everybody. Ike, could you stay just a few minutes, please?  Ike, I'm very flattered, by all of your love notes, but I need to be clear. See, there've been a lot of female teachers on the news lately who have been having relationships with young male students and, people might get the wrong idea, even though... I do admire you. You are so smart and gifted. Soo mature for your age."
"You listen, and you really care about what I have to say. You make me feel things I've never...  felt before.   Ike, this is crazy. I'm your teacher. How can we be having these feelings for each other?  You're so mysterious, and I can't... and I can't..."
"That was unbelievable. I've never felt like such a woman before. They'll say our love is wrong, but we can't let anybody know; they'll never understand.  We were meant to be, I know it. How else could sex be that incredible?"
OOOH!
"Oh, what's the use, Ike? We're caught.  Hold on, please, you don't understand."
Your brother and I... are in love.
"Ike is very mature for his age, and you know it!"
"He makes me feel like nobody else does. He loves me and only me, and I know I'm a goddess to him. When we make love, he can give it to me HARD, or soft and gentle-"
Is it so hard to believe that true love exists?
"All right, Eric Cartman, let's hear your book report."
Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!
Good.
"Okay. Good, children, good. Remember to feel the clay. Be one with the clay. Nice. Uh huh."
Boys!  What is that?
"You know, I've had it! You four boys never take art class seriously!"
You think art is not important?
"Do you think this is funny?!  Do you think this is funny, huh?!  Well, you four can just spend your afternoon after school here making new pottery!"
I certainly can! I'm your teacher!
Make it two hours!
"Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime, you're being punished!"
"Trent Boyett, what have you done now?!"
"Children, get back away, now!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!   I'M BUUURNIIIING!!!"
