"Helloooo campers!  Yeth, believe it or not, I mythelf used to have unclean urges, and like a lot of you, I thought I was just made that way, that I didn't have a choice. But then I realized that God didn't want me to be that way! God wanted me to be a man!  So I buckled up in my little suit and I prayed to be normal and guess what?  It worrrrked!"
