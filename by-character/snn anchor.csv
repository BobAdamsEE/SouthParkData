"Once again: we have just learned that the Family Guy episode featuring Mohammad was only Part 1 of a two-parter! And Part 2 is going to air next week, with Mohammad uncensored!"
FOX Studios claims that the Family Guy writing staff has demanded the Mohammad character be seen in full view.  The head of FOX had this to say:
"Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat"
The idea has swept the nation! But where will we find enough sand for everyone?
"The popular cartoon, Family Guy, is going to show the image of Mohammad uncensored!"
"...starting in a small town in central Colorado. The idea has now spread all over America.  Muslims continue to riot in the Middle East, demanding that Family Guy not air tonight's episode.  Amd Muslim terrorists continue to make threats."
Osama bin Laden had this to say:
"Bin Laden went on to say that if Family Guy shows the image of Mohammad as planned, the terrorist retaliation will be immediate."
"As soon as the image of Mohammad appeared, terrorist leader al-Zawahri announced the retaliation!"
