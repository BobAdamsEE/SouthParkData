"Thanks, Tom, a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning.  All those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of Park and Jefferson Counties. On the national map, we can see smug over Denver and developing smug in Los Angeles. However, San Francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country."
I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here.  This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength.
"The smug is getting so massive that it's moving west... and fusing with the San Francisco smug... Here.  These two smug clouds are combining, fueling each other.  Now take a look at this."
It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.
"Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction."
"Kid, thanks to your gay little song, there's not gonna be a San Francisco."
Not long. The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona.
"They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time!"
"Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside!  God help us."
