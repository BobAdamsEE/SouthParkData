"All right, little dudes,  great to see you out here. My name is Thumper, and I'm gonna be your cool ski instructor."
"We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, make sure everybody has a goood time. 'Cause what is skiing about? Having a good...?  Time, that's right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you're gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time."
"Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here."
"Alright, we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together , in the shape of a slice of pizza. Then to go faster, we put 'em parallel, like... French fries.  You see that?  Pizza,  French fries,  Pizza,  French fries."
"Okay, let's have the little dude at the end try first! What's your name?"
"Okay, Mike, ski down to me!"
"Okay, you see what he did?! He French-fried when he should've pizza'd. You French-fry when you pizza, you're gonna have a bad time!"
"K-13?! But you're just a beginner! You ski outta your league, you're gonna have a bad time."
"Alright, well, if you gotta get good at somethin' really fast, there's only one way to do it. Come on!"
I heard that you were the one responsible for making Tad lose the race. Thanks.
