"I'm Chris Hansen. You probably know me from To Catch A Predator, where we bust men looking for sex with children."
Go ahead and take a seat. Take a seat right over there.

But now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to Tourette's Syndrome. It all started when I received this touching letter from a brave little boy in Colorado.
"This Saturday on Dateline I'll be bringing you Eric's story, live and uncensored, from his home in Colorado."
"Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrooome. I'm Chris Hansen. Mmh. I'm Chris Hansen."
Why not?
Why don't you have a seat?
Go ahead and take a seat.
"Take a seat, right over there.  What are you doing here?"
But you are doing the show.
Well of course you can't control what you say. You have Tourehhtte's.
Why don't you take a seat?
Have a seat.
"Take a seat, right over there."
"You know, one tiiime, I was doin' a show called ""To Catch A Predator"". We almost caught this pedophile, but then he raaan from us 'cause he didn't wanna be on Dateline.

Be a shame if we had to track you down and you ""shot yourself""."
"Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrome. I'm  Chris Hansen. In a few minutes, you will meet little Eric Cartman, who wants the world to understand his affliction."

"Fine, you lil- I'll, I'll tell on you!"
"Dear Jesus! Hang on, lady!"
"Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair is set to explode!"
It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the speed above 5!
Good! What's the wheelchair's battery power at?
"It's alright, everything's goin' tuh be fine."
"Alright, young man, when you get underneath that wheelchair, I want you to relay back to me with this walkie-talkie, and then I'll tell you which wires to cross. Ready?"
Go below!
Stay calm! You have to stay calm!
"No no, that's only if the boy gets off."
"Got it! I think! Up, up!"
