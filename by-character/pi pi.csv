"Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi Pi. How can I heelp you."
"Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?"
"What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggesteh weekend. Everyone is having uhtheh fun."
"Gehntlemen, pleaseh. I come-a from ada Venice.  Venice is almost all pee. And we doin' just fine. We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee. You can't barge in here and tell me thuh, that I have to close down just because my wahter park has-a too much pee."
"Aaaaa, it's-a the peeee!"
"Why? Why didn't Pi Pi leesten? They tried to warn-a the Pi Pi, but-a the Pi Pi not-a belieeve them."
"Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a ninety percent-a pee."
But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi Pi. In-a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open the door then the pee can be lowered.
"That is-a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest?"
"Please-a you have to hurry!  I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower."
"Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!"
"Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface."
You've got-a the map and-a Pi Pi's instructions?
Good-a. Now just one last thing.  You need to drink-a some pee.
You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.
"You swim-a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate."
"But only you can hold-a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!"
"What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!"
"Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly."
There's no more time-a. You have to drink-a the pee NOW!
"Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee."
"All right, now you can open the release-a valve. Okay, so let's-a"
