"Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more."
"Go away, I I don't have any change."
Yes. Who are you?
Oh my God. Get in here! Tell me what's going on?
Jump them?
Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite understand how the homeless function. Perhaps you should come downstairs. To my laboratory.
"I've dissected several homeless to see what make them tick. Their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours. See? Everything is there: heart, lungs, kidneys, they're almost identical to us in every way. Except for one.  The homeless... can survive solely... on change."
They feed on our change. They need it in order to keep them moving
"Somehow they're able to take... our change... and turn it into nourishment, sustenance."
But now watch.
"It has already completely forgotten that I've given it change. It just wants... more, change. Look over here.  This one I've kept deprived of change for over three days."
It's dying.
I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did. And they were able to stop it.
"Oh my God, they're coming in!  Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit!"
Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!
"Sorry to take the easy way out.  OW! OH, FUCK! OWW!  OHHH! AH! GOD!"
