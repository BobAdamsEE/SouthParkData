Hello.
"Ve are twins, except there are five of us instead of two."
"No no, Natalia is just playing mirror buddies with Nadia."
Count me in.
Grandmama is dead?
Maybe.
"Oh, look. An Easter egg."
"Look at you, Father. You walked out on us five years ago , and now you act like you miss us sooo much! You are a liar and a fake!"
