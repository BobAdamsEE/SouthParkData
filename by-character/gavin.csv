"Look, why don't you just give up? You can't beat us. You really want to embarrass your players?"
"Fine, if that's the way you want it. See ya tomorrow, coach! Adams Team!"
"Come to surrender, coach?"
"HA! I don't think so, Coach. We're gonna beat you into the ground, cancer or no!  Win! Win! Win! Win!"
"Good luck, Coach! You're gonna need it!  Yeah! Let's go Adams!"
"That's it, Brian! Kill him!"
