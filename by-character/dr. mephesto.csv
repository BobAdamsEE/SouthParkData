"There there, my little mouse friend. Soon you will have more asses than you ever dreamed of.  Ah, Kevin. You brought me my Fonseca. That's a good boy.  What's this? Someone is at the door, Kevin.  We tried to be left alone, Kevin. Who would disturb us at this hour? We must be careful.  Why, it's an African-American man, Kevin.  Yes? What do you want?"
"Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in."
There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there.
"No, please, it isn't that at all."
"No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in."
WAAH!
Eric Cartman?
"Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them."
"Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated."
Very well.
"Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in!"
"Oh, all right."
It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.
Yes?
"Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American."
Beat it I'm not helpin' you!
"No no, you don't understand."
"Alright, alright, jeez."
"What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go."
It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.
"Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one."
Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty?
Your father never went through puberty?
"Oh, I can't say that I blame him."
"Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones."
"Yes!  Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me."
My pleasure. I just love helping people.
"I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese.  Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick-  Who could that be?  Why, it's little Eric Cartman."
"Well of course, come in."
"Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people."
"Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA."
Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.
Sure!
