"Yo man, sorry to bother you, but there's been an accident down the street, man. Can I use your telephone?"
"Yo, I understand, man, but this accident is real bad, dawg. My lady's leg is all busted up and shit; she all crawlin' around on the road lookin' like a crippled crab, man. I just need an ambulance, dog!"
"Okay, I see. I guess I understand. You just don't wanna let a black man in yo' house."
"No, I gets it man. Thought things had changed, dog. Thought when we got a black president, things would be different. We gots our black president, but Whitey still don't trust me to use his motherfuckin' phone."
