"Hello young people, and welcome to the most fascinating time of your life. You have braved the trials of childhood, and now you are reaching Canadian puberty. By now, you've probably noticed some changes in your body. For instance, when you fart your dick gets hard.  Other physical changes are happening to your body as well. If you're a boy you may notice that your testicles ache, or if you're a girl, you may notice a tingling sensation in your strange."
"Going through Canadian puberty, you may notice that your voice is starting to change as well. You're saying things like ""hey boddy"" and ""hey guy"" because now that you're older you're discovering that someone who was once your buddy is now your guy, and someone who you used to call ""guy"" is quickly becoming your friend.  But now let's discuss how a man and a woman make love.  First, a man and a woman fall in love. Then the man farts on the woman's strange,  filling the woman's strange with air so that the woman can queef on the man's face.  And, a baby is born.  The entire process can take up to six months a-  It's what? ... That's not how a baby is born? ... What's semen? ... Well then, why did my wife queef on my face? ... She said it was to- ...  Well then why would sh-?! ... I'm gonna get to the bottom of this! "
"Make me look like an idiot, will you?!"
Ey! You told me you queefed on my face because because that's how babies are born!
Being sarcastic?! I just told a million Canadian teenages that's how it's done!
Fine! You want me to go with you to therapy?! Fine!
Totally embarrassing and degrading! She queefed right in my face!
"I try not to think about it, Rick. I try to just forget aboot it and then move on, but I can't. I mean... she queefed right in my face!"
"Yes, we went but... I just can't erase the memory of my helpless face being queefed on like that. Who's to say she won't do it again?"
What do you mean?
"Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day!"
"Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies?"
We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.
They see through the charade.
"I think they see through the charade, yes."
"Alright, fuck it! You've seen through the charade, so you might as well know everything. Charade up!  Allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming. For years gaming was simple. You pay for the game and you enjoy. With mobile apps we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid. But if you pay for incentives, you're rewarded!"
"It's a simple cycle. A never-ending loop based on RPG. Explore. Collect. Spend. Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money."
"And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles. Entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing chachings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-"
-and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.
"No no! It has to be just barely fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun. "
Ehhhveryone is doing it.
It's the way things are going!
Oh. Ah what is the matter?
"Hoh non! Well, we certainly wouldn't want that!  Oh! I have an idea! How about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and, we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in ""moderation""?"
Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time!
"Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game."
"Alright, alright, you've seen through the charade again. Let me explain how freemium games really work.  The truth is, a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them. It's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them. That's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents."
"Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke."
"Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers."
"We're building a new Canada with micropayments from addicts! Who cares?! You think the fucking alcohol industry cares?! They don't care that 10% are gonna get addicted, they're counting on it!! It's the same with ut! But we've got our eye on every addict's screen! Every button they click, we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats!"
"Hohon, I'm much worse than the Devil.  I'm the Canadian Devil. "
