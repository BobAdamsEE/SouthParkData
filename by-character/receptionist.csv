"Sorry Doctor, your wife's on the phone? Says it's an emergency."
"Sir? Sir, do you remember the kids from that South Park Elementary School?"
"They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them."
Can I help you sir?
"All right, and your name?"
"I don't see you on the list, Mr. Clinton."
"Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs..."
"Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?"
"...I sseee, so the fetus is..."
"Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion."
"Yes, this is what we would refer to as the ""fortieth trimester""."
"Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester."
"Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman."

"O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately."
Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo?

...Riiight.

"Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing."
So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?
"Well, Mr. and Mrs..."
"...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together."
Well?
"Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?"
"Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright.  Listen, the South Park Dairy Company is the country's largest. We find lost children all the time.  We can help you find Tommy with the company's database!"
"Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?"
And this was back in Wisconsin?
"Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk  is not only the best resource for finding kids,  but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer."
Can I help you?
