Our next guest is a little girl who was born without a midsection. Please welcome Damla Jones
"You're a very brave little girl, and I'm very proud of you."
Can you tell the audience how miseable your life is?
You're a cutey. Do the other kids at school sometimes make fun of you?
Do people sometimes stare at you?
"Do they go, ""Oh, gross. What the hell is that thing""?"
Well your mommy told us you like to listen to music.
"Well guess what, Damla. We're gonna give you a three hundred dollar gift certificate to CD World in Torrance!  All right, everyone. Stay tuned, because next we're gonna meet a woman who head was smashed in on a locker! And we're gonna giver her a makeover!"
Our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin.
Please welcome eight-and-a-half-year old Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park Colorado.  Thanks so much for coming on our show.
"So, is it tough being ...different?"
And do all the kids at school make fun of you?
"Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?"
You have balls that hang off your chin.
What names do they call you at school?
"And do they call you ""freak"" and ""weirdo""?"
Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth?
"Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you."
"Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world!"
"Go on, you're going right now!!"
We're here talking with moms who think their children are out of control.  Vanessa here says that her thirteen-year-old daughter Vanity is already doing drugs and having sex with older men
"Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework."
"Well, let's bring her out. Here's Vanity!"
"Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen."
Our next mother is Liane Cartman. Her son claims to be the most out-of-control kid in the world and says there's nothing his stupid mom can do about it.
"So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child?"
"Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look."
"Well, let's bring him out. Here's Eric Cartman!"
"Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do?"
"We're here, talking with moms who think their children are out of control."
"Now let's meet Joline. Joline says that her daughter is also out of control, that she's flirting with older men, and, she's only four months old."
"Let's bring her out: here's Chantal!  So Joline, exactly how is your daughter out of control? You say she flirts with older men?"
"Wow, that is out of control!"
What the hell is this?
"Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-"
"Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!"
"Ah, those damned freaks!"
I gave you shoes! And groceries! And this is how you repay me?!  Very well. Just come upstairs and... we'll negotiate!
There a problem?
Right.
You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls.
