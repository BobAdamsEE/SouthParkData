"Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight."
"People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that's a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say ""Well there's fat in butter too,"" but that's just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten?"
"Simply put, gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away. . Flour is of course, just wheat, and when you add a liquid to flour, you get dough.  Dough that makes breads, doughnuts, pasta, and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy.  Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distil the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we're left with is pure gluten. Not a bio-weapon, just harmless flour protein."
Excuse me?
"Yeah. Alright.  Dup, dup."
