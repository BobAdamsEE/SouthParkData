You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit?
Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell!
The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?!
"Tortured, huh, but Bill, all this... torturing and ninjas, it just doesn't seem very Christian."
"Bill, this seems extreme."
"Yes, hand it over!"
We promise.
"Bill, we have zeh rabbit, it's all we need."
"Bill, I'm not sure that double-crossing people is very Christian."
It... can't be.
What?!
"All right, that does it, Bill. I'm pretty sure that killing Jesus is not very Christian."
I am the Pope!
"Forgive me, Jesus."
