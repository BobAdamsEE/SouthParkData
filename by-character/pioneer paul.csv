"Hi, kids, and welcome to my village. I settled here in 1864 with my mahr and pahr. Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange clothes like you all are wearin'. And what's that fancy yellow horse carriage you got out there?"
When you all are ready just head up to the village. All the townfolk are there to answer yer questions. And welcome.  To 1864. Set 'em up!
"These folks sure are strange, Smithy. We ain't never seen them kind of fancy hats in our time, have we?"
Damn it Chad!
This here is our general store. It's where I buy all my supplies an' sich.
"Wuh, sure it is. Just look around ye."
What's a si-rene? We ain't never heard of no sirene in 1864.
"A phone? Why, what's a phone? We ain't never hearda sich a thing."
"Eh storehand, you ever heard of this fancy shmancy phone?"
"If you mean the law, only law around here is town sheriff McLawdog. You see, 1864 is a time of growth and development in the Old West."
"Well, what a straaange contraption."
"Dial out? Partner, them are some funny words you're usin'."
Brresh!
I'll say.
Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots.
Sure. Sheriff got lots of rifles in his office.
"All righty. Come on, storehand."
"What he meant to say, kids, is that we ain't never heard o'no fancy door code 'cause in our time, we gots to rely on wood locks and sich."
You let out Murderin' Murphy?
"You're just gonna have to kill us, mister, 'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all."
"Ohhh, welcome, partner."
"That's right, Murderin' Murphy. He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa."
"Y-y-yeah, I understand that."
"Oh, well uh, I reckon the easiest number to remember for any big safe door lock would be... 1864."
"They shoulda never let you out of jail, Murderin' Murphy!"
We made it!
"Uh, listen, if anyone still wants to know, the phone is in the administration building, you dial 9 to get out, and there's actually a back exit behind the horse troughs. Good night everybody, thanks for coming. We did it, guys!"
