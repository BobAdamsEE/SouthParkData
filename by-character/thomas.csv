He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead."

You would?
We're here to find out why?!
"You've got a problem, Stotch!"
"You know what I'm talkin' about! There was a drone spyin' on my wife, and you're the only person I know with a drone!"
Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now!
"So, thuh so you flew it back here in time."
"Well these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone! "
How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that!
"It's okay honey, the-"
Oh for God's sakes!  Goddamnit get the hell out of here!  That DOES IT!
"You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal!"
"Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!"
Help us with the drones spying on us!!
"It's okay, honey."
"It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-"
"and I yelled. I said, ""What do you want from us, monster?!"" And the monster bent down and said, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty."""
Three dollars and fifty cents.
"That's right. I said ""I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!"""
She gave him a dollar.
"Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!"
"And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-"
"August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-"
"And she says to me, ""How would you like to buy some cookies?"" And I said ""Well, what kind do you have?"" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-"
"Raisin oatmeal, and I said ""We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?"" And she looks at me and she says, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty."""
"Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era."
"I said, ""Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!"" It said, ""how about just two-fitty?"" I said, ""Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!"""
"Damn right, I was angry!"
"Aah, shut your mouth, woman!"
"Sure. That crazy old monster  Now, then the fourth time I saw the..."
"Could I have your attention please?  Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady.  I'm very happy for them both.  Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now."
"Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, ""Poppa, poppa!"" I said ""What do you need, Chef, my boy?"", and he said, ""...I need about tree-fitty."""
"Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, ""Chef, why do you need tree-fitty?"" He said, ""My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it."" I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster!"
"I said, ""Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!"""
"So I chased the monster down the street, you see..."
"...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that."
"Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, ""What do you want from me, alien?!"" and do you know what he said?"
"Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, ""tree-fitty."" And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!"
What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!
Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty!
She's a goddam Succubus!
"Hold on, now, I'll see if I have tree-fitty!"
With who?
Oh.
"I'll ""Oh"" whoever I want!"
"This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids."
"Well come on in out of the cold now.  There's heavy fog on the moors tonight.  Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nelly."
And is this the children you told us about?
"Well, let's see here now.  Mhm, mhm, mhm.  Yeup! There's definitely more than one children in there."
"Nelly, you best have at it now."
"Alright, children, stand up on this chair now."
"Yes, right now."
"Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing."
In the name of all that is holy we command this spirit be set free!
There we go! We're gettin' somethin' now!
Come on out hyow! It's safe!  Here it comes! The spirit is comin' out hyuh!
"Well hold on the potatoes two seconds, woman!  The soul's comin' out hyuh!  It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child!"
"Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we could Kenny's soul into its body."
God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go!
"Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now.  It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light."
"Go on now, soul now!"
"Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!"
"Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin'  Aw Christmas, there it goes again!"
Over here!
Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.
