"Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town."
"Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything."
Careful w'my foot!
Would you mind?! I'm trying to enjoy this musical with my granddaughter!
"I could have so much more with my life, son. I've wasted it. I've wasted it, not ever telling you and Mark that I love you."
Yeah.  Too bad I don't have shit for cash right now.
"Damnit Mona, this isn't the fastest way to Country Kitchen Buffet!"
You save the most gas if you take the highway to Country Kitchen Buffet!
There's Country Kitchen right there!
Right there! You're gonna miss it!
I think so.
"Oh, I'd better get my other sweater."
Yeah.
And we want those damned kids to stop skateboardin' on the sidewalk!
You have to let us in!
