"Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy ""J"" Ranch?"
"Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion?"
You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!
"We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy ""J"" Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!"
Oh? Does it run on electricity?
Not as fat as your face!
"He's not your friend, guy!"
"Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?"
"Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation."
And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!
You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!
Maybe you can go live with the Danish!
"I'm not your friend, buddih!"
It wasn't me!
What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
That's sick!
You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!
"May we come in, please?"
That's right! We've come to kill you!
Why not?
"What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one."
"Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!"
Oh.
"No, I'm Phillip!"
"You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?!"
Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!
"She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!"
"Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her."
"Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you."
"Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!"
Aww. sick!
"Yes, we're looking to buy car insurance."
"Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there."
That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance
"Oh, hello, Ugly Bob."
Because you're goddamn ugly...
What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!
It's the dumbest game over! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!
"But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!"
"We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?"
It's just the way things are going?
It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. 
Do you really think that would help?
But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!
"Okay, but we still won't stand for this!"
"Oh God, he just doesn't stop!"
Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!
Beelzeboot!
Who the fuck is that?
"Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart."
"Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too."
I sure would Terrance.
Take that you stupid dick.
You're exactly right Terrance. Oh.
What?
"Oho yeah, I love beans."
"Well, don't fart on me Terrance."
"You're such an asshole, Terrance."
"Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?"
"Oh, you farted."
"No Terrance, why don't you tell me?"
"Oh, there's one."
Yes Terrance?
"Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check."
Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.
AAAAAH!  Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
"Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass."
"Ah, a squeaker!"
"Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon."
Aaaah.  I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf.
Now he's a smelly Indian.
"Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance."
"Oh, Terrance! You farted in court!"
"Yes, please."
The monkey claw is smelly.
"My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian."
"Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man."
"I have, haven't I, Terrance?"
"Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?  Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.  Just kidding.  The defense rests!"
"Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty!"
Hear hear!
"Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?"
'Cause you're a dick?
Cancer??
"Yes, perhaps he's homophobic."
We're not?
"Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kraft dinner can calm my nerves."
He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.
"The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance."
"Yes, let's look for treasure."
"Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob."
"Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver."
"Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?"
Hello Barky. Hello Purry.
"Say Terrance, I was just aboat to make some Kraft Dinner. Would you like some?"
I'll take that.
"Ooh, Terrannce!  You got a letterr!"
"What is it, Terrance? Did you fart?"
"Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally?! God, why?! Say, Terrance, who's Sally?"
"I never know you had a daughter, Terrance."
"Nno, you never did, Terrance."
"My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion."
"Then I'll go with you, Terrance."
"Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kraft Dinner."
"Hello, Ugly Bob."
"Dammit man!  Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!!"
"Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance."
"Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kraft Dinner."
O Ca-nadaOur home and native land
Burned your face.
"Oh, look. There she is. ."
"Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance.  Oooh, now I see the resemblance!"
"Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend."
Oh my God!  What is this?!  Is this Canada?
This is madness!
"I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?"
"Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!!"
"Because that's his name, you stupid bitch!"
Behold his horrible face!
"Ohh, the humanity!!"
Yes. I agree whole-fartedly.
"Wait, what were you saying?"
"What are you doing, Scott?"
Cancer?!!
"Hey, don't give me cancer!"
"Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television."
Oh look. Here's a show.
"Goddamn, their TV shows are lame!"
Look at their silly American heads.
"Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator."
"That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance."
Tell him he's a smelly bastard.
"Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?"
"No, we're searching for treasure."
What do you mean?
"You mean, we are to blame?!"
What is this?
"For Canada, Terrance."
Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life.
Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.
"That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?"
Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!
"I do, Terrance."
Yes. Prepare the alert!
"Oh, Glorious Day!"
"Don't touch me, Ugly Bob!"
"We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada!"
"Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities?"
That's tomfoolery.
"Give it to me straight, Terrance."
"Oh, what a relief!"
Cancer?
My ass is collapsing?
Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
"What's happening here, Terrance?"
Who's the donor?
"Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?"
"All right, Terrance."
"Well, all right."
Okay.
"God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!"
"That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance."
Aaaaagh!
"That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing."
Waitwaitwaitwait.
"Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here."
"Okay, waitwait waitwait."
"Oh God, you're smelly!"
"Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart."
"Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?"
"How do you like that, Terrance?"
"Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso."
Look closer.  Closer.  Hunh-nh.
Waitwait. Hunh.
"Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here.  Ah!  Af!"
"Excuse me, buddy."
I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?
Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?
"No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?"
"Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?"
Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?
...after these messages.
Ahhh
Yes?
"Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there."
AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!
"Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long?"
"Yeah, whatever, kid."
What?
Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?
"I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details.  Gotta run!"
"Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?"
Whatever. Where's my check?
What's HE doing here?
"So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?!"
"Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!"
Really? Let me take a look.
Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-
"You're right. It's a better one, asshole!"
"Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!"
That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!
"Excuse me, which way is the bus station?"
What?
"Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war."
That's better.
"Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?"
"Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said?"
"Wow, that sucks."
Terrance...
"I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before."
We sssure did go through a lot together.
"Terrance, I-"
"That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.  But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did."
"That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks"
"Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted?"
"NO, I'm asking you his name!"
Here's a man's fart for ya.
"Oh no, hahahahahahaha."
"Oh, what is it?"
"Killing is never an accident, you dickface!"
"Hey Terrance, I think I have a-"
What?
