"Eric, why would you do such a thing?"
"That's very naughty, Eric."
I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like.  I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day.  He just never listens.
"It's not him, it's you, Eric.  I don't know what to do with you."
"Yes. I think it's the nanny, boopsiekins."
"Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in."
"All, all right dear."
"Yeah, it's best to avoid his level."
"Eric, naughty."
"Oh, but we really need some help."
What do you mean?
Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.
"Please, come in."
"Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life."
What what is it that you're doing?
"Oh, that's very interesting."
"Well, no, I don't."
Tsst.
Ahall right.
Tsst.
It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.
"Oh, very good, sweetie."
"Wow, I have a lot to learn."
Oh dear.
But what if he does run away.
"Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home."
"Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was."
Cesar...
"Yup, just like you said he would."
He said he's hungry. What should I do?
"Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!"
Tsst.
Tsst.
Tsst.
Tsst.
Tsst.
I did it!
Oh... Oh my gosh!
He's never done this before.
"I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine."
"Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it."
I am the pack leader!
Sounds divine!
"Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him."
The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.
"There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child."
"Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life."
"Why Eric, you made your own breakfast."
And you're studying before school?
"Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you."
"I love you, sweetie."
Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.
"Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son."
"You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night."
Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.
"Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?"
"Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger."
"Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want."
Yes hon?
"Right away, hon."
What hon?
"Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he?"
"There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?"
When does it come out?
It's time for school
"Eric, you're just going to have to be patient."
"Eric, you're coming home right now!"
It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.
Whoa!
"Eric, get out of there."
"Now Eric, this has gone far enough!  You need to learn to be patient!"
"There you are, Eric."
"Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out."
"But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months."
"Who are you talking to, muffin?"
"Eric? What's the, what's the matter?"
"Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened."
"Oh, now why would he do that?"
"What is the picture of, Eric?"
"Ohh, that's nice."
"Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen."
"It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother."
"Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother."
"Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth."
"Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine."
You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
"She said she was sure, Eric."
"Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it."
"It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse."
Oh...
"Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called ""Tour, Tourette's Syndrome""?"
"Oh Doctor, can you help him?"
"Is there a problem, sweetie?"
"Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?"
"What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?"
"Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey."
"That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!"
"I'm so proud of you, Eric."
"Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor."
...What!?
"Oh, my poor little baby!"
Oh God!  Oh no!
"Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!"
"Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?"
"Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice."
"Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?"
"Sweetiekins, are you all right?"
"No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you."
"Oh no, thank you so much for your time."
"You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin."
"You all right, sweetie?"
What's going on?
Oh dear.
"Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?"
"Aww, what happened, hun?"
"The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient."
"Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?"
"Alright honey, let's take it easy."
"Please, leave my boy alone!"
No please!
"Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?"
"Well, all right.  I guess I can get some groceries anyway."
"All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?"
"Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!"
"Oh my goodness, it's a fire."
"No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!"
"Eric, poopsie?"
"Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job."
"Yes, Mysterion?"
"Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?"
"Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!"
Eric Cartman!
"Where have you been, young man?!"
"Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!"
"Eric, are you listening to me?!"
What?
"What do you mean ""what should-"""
"I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade."
"What happened, Eric?"
"Oh, sweetie, $900?"
"Eric, we can't afford that one."
"I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper."
"Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook."
"This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price."
"Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!"
Eric!
"Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!"
You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!
"Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say ""Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!""?"
"If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!"
No!
"Eric, stop it!"
"Eric, you come home, right now!"
I DON'T!
"My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad."
"Here you go, sweetie."
"Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too.  Otherwise, he gets a little upset."
"Here you are, muffin."
"Eric, you wanna say hi to Grandpa?"
"No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?"
"Are you sure, sweetie?"
But who would want to s-
What?
"Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?"
"Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-"
"No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear."
"Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-"
"Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it."
Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.
"I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token."
My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic.
What hon?
"Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet."
"What is it, hon?"
"Hi, sweetie."
"Oh, what is it this time?"
"What, hon?"
"Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can."
"Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it."
"Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people."
Oh.
"Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while."
"Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
The what?
Oh sure.
"It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty."
Oh.
Safety belt?
"Everything okay, sweetie?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this."
Ohhh...
"Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?"
"Oh my goodness, what's going on?"
"Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?"
"Oh well, no TV for him for a few days."
"Eric, honey, what's the matter?"
"I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe."
"Honey, it's okay."
"No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon."
"No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?"
"Okay, hon."
"Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you."
"Eric? Poopsiekins?  Eric?  Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now.  I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat?  All right, I'll just leave it here, hon.  I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you."
"Hello, Eric."
How are you doing?
"Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise."
"You're not fat, you're big boned."
"You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?"
Just a weensy geensy woo woo?
"How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?"
"Yes, hon?"
"Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?"
"Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight."
"Eric, look who's here."
"That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends."
"Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow."
"Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous."
"Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts."
"Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy."
"And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away."
You give your mommy a kissy.
Scuzzlebutt saved the day.
"Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth."
"Ohhh, okay hon."
"Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working."
"Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?"
"Ohhh, yes, indeedy."
"Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things...
Hello there!"
Happy Halloween!
"It's the most wonderful time of the year
do do do do do do do do-"
Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?
Sure hon.
Not yet hon.
Yes hon?
"Sure, hon."
You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?
Okay.
"Come on, kiddies. Eat more."
"More pie, hon?"
"Hello, boys."
"Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard."
"How is your beefy roast, snookums?"
"Sure, hon."
Uh huuuh.
"Yyeess??  Well, what's your question, hon?"
Oooooohh.
"Ooohh, hhmmm . Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other , they want to be... close to each other."
And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha.
"Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance."
I was young and naive then...
"Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he.  I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?!"
"Well, go right ahead, Officer Barbrady."
"And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.  I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin."
Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
"Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder."
Wait. Wait.  Who is that?  Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?
Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before.
"Well, what's a nice, handsome, black  man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?"
"Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?"
"Ahah, I'm plastered!"
"Whoa, Chef!  You're so strong!"
"Oooohh, Chef! Woooo, Chef!"
Woooh! Whooppee!!  Unhh!
"Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a manage o'three?"
I want to have... an abortion.
"Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world."
About eight years ago.
Eight years old.
Really?
But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
"Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body."
"Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day!"
"...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed."
But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
"Oh, dear."
"Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one."
"I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know..."
"Oh, thank you, thank you."
Terminated?
Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
"Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption."
"Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President."
"Yes, it's true."
It's true.
"I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.  I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you."
Hello?
"Oh yes, Sharon. How are you?"
"Hu-old on, dear, let me check.  Hon, I made beefy logs.  I made Cookie Dings.  No, he's not here."
"Oh, dear!"
"Ah-are you okay, hon?"
Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast?
Mmmm.
Mmmm. Beetles are good with ice cream.
I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
"Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it."
"Don't scratch it, hon."
"No, hon."
"Here, I got you some calamine lotion."
It'll make your itches go away.
"Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad."
"I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion."
"Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while."
"Ooh, I have them somewhere else, boopiekins."
"What's that, Eric?"
"Don't pick your nose, hon."
Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.
"Hello, everybody.  Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon."
"Thank you.  Don't pick your nose, hon."
"Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy."
"Oh wait, wait.  You've got a little eye booger, hon."
Got it.
"Don't pick your nose, hon."
"How's the treehouse coming along, hon?"
"Sorry, hon."
"Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare."
"Well, all right."
"Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.  Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?"
"Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends."
Around six hours.
"Well, I've got an idea. We could sing."
Over the meadow and through the woods
"Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy."
"Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska."
"Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--"
That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.
"About another hour, hon."
"Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.
Over the meadow and through the woods"
Here we are.
Hello everyone. Happy Holidays!
"These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky."
"Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra , Fat Bob, Jimmy , and great-grandma Florence."
"No, no, Florence, that's not Eric."
"Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley."
"Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner?"
Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.
"Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?"
"Hi, Howard."
Hello?
"Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon."
Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.
"Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?"
"Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples."
"Yes. Apples.  Ahapples, get it?"
"Stinky apples. See you, boys."
Squeaker!
"You have to see the eye doctor, Eric."
"You're not fat, you're big-boned."
"There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor."
Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
"Now, hon."
"Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right?"
"I'll think about it, hon."
"Mommy's busy, boopie-kins."
"Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends."
Hmmm.
"That's nice, muffin."
"Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best."
"Eric, this is for the best."
"Eric, it's important for you to understand-."
Eric.  The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs.
"I have to leave soon, Eric."
Come down as soon as you're done.
"Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly."
All those other babysitters won't come back.
"Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears."
Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.
"Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?"
Be good.
Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses!
Eskimo kisses for Mom-my!
"Bye, kids."
"No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors."
"This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up."
"Not really, hon.  Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour!  Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!"
"Hi, kids. I'm home."
"Oh, what a party that was!  Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm."
"Eric, calm down."
"What is it, Eric?"
"I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric."
"Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?"
Alright! let's go.
They're so strange. Where are they from?
"Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad."
You have?
"Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron."
"Eric, your little friends are here."
"E-heric, it's only Halloween."
"I'm sorry, hon,"
"Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned."
"Eric, Mommy got you a present!"
"Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow."
"This year is gonna be different. Look!  I got you ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics."""
It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee.  It says we just put the cassette into a tape player
"Hon, are you ready for some math problems?"
"Oh, all right."
Yes?
"Sure, hon."
"Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs."
"Eric, please. We have to do some studying today."
"Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?"
"Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!"
Oh my goodness.
"Oo, poopiekins?"
"What is it, snookums?"
Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
"Don't say ""tits,"" Eric."
"Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest."
"But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving."
"Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night."
"No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight."
"Good night.  What do you have there, Eric?"
"Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days."
"Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman."
"Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried."
About a hundred and twelve.
Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
"O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week."
"Yes, Eric"
"Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month."
"I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later."
"No, honey. It's just-"
"Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child."
"Eric! Eric, wait!"
"Oh, don't they look precious?"
"Eric, sshhhh."
Yes.
"Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?"
Alright.
Oh my.
"Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?"
"Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you."
And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS.
"Isn't that funny, sweetie?"
"You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass."
"Boopie-kins.  It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie."
"Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise."
What?
"Oh. Well,  alrighty then."
I... don't think it worked.
"Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you."
"Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness."
"Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill."
"In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first?"
"Come this way, Billy."
"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!"
"Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed."
"Now, hon!"
"Twenty more minutes, and that's it."
"Eh yes, sweetie."
"Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?  Mommy's  expecting  some company."
"Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a ""talk"" with you."
Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
"Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat."
"...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want.  Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin."
Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.
"Oh.  Well, goodbye, sweetie."
"Thanks for coming, everybody."
"Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman."
Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp.
I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
"We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see."
"Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over."
"No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business."
"In a minute, sweetie. This is important."
A million dollars?
Oh my.
"Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?"
"Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here."
"Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you."
They say it's an emergency.
"Yes, sweetie?"
"What's that, my little man?"
"Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop."
Orf course I do.
"Sweetie, don't."
"I'm glad you're not that bad, poopsie-kins"
"Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle"
"Oh, he's such a cutie."
"Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear."
"Oh, I mean, sex and drugs."
"Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food."
"Oh, all right."
"Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer"
"That's nice, poopie."
"Oh, hello boys."
"Oh, but I thought your teacher died."
"Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls."
Sweetie.
You have to get ready for school
"Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back."
"You'll get over it, honey."
What's going on?
I heard an explosion.
"Bad, Eric, bad!"
"Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film."
Mee too.
Be careful with my baby.
"You're going to be okay, baby."
Is he going to be okay?
Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?
Why?? What's wrong with him??
"Well, what does he need?"
What can we do?
"It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time."
He's looking a little better today.
"Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life!  Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there."
Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out!
It's too far and your parents want you back home.
"Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon."
"Please, call me Liane."
Oh dear.
Get it down.
"Oh, baby, your time is back!"
"Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie."
I thought you got it.
He's an imspration to us all.
"Is he going to be all right, doctor??"
"Oh baby baby, you can't die."
"Whoa. Easy, Kyle."
"I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!"
"What's the matter, sweetie?"
Oh dear.
"Oh dear.
Dr. Doctor:
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane."
"Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest."
"What is it, sweetie?"
"Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with youuu."
"Boys, you have a little visitor."
"Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty."
Well you should've called Mommy.
"Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?"
"Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!"
"Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie?"
"You too, Eric."
"That's a great idea, Chef."
"Yes, hon?"
"What's that, hon?"
"Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... ""special"" children."
"You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea."
"...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No."
"Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow."
"Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please."
Eric Cartman...
He's nine.
"...Um, he's retarded."
"Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition?"
"Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?"
"Oh, that's great, sweetie."
"Okay, hon."
"Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately."
"Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago."
"Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over."
"Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Mommy's here. Sweetie?  Oh, what's wrong with him?"
"Coma... My God, fo- for how long?"
Oh my- Doctor!  He's awake!
"Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!"
"You're doing so much better, muffin."
"Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again."
His new... powers?
"Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy."
"Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you."
"Ah, no, these people claim that they are the ""real"" psychic detectives."
"Oooh, I'll go make some tea."
"Oh, goodness! What's going on?"
O-o-o-o-oh!
Is it over?
"Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early."
"Sweetie, can't we go after school?"
"Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you."
"Ohoho, nhn."
Yes?  Oh hi.
"Oh, what is it?"
"Oh, that's so nice."
"Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins!"
That's my little boy.
"Eric honey, time to get up for school."
"Poopsiekins!  Sweetie, what is the-  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
Oh my God! Eric!
You mean...
Oh...
"Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie."
