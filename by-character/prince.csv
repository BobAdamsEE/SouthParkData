Where is the roof on this thing?
"Oh, I'm only the Prince of Canada! And this happens to be the Minister of Mobile Gaming."
"Ey! We know the game's not great, but who cares? It's free!"
"Uh oh, you think so?"
I'm pretty sure they can hear us too. 
"Free""mium"". The ""mium"" is Latin for ""not really."""
It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun.
So they'll forget they're spending money.
Your checks of course. For ten million American dollars. Each.
"You've both done an amazing job. New hospitals, new neighborhoods, all funded by one freemium game."
"But just look at all the things we're getting to build. Soon, Canada will be as advanced and developed as Michigan."
Ohhhhh. 
You what?
"Minister of mobile gaming, what's this all aboot?"
"Oh, what have I done?!"
"My fellow Canadians, what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others. We have all learned a tragic lesson together: that though many sins are out there, when you get involved with freemium gaming, you are making a deal with the Canadian Devil. We will no longer make freemium games, and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts. Canada is back to being an ethical, respected, and shitty tundra. "
