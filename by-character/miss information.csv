"You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins."
"All the horrible food we eatâ€”the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper."
What?
"Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans."
"Good morning, everyone."
"Huuuuuuuuuh  Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better."
"Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter."
"Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system."
"Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!"
"Oh, look everyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez."
Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.
Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.
Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit.
"Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you."
"Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic medicine is about NATURE.  Two-hundred and thirty-three dollars."
And next we have Mrs. Broflovski's son.
Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again.
"Uh, toxins are your enemy."
