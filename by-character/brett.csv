Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it?
"Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress."
Have you ever heard of...  Heroin Hero?
Ihit's a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You could call it the ultimate first-person shooter.
No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don't ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it.
"There he is! So, did you break a million yet?"
"Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top."
"Have you played...  Rehab Hero? You get chased by a big dragon, but you keep running away from it."
Sssure kid. Sure.
