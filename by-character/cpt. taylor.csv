I don't get it. They said the military would meet us here.
I'm trying.
"Hey, Connor, the place that Homeland Security told us to start the operation, there, there's nobody here to meet us. It's like they sent us to no man's land."
What are everywhere?
"Michaels, Harrison, anybody?  Nothing. LSAT is down and no answer at RCU. Whatever is going on out there is huge."
"...Yes, that was the order."
"Nope, not at all."
"You don't understand, the plan was to have a refueling truck meet us here. We don't have enough gas to fly anyplace."
"It's starting to look that way, yeah."
This whole valley is strange. Just look at the size of that fruit.  Ain't that a peach? And how do you like them apples?
Oh my God.
"It's like... an unknown valley that time forgot, where everything grows huge."
"Look, wherever we are, I think we'd better keep moving."
"Ohhh stop it, make it stohhhp!"
