Your friend Kyle told me you don't understand the importance of voting.
"Apparently, you haven't heard of my ""Vote or Die"" campaign."
"What you think it means, bitch!"
Rock the vote or else I'm gonna stick a knife through your eye.
"Get out there and vote or I will motherfucking kill you. 
Yeah."
"I like it when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
Shake them titties when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
I slam my jimmy through your mouth roof (mouth roof)
Now get your big ass in the pollin' booth.
I said vote, bitch, or I'll fucking kill you!"
"You can't run from a .38, go ahead and try!"
'Cause after I slit your throat you won't have a fucking voice
Vote or die! Vote or die!
"No, Justacious, let him go. He won't survive a fore-night in the wilderness."
"Yo, what did I say was going to happen to you, bitch?"
"Itius, Rodicus!"
