"Today, I went to 7-11 and I ate a Slim Jim. It was the greatest thing I ever tasted. Nobody ever stood up for me before."
"You make me come out of my shell, Shelly.
You give me strength where there was only fear
I ate at a Burger King today, Shelly
And stood up to a boy who called me ""queer""
When you pushed me off the diving board I
...fell.
And you make the world a nicer place, Shelly
So I can come out of my... shell."
"Oh no, you built another settlement?"
Oh wow!
What the hell is going on here?! This is the DMV! There will be no joy here!
"Shut up! Sit there and wait, and no cell phones or other things that pass time joyously! I'll put a stop to this! "
"No... No, leave them alone. It's a nice change to see people happy here at the DMV.  Perhaps we here at the DMV can start changing as well. Perhaps instead of treating people badly we can offer them comfort and hope. Why, the DMV can be a place where people come to get things off their chests. Confess, yes, but also be told that they're worth something in this world! And then, DMVs everywhere can become a place where people feel safe. And when they do something wrong we can offer forgiveness! Don't you see what this could lead to? Don't you see what we could become??"
"Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?"
Thanks.
Arrrggh!
"Leslie. It's me, Larry.  Your husband?"
"Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years?"
That was me!
So you... remarried.
Larry!
Didn't anybody send out a search party?
"Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused."
You're Leslie.
"I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone.  Eight and thirteen?"
I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again.
"Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over."
What is that?
Home.
They're coming for me!
"Okay, boys. Thanks."
I got my ticket.
I have to go to Platform B.
"Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys."
"You boys have really shown me the true meaning of friendship. You didn't care about anything but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about."
"After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world!"
"Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends!"
"Oh, poo!"
Huh?  Whah?!
I've got you pinned. I win.
Nooo!
Oohh!
Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines!
"I'm not living here! Living is having ups and downs and sharing them with friends!  Thank you, Stan and Kyle! See ya!"
He-e-ey George! What's gon' on?
"Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now."
I'm afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research.
"Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people."
"This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up."
"Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a blank cell. Do you understand?"
"Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the missing part of the spine."
Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells.
That's the theory.
"Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber."
"But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know."
Where are you going?
Hey kid.  Give 'em hell. Give 'em hell.
"Oh, hey kid.  Good luck. Good luck."
