Who are you to judge my womanly soul?  The Goddess flames that burn in my memory aren't dark. Dare you call them dark!  Here lies the Goddess truth of my body.
"The Goddess that cries, ""Freedom!""  Here is the Goddess truth of my womanly being  You are my blossom, my flame. When we make love, it's like the sun is right outside the door."
