How's my little piggy today?
I just say that because you're my little buddy.
Hop up on the chair.  Don't break it now!
Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing.  All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?
"All right, read them out for me."
"No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence.  I do not know how that happened.  ""I am a little piggy."" Wow! What are the odds of that?  All right, let's get down to business, shall we?"
"Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?"
Just pick one. Or two.
"Okay. One, or two? One, or two?"
"One, or two? One, or two?"
"No! The answer is one, piggy! One!"
"Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests."
"All right, we got the test results back, piggy-"
You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
"It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better."
"Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new."
"I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses."
That's why we have the little stapler.
"Okay, let's get started. You're here for the liposuction, right?"
All right. Time to laser me a little piggy.
I bet his mom wishes she could do that.
"Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes doing?"
"I don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes."
Was he an organ donor?
"All right, then let's get to work.  Say, you don't have three dollars and fifty cents on you, do you?"
