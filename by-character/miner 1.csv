The cave-in was massive. It has cut off all access in or out. The children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area.
"No, nobody seems to knew them. Only that they were in the tour group. Digging to them is going to take days."
What do you mean? The cave-in is over.
What's that?
"All right, people, we've gotta work faster! Our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called Smuggler's Den."
"Based on where the boys were seen last, they're somewhere near this area! Hopefully they've followed the first rule of survival and stayed put."
That's it! Pull everyone out! There's nothing more we can do!
We didn't plan on a freak river flood. God must really want those kids dead.
"Look, the cavern is completely flooded. Nothing could have survived. There's nothing left alive down there."
It's the kids!
