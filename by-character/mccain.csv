"It is natural. It's natural tonight to feel some disappointment. We fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours."
President Obama.
I almost thought we were gonna tie for a minute there. That would have screwed us.
"It's McCain, we did it! Obama is President."
"Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours."
"Actually, the hard part's just starting."
"Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever."
"My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history."
Million.
"Meet... the Presidential Escape Tunnel,  A two-mile long underground passage that runs from the White House to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack. The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum."
"You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on."
And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours.
"Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian.  You find the escape tunnel?"
"Hello Sarah, it's McCain."
"All right, here we go."
"Hi, Michelle."
"Michelle, we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay."
Thank you very much.
"B, you can't be serious."
I just looove happy endings.
