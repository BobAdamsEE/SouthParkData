"You have lost faith in humanity, lad. Something I cannot bear to see happen."

"Look here, Tweek. This woman is on her way to the retirement home.  She doesn't get paid; she volunteers her time to talk with lonely elderly people who want nothing more than a friend.  But do you hear about her on the news? No."
"Now gaze upon this humble house, Tweek. Inside there are two people who have adopted needy children.  They were strangers to those kids once. Now they are loving parents"
"Now, look here, boy.  A car has broken down with a flat tire, and two complete strangers have stopped to help.  Will their kindness be reported on the news tomorrow? I think not."
"Are you starting to understand, boy?"
"That's right, lad. So do you think you can learn to trust people now?"
"Good. Then why don't you get into the back of my van, and I'll drive you home."
"Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!  Oh, I was so close!"
And I would have gotten away with it again if it weren't for you meddling policemen!
