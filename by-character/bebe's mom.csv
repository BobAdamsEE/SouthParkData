"Bebe, is something the matter?"
"Oh, sweetie. You're all just growing up.  Part of being a woman is having a friend one day and calling her a slut the next."
"Oh, hello, boys."
"No, she's with one of her little friends. But she should be back shortly if you boys wanna wait."
"I believe she is playing ""Lambs"" over at Eric Cartman's house."
"Bebe, those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if you'll come out."
Looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers.
"Sweetie, you're just blossoming into a woman."
"Sweetie, you're a Stevens. And Stevens women are always told they're really, really smart."
