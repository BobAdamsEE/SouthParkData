"Welcome to tolerance camp. You are here because you would not accept people's differences.  Because you refuse to accept the life choices of your fellow man. Well those days are now over. Here you vill verk, every hour of every day until you submit to being tolerant of everybody. Here, intolerance... will not be tolerated."
Today we will be using the fingerpaint! You vill make a painting that shows people of different races and sexual orientations getting along. Fingerpaint. Fingerpaint!  You vill not make any distinction between people of different colors! People with different sexual preferences! You vill accept everyone!  What are you fingerpainting?!
Ein bear?! Und bear has nothing to do with accepting people of different races!
Start over!  You will fingerpaint what we tell you!  GO!  Faster.  Faster!  Faasterr.
