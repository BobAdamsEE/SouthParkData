Ye Yeah-ha.
Mmmmm.
"Come on, babe. How long have we known each other?"
And I still don't get any action.
But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.
Mmmmm
"Beat it, chubby!"
Mmmmm
"Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room."
"Red Rocket spills my icy soul.
Demons from Hell seek the chosen one!"
"Isn't this guitar awesome? It's the best of its kind, and not a scratch on it."
I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them.
"I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar."
"When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff."
Mmmmm.
"Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice."
"Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe!  'Sup Mark?  'Sup up. Jonesy?"
"Okay, check check, check, 1, 2, check. Okay, ready? All right, let's try the new song. This is a song I wrote for you, Shelly. 
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4
When I saw her walking down the street, I thought she was Shelly, Shelly."
"Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly."
"Move into my mom's house with me, Shelly Shelly"
"Bridge!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of Shelly
Shelly!"
"Ey, shut up, tubby!"
"Yah, dude, that was hot. This guitar rocks, man! It rocks! What do you think, Shelly?"
"O-kay, why don't you sing it for us?"
"Hey man, don't be shy."
Don't you know? Isn't...
Shut up!
"You guys, get out! Don't question my love! My love is as pure as morning snow! Get out, I said!"
Yeah! Come on! Give it up!
"Give it up, babe!"
"Come on, babih!"
Why the hell not?!
You're not putting out for me?
"Well then, screw you, bitch! I've got plenty of other girlfriends that will!"
"If you're not puttin' out, then I'm movin' on! There's plenty of chicks like you out there!  Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta!"
What the hell is this?!
"Salma Hayek? Whoa, she's hot."
"Hello-o? Hello-o, Mrs. Hayek?"
"No clothes, right."
"Right here, Miss Hayek!"
What the?
"Dude, somebody tricked me! I'll make you pay for making me come out here, God damnit!  Stupid asshole stuffed animals trying to ruin my night!  My guitar! NOOOOO!"
"You two ruined my career! I'm gonna get you!  Umph  Ogh! Oh! Owey! Owwey! Duewy! Oh!  Oh, you ripped my pants off! Oh my God! Oohh my Goodd!"
"Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!"
"Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?!"
We've just gotta practice more.
"Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top!"
"Huh-I don't know, man.  Whoaaa!"
"You a singer, man?"
Yeah!
1 2 3 4
Listen to them. They really love me.  Wooo!!
Yes! I'm a rocker!
Yeah?
"Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla."
"Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run."
Huh?
"Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld."
"Uh, thanks man. See ya."
"Yeah. All of them chanting ""Timmy, Timmy."""
"The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy."
And the Lords of the Underworld!
"It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!"
"Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm movin' on!  I don't need Timmy!  I'm goin' solo!"
"No! Don't try and stop me, man!  I'll see you on fame's backside."
Hey dudes.
They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.
"I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head..."
"What do you say, Timmy?"
