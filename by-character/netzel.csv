"Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park.  Everyone is giddy with anticipation for Jesus to come out, because as we all know, if Jesus comes out of his house and is not scared by his shadow, it means the next thousand years will be full of peace and love.  Oh, it looks like Jesus might be coming out!"
"Everyone is quiet here, Tom. Looks like the little fellow's a bit nervous.  But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us!"
"...Well, it's... the millennium, Jesus."
"Well, it's ""The Millennium""."
...I don't know.
"Tom, it looked for a second as if Jesus was going to come out of his house, but then he went back inside. But meanwhile, more and more people are showing up to show their support for Jesus."
"Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas, where tomorrow night THE New Year's Eve event is going to happen. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is presenting Rod Stewart, the undisputed King of Pop, right here at this hotel behind me.  It looks as though Jesus really has come through.  Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event."
"How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night?"
"Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as ""the gayest party ever."" Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
