"Mr. Chef, is it?"
Clyde Harris?
"Paging Dr. Bender? Paging Dr. Bender, please?"
"There, just take a seat over there."
Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?
Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself.
"You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere."
"Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in."
Doctor?
It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.
"Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now.  I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see."
"Come, come, right over here.  We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up."
"Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart."
Everything okay in here?
O-kay.Â 
Reason?
Any allergies?
Jacket!
"Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone."
"Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up."
"Again?!  Now, Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie?"
"Dr. Flores, dial 18-"
Mr. Marsh is here to see you.
"Doctor, Eric Cartman is here-"
Just a little more.  There we go.
"Yes, Doctor."
"Hey, look who has some visitors."
"Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now."
"Hey, look who's here."
Can I help you?
You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.
Oh my God!  What the-?! Doctor? Doctor?!
"Can you help him, Doctor?"
Right away.
"Shh. Relax, Mr. Marsh."
"Yes, Doctor."
Mrs... Garrison?
