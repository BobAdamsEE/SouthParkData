"Ladies and gentlemen, I have dire news. Yesterday, at approximately 18:00 hours, terrorists successfully attacked... our imagination."
We've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast. Luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public.
Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement.
"Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild."
"What I am about to tell you is highly classified. Two days ago, Muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination.  Frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them."
"That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam.  The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists?"
"N, no. No, they're terrorists. They've been linked to Al Qaeda."
"No- No. That's not an idea, that's a twist. We need ideas."
"Get him out of here.  Mr. Bay, can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists?"
No no! We need ideas how to stop the terrorists!
"Those aren't ideas, those are special effects!"
"I know you don't. Get him out of here!  Aaand being that we are all big Mel Gibson film fans, we thought maybe you could help us."
"Yes, uh, I don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists?"
"Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it!"
"I want digital imaging and resource magnification done stat!  If that kid isn't imaginary, I want to know who he is, where he's from, and who his friends are!"
Who are you?...
You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security.
There's no time! You need to come with us right now!
We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information.
Terrorists have just attacked... our imagination.
What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!
"Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild!  You'd better start remembering!"
"That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?"
Shhh! Tom! That's super-secret.
"Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?!"
"THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!"
"All right, we might as well show it to them.  God-dammit, Tom."
"Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called ""Project Imagination Doorway."""
"According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has."
They've been saying that for over forty years.
Song? You didn't say anything about a song before.
Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go?
I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety!
"All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!"
"All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready?"
"Are you ready, Kurt Russell?"
"Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard!"
What?!
Sector Two??
Who the hell are you?!
Get him out of here!
Let me see that!  Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?
"All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here."
"You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it."
"Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?"
"Good luck men! Godspeed!  What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me?"
What do you see in there?
Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack.
What?
What's the matter?
"Kurt Russell, what's going on?!"
"Get out of there, Kurt Russell!"
Talk to me! What's going on?!
Look out!
Reverse the doorway! Send it back through!
"He's gone, little boy."
We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option.  We have to nuke our imagination.
"We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild."
By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination.
We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters!
Thank you.
"All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books."
What?!
Sector 2?
What?
"All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!"
Prepare for launch...
What?!
Sector 2?
The hell are you doing back here?!
Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!
"If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?"
Abort the sequence.
"There's been an abort, Mr. Gore."
That's true. You did.
"Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working."
Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!
What's wrong with it?
My God.
"All right, Internet. What do you want from us?   If we've angered you somehow, let us know.  Try to communicate with it digitally again.  I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it!"
All right! Let's do it!
"Mr. Marsh, you are on with all the world leaders."
"Alright men, check the ship."
"Hey Marsh, get in here!"
Looks like those alien cops were right. Guess you should call them back now.
"All right, let's get the cash put into boxes!"
What? There was no drill ordered!
The hell is going on?!
"Alright, troops. We depart for Afghanistan in five minutes! Let's move out!"
"Welcome to Afghanistan, troops! Get your gear ready and report to the barracks at o-nine hundred!"
Alright men! Grab your guns and your Bibles! We are going to get Miss Nicks back!
"We're coming, Miss Nicks! Hang on!"
We've done it! The Taliban is destroyed!
"Great job, troops! Once again we have killed our enemies!"
"The world is now safe, thanks to you. And so now, as promised, here is Fleetwood Mac with Stevie Nicks!"
"We've come to help you beat those Japs, boys!  There won't be anyone stopping this great ladder from being built today!  Alpha Team! Get that support structure up! Ciranom's Team! Get us photos and recon!"
"Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein."
Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.
These surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven.  Here we see what we believe to be a missile silo. And here  we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons.
Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull.
"Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must...  bomb heaven!"
"So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!"
"Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty. The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever. Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk. Two days ago our intelligence department came across this:  The AWESOM-O 4000. It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies. Our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas, eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler."
"No. If we got our hands on that robot, we could re-program it and turn it into a weapon!."
"Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand that the robot is from Japan! That means that the Japanese have more of them! And if the Japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before we do..."
"You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub.  Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles!  I want that robot!"
Are those arm and leg locks secure?
"Good. I don't want that robot mobile until I know what it's capable of. All right, power it on."
What's going on?
Stand by. Be ready to destroy it.
What's happening?
What? How can that be?
"Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist!"
"Who made you, robot?"
"But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?"
"Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too."
"Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don't forget you have a duty to your country,  Mr. Scientist!! I want that robot's memories and consciousness E-RASED, so we can take it back to Washington! GOT IT?!"
What the hell are you doing?!
Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!
"Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot. Maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence... is intelligence all the same, and we can learn from the robots. I think maybe one day we can all-  Hey, wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart?"
"Oh, and it, it smells, too!"
"Wow, kid, you're a little faggot!"
"Come on, people, we're running out of time! We need all Army helicopters to the Southern states for evacuation NOW!"
"Tell them that the government can't help them, but that we're very sorry. You know the plan, people! We can only evacuate citizens below this line!"
WHAT??
What??
Oh my God. Quick! Radio the helicopters!
"Don't worry, everyone. The government is here to save you."
Global warming didn't cause the Beaverton flood. We know now whose fault it is.  It was...  Crab people!
