...And Bear cried to Eagle-
What kid?
Who the hell are you?
Your mother?
"Cartman? Hohoho. Oh boy, I was worried there for a second.  Look, kid, I'm not your father."
"Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as, 'Bear with Wiiide Canyon.'"
"She is, 'Doe who cannot keep legs together.'"
Your mom's a slut
"Don't feel too bad. Your mom was just too drunk to remember what happened. Let me tell you.  We got tired of dancing, so we went off to find a private spot.  I knew that she wanted me, because she kept saying romantic things."
"Whoa, Helloooh!!"
Huh??  You gotta be kidding me.
He's the last person I saw with your mom that night.
