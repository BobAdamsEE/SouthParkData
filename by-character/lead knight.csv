Aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.
Stand aside!
Halt your evil plans!
I possess the Rune Stone of Undoing! Who is in charge here?
"Show your true form, Geldon, lest you be afraid! Your short time in this world is at an end!  Ach. The Rune Stone has no effect! You are not Geldon!"
"You will die anyway, for you have spread the word of curse!"
Ach!  oh.
Take this.
Eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Say not the word of curse!
He is too strong! We cannot fight him without the rune stone!
The rune stone! Point it towards Geldon!
