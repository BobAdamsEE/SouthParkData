We took a hundred beings from the planet Marklar and put them on an asteroid with sentient beings from the Horsehead Nebula. Ih-it's a riot!
"Gah, why?"
"Oh yeah, let's do haglar."
"Not on a Flakmar. Too crowded. Ohhh, Blackafelch!"
This place is fantastic!
"You've made it to a hundred episodes, you should be proud!"
"Oh, yeah!"
Oh yeah!
Ogh.
Good.
Woohoohoo! Yeah!
"Oh! Oh, that's it baby! You're getting my jagon hard!"
"Yeah, suck my jagon!"
"Oh, God. Eh eh, my head.  What did we do?"
"Oh God, we did suck each other's jagons! You kids won't tell anybody about this, right??"
They really got us by the nezmins
"Well, we've got a five o'clock with the Yurka producers.  Nice meeting you Earthlings. Bye!"
