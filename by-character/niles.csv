"Tom, tragedy stuck last night when mall security officer Males ""Happy"" Davis was beaten to death with this candy cane after telling a mother she couldn't line up for Black Friday until Thursday night. In honor of the slain mall security officer, the mall has officially decided to drop another 10% off Black Friday deals!"
"Tom, I'm standing in your doorway because we have a hot news story to report."
We just got a call from Bill Gates.  He says he can promise us a bigger war on Black Friday if we play along.
"That's right, Tammy. Let's not forget that having a bloodbath on Black Friday is good for the news. It's good for us. The bigger, the better."
"Right, Tom. Because you're sooo about integrity. Let's go.  Or maybe I should let everyone in the newsroom know what their two anchors are up to! Back to you!"
"Tammy, the excitement over Black Friday is peaking, and none other than Bill Gates himself has shown up to try to make it even bigger. "
We understand that you've donated some guns to the kids as well.
That was amazing sex. I enjoyed it immensely. How about you?
"You know, Microsoft has given kids who want XBoxes on Black Friday a lot of support. Seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided."
Black Friday is about to happen and it's not even gonna be a fight. That's bad for both of us. There must be something you can give to kids who want Sonys to make the fight more even.
"Yes, I think that will do nicely."
"Tom, we have breaking news from the South Park mall. In an effort to make sure everyone is prepared, the mall has decided to push Black Friday by one week!"
"The genius idea was proposed by George R. R. Martin, who also suggested ""Fuck it, let's push Thanksgiving to December 3rd."" For pushing the date, the mall is now reducing Black Friday prices to 96% off to the first hundred people inside the mall!  This is going to be a fucking bloodbath, Tom. There will be medical tents, ambulances, face-painting, no doubt a lot of people you know and love are going to die! "
"Tom, Black Friday is finally almost here, and as you can see behind me, holiday shoppers are really getting antsy. People have been waiting out here since midnight on Thanksgiving. They're cold, they're starving, and there's already been a lot of blood shed over these holiday deals. Joining me now is Rick Tellmore,  who's been out here for six days, and= your five year old son was eaten. Is that correct?"
What is it you're hoping to get when Black Friday does finally start?
"Now, some people might say that eating your child is not very Christmasy. What would you say to them?"
"No doubt Christmas is alive and well at the South Park Mall. Back to you, Tom."
"That's right Tom. Mall officials have said they are ready, and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbon.  This year's ribbon cutter is of course George R. R. Martin, who um, doesn't appear to have shown up yet,  but uhh, says he is on his way. Just like the dragons and zombies in his novels, he is on his way."
"Here we go, Tom. George R. R. Martin has finally arrived to cut the red ribbon. "
"Tom, the shopping frenzy is over, and it looks like Microsoft's new XBox One is this year's hot item. No doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console. Black Friday is over. There's been death, violence, horrible human behavior... and the big winner here, decidedly, is Channel 9 News."
