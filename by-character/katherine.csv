"I'm ready, Doctor."
"I'm sorry, doctor. I had air trapped in my vagina."
"But doctor, what if I have cancer?"
"Oh Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry."
Oh hello Regis.
"Well Reeg, it's like this: we think that queefing is a perfectly normal female bodily function. Why not have fun with it?"
"That's right. We've written all about it in our new feminist book, Eat, Pray, Queef."
"But those are just ginger snaps, Katie.  Could you get that, Katie?"
"Oh my God, they're famous!  Well hello sirs! It is such an honor to meet you! Oh Katie, I'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy."
"Oh certainly, though I feel we look a mess."
"Oh. Well I suppose if we're going to die, we should die by the hands of our idols."
We grew up watching you. You meant the world to us. We used to fantasize about pleasing you in all different ways. Know that it is an honor to die by your hand.
"Oh, this is a dream come true. I've always wanted to meet you, Phillip."
Oh dear.
"I'm not your sex toy, you fucking pig!"
"Fuck you, you don't fucking slap me!"
Get out! Get out both of you!  We never want to see you again!
Phillip!
