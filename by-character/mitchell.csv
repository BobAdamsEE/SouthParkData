"Oh hi, Miss Travis."
Are you... sure? They're working on a new episode right now.
"All right, I'll take him back. Follow me, little Danny.  You must be excited. Not many people get to meet our writing staff."
"Well, here we are. Danny, the Family Guy writing staff."
"They're manatees.  Gretchen and Flubber are from the Gulf of Mexico. Tinker, Pete and Lucy are from the Caribbean Sea."
"They really are brilliant creatures.  You see, the right side of the tank is filled with idea balls.  Each ball has a verb, noun, or pop culture reference written on it. There's millions of them.  The manatees choose an idea ball and swim it over to the joke combine on the other side of the tank.  Uh there goes Gretchen! She's comin' up with an idea. Oh, she came up with Gary Coleman.  The idea balls drop into the joke combine and form part of the new script.  Laundry Date Winning Mexico Gary Coleman. A perfect Family Guy joke! I can see it now!"
"When FOX censored the image of Mohammad last week, it also meant that the Mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. It made the manatees very upset. Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. He-here, I'll show you.  Keith?  All right all right, put it back in!  Manatees are very ethical writers. Either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. Anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees."
That isn't gonna work on them.
Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats.
"We don't know, Mr. President. They just stopped working."
"No sir, none of us did."
"Oh yeah, I think I've heard it, but go ahead."
"Ohhh ya ya ya? ""We set who free?"""
Where are they again?
"Well, I ain't never seen this before, neither. But I know one thing: when cows start gettin' together, it can't be good. They might start formin' a cult!"
I reckon.
"I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped!"
Maybe... maybe protect them from you?
"And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too!"
"That's it, I've had enough of this."
"I said, enough!"
Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop.
You're right. Maybe I'll see you around.
"Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks."
