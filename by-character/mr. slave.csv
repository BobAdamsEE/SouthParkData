"Heheh, oh Jesus Christ."
Hear hear!
Yeth Jethuth yeth!
"Ooooo, Jesus Christ."
This room's taken.
Hi kids. Hm.
Oh Jesus Christ.
Ugh.
Oh Jesus Christ.
Oh-oh. Oh it hurts.
AAH.
AAH.  AAH.  Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!
Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass.
"Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh!  Oooooh, Jesus Christ."
How'd it go?
The principal didn't fire you?
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
Well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody. What you need to do is let the parents see what kind of demented faggot you are.
"Oohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ."
"Almost. I just have to get through a su-  Uh-huc, Jesus Christ."
"Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess."
"Eugh, Jesus Christ."
"Yes, Mr. Garrison?"
Really? Why would you dream that I was being an asshole?
"I've got a little- Oof.  Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there?"
Oh! I should have never shoved all those poor animals up my ass!
"Yeah, Jesus Christ."
"Oooo, this could be kind of fun."
All donesy wunsy.
"Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me."
"Oh Jesus, will you look at those boots?"
Jesus! Jesus Christ!
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
Jesus Christ.
"Woohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ."
Oh Jesus! Jesus Christ!
How did you do that?
"Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?"
"Unh, Jesus  Christ."
Jesus Christ!
Oh! Jesus Christ!
"Oh, Jesus Christ"
Jesus.
"Oooooooooooh! Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ!"
"Oh, hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework?"
Thank you sweetie.
"Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember.  Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things."
"As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough."
"So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway?"
"A what?! For God's sake, where?!"
"Oh Jesus!  Kids, kids!"
"Girls, what on earth are you doing?"
"Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!"
"Paris Hilton is a nobody! She may have money, but she's a thoughtless, talentless lowlife!"
"Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing."
"Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life."
"Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay?"
"Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some ""partying"" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great."
"Jesus.  Ohoho, Jesus."
"People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore.  Being spoiled and stupid and whorish is supposed to be a bad thing, remember? Parents, if you don't teach your children that people like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised, where are they gonna learn it?! You have to be the-  ooohooho, Jesus Christ. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people."
No thanks.
I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought.
But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas!
"It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel!"
How can you say that?! You're gay too!
"Oh, Jesus Christ!"
"Mr. Garrison! Ohoh, Jezuth!"
"That's, that's wonderful, Mr. Garrison!"
Ooooo...
"Mr. Garrison, Al and I have been living together for a few months."
"No!  Mr. Garrison, there's something you should know. Al and I are getting married."
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
We're getting married right after the bill passes on Saturday.
"Okay, that's enough. Out, Mr. Garrison."
"Oh my God, you're just saying that because you're jealous."
We wanna be treated equally!
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
