Give me a hard line to the phone in that house!
"Don't worry, I'm a negotiator. It's my job to talk to freaks like this and bring about a peaceful resolution using clever psychology."
"Hello, my name is Mike. I'm a negotiator. Is it okay if I talk to you?"
"I'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. You want that, right?"
"How about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other."
"Well, how about you send out one of the calves?"
"Just one, that's all we want."
"What? I, I can't do that."
"No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuh, you're right. What reason do you have to trust me? I'm just a guy from Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? Just a blue-collar guy like your dad."
"Oh. All right, fine, son of a gun, let me see what I can do."
Okay. Up a little... left a little...  Almost there.
We're giving the boys some guns in return for our calves
"Hey, this is a negotiation process, okay? Did you people go to negotiator school? No, you didn't!  Get them on the line for me!"
"Alright, you see that? I keep my end of the bargain."
"Well, ha- how about you send out two calves?"
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Damnit, I'm losing them.  Okay, I'm sorry. Just send out one calf."
What do you have in mind?
"A little to the left...  Okay, that's good. A little to the right."
"Stand down, ma'am! Stand down! This is a delicate process! I've almost earned their trust!"
How are we doin'?
"Weh ah I did manage to get the FDA to officially change the word ""veal"" to ""tortured baby cow."""
But I couldn't get you North and South Dakota.
"Now, now please can, can we get you to come out?"
"All right, everythng has worked out. The boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them."
"Yes. All we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to Denver International Airport, where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to Mexico."
"And they want the guy that plays Mr. Worf on ""Star Trek"" to drive the truck.  In full makeup."
"All right, all right, I'll give you that. But in return, I want three staples."
