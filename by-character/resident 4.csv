What about him?
He's a tourist and he knows everything! We have to kill him!
"Finish his ceremony?! We are at war, David! I have lived on this island for ten years. Ten years! Every July and part of August! And I can tell you all that what we are about to face from the haoles is nothing short of genocide!"
"If he wants to be one of us, then he must face the challenge!"
He still has yet to make the turn!
I told you a haole couldn't do it!
We can't fight without chi-chis!
We can't hold out here any longer!
