"Hold!  This is it, Time Child.  The old museum of technology, abandoned long ago. Let's get what you want, Time Child, and get out of here."
"All right, Time Child, we've filled our side of the bargain. Now return with us to Otter Bay."
NOOOO!
"SCIENCE DAMN YOU, TIME CHILD!"
"The United Atheist Alliance has taken the bait! Soon they will send their ships out to destroy our decoy clam fields! And while their ships are away, the United Atheist League intends to attack them! Our plan has worked perfectly! For when the United Atheist League attacks the United Atheist Alliance, we will charge in and kill them all! Our Science, our answer to the Great Question shall prevail!"
"And I will personally kill the Time Child, and eat his entrails on my tummy!"
"Wise One, our answer to the Great Question is the only one based on good science."
"They are not a logical race, Wise One! They go around chopping down trees for tables, when they have perfectly good tummies to eat on. How logical is that?!"
Yes. And we're attacking both of you!
"Then accept our answer to the Great Question, and we will withdraw."
No! Allied Atheist Alliance! That way it has three A's! That is the logical choice!
"Don't worry, my son. When you return to your time you will merge with your other self. It's all very Zen."
Of course there's war. The stupid French-Chinese think they have a right to Hawaii.
