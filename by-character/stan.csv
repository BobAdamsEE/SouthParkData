"You guys, you guys! Chef is going away."
Forever.
"Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club."
"Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend."
I'll get it.
He's back!
But are you back for good?
"Right. Uh, see ya."
"Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little."
"Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good."
What?
What??
"Dude, what are you saying??"
...WHAT??
"No, he's not."
"No, he's not."
NO!
"No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!"
Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
NO!!
No!
Knew what?
"You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good."
"Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr."
"No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children."
Having sex with women.
This isn't working.
"Come on guys, we might as well go."
"Chef, we're leaving."
He's remembering.
Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
"Oh Jesus, here we go."
We don't wanna hear it.
Immortal.
"Yeah, it's way, way more retarded."
We're not leaving without Chef.
"No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!"
"Come on, Chef!"
We made it!
"Chef, come on!"
"Chef, we love you."
NO!
Oh my God... They killed Chef.
"Come on, let's go."
Oh hey Kyle.
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
Yeah?
Going away party? What do you mean?
Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!
Where's the going-away party?
Kyle? Kyle!
What?!
Kyle! Du-what is going on?!
"Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend."
Well... Maybe they'll change.
Nooo!
I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
"Come on, people. Come on, people now."
"I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways."
"Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!"
"You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow."
"Come on, people. Come on, people now."
"Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now."
"We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now"
"Come on, everybody be people now"
"Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now."
Yeah.
Ow!
What?!
Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
Smug?
"No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!"
"Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly."
What is that?
George Clooney's acceptance speech?
What about San Francisco?
I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
No...
What?
Kyle!
"Dude, what happened??"
"Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead."
What?? What??
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
"Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?!"
Sso?
"Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??"
They censored the image of Mohammad? How?
"Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy."
What? What's the big deal?
"Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!"
The hell's going on now?!
Does this mean we don't have school all week?
"Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses."
To Los Angeles?
"Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand."
Yeah.
"Dad, this is stupid."
Who?
"Pass it to me, Cartman?"
"Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!"
"Oh, hey Dad."
"Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig."
"He could be half bear, half manpig."
"But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends."
Hello?
Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.
I know.
"Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy."
"No, no, it's not that."
"Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you."
"Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him."
"...Yes, I'm serial."
"Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go."
"Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado."
NO.
"Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now."
"Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group."
Oh no!
Help!
Help!
Me??
Maybe there's another way out of here.
"There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep."
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
"Dude, he's really sick."
Huh? What? Have they come for us?
"Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?"
"How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere."
"Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!"
Cartman?
"I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!"
"Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!"
Kyle! No!
Agh.
"Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!"
"Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor."
You can't stay here.
"Dude, have you lost more weight?"
"Dude, we're not killing your mom."
Where am I supposed to get a gun?
I'm not shooting anybody.
Dude! We've been waiting forever!
"H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something."
What?!
"I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak."
"All right, sorry guys. So where to now?"
Oh crap! It's that guy again!
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
"Oh my God, he killed Kenny!"
"Whoever he is, he is one tough badass."
"Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!"
Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!
"Ddue, we have to try."
"Come on, let's do this!"
Look! There he is!
Dad??
"Dad, get off our teamspeak line!"
"That's it, screw this game!"
"Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time."
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
I'm in.
15 agility.
'K.
That's Ã¼bercool.
"Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire."
"Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us."
"Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?"
"Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad!"
Hurry dude!
"Kyle, you have to keep playing."
We can't do this without you now! Come on!
"You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!"
"Dude, I'm almost dead."
I've gotta heal.
Dad? Not now!
"Dad, how did you get that?!"
Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...
I got it!
Dad!
"Dad, no!  You killed my father."
Dad? Dad?
"I know you do, Dad."
We did it!
Yeah.
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
Got it.
A wall toilet for peeing in.
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
"Yeah, at least one-fourth."
Kyle!
"Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??"
Well why did you have to involve me??
"All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9-11."
"Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9-11, right?"
That's all I needed.
"Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9-11."
"Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?"
JESUS CHRIST!!
He was right. You DID cause 9-11.
Why?!
Is the whole government in on this?
Kyle! Run!
"All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw."
"Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time."
"Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that?"
What who said?
Oh God!
Who are you?
Aw Jesus...
"How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!"
It was all planned out!
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
"Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?"
Yuh.
Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.
Sure dude.
"Dude, what's the matter?"
...Wow.
"Dude, I really don't see a problem."
"Go ahead, Kyle, do it."
Dad! Dad!
"If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??"
It does work!!
"We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls."
It's still three weeks.
"Dude you don't look so good, Cartman."
Do what?
"Dude, no way."
Well there could still be a god.
Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
I wasn't talking about spaghetti.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day."
"My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore."
Yeah. Why?
What??
"Hey, hey! What are you doing?!"
Yes!
"No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!"
"No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!"
"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-"
"I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?"
"Look, I really need my bike."
What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
...Yeah?
Me?
"Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in."
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
"All right, fine, go ahead."
"S- hold it a while, okay?"
When you shoot the puck to another player.
"All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie."
Why not?!
"What, you got asthma or something?"
What?
"Ah, it's okay. Don't cry."
"Oh Jesus, can we just practice?"
NO!
Hey.
Jesus Christ.
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
"I'm not playing, I'm coaching."
What are you talking about?
I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.
I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed.
"All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice."
Oh
Ohhh.
... I don't know.
"No, I think you oughta."
"Oh uh, hey Nelson."
"Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?"
"Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?"
Ogh.
"Goddammit, dude, I don't know."
"No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?"
"Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right?"
"No- dude, I told you I can't do that."
Okay.
"Coach, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?"
"All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him."
Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
"Let's go, Park! Come on!"
Get near the puck!
"Tie? Well, what does that mean?"
Hello?
How are you feeling?
"Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?"
Oh boy.
But what can I do?
"Well, ah, I mean..."
"Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em."
"Well, sure we can."
"Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?"
They're not gonna kill us.
"Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end."
Hey that's right. We need a ringer.
"It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise."
"Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now."
"All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!"
Huh?
Sso then we win?
"Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!"
But it isn't supposed to end like this!
Play the Red Wings?
Jesus Christ!  Stop! Stop this!
"Hey, can they do that??"
Oooo.
Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
No he's not.  Is he?
"I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-"
"Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?"
"Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it."
"Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that."
Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
"Well, yeah."
"Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!"
He told my dad he was...
"Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that ""little person"" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word."
God dammit!
"Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!"
I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
What the hell do you want from me?!
Then stop being mad!
What was his point?
"Dude, I don't get it."
Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
"Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it."
Yeah. I totally don't get it.
"Come on, let's go."
What'cha do to Butters this time?
"Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?"
You are now.
You can't!
"Because it's really, really funny."
That isn't funny.
"Aw man, I've got H O R S now."
"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!"
What do you think happens if you do have it?
Somebody in this class?
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
Yeah... Or you.
"Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!"
You had head lice?
"Dude, we totally got let out of school."
Russian?
So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling.
"Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!"
"Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?"
"Right, so, why do we color eggs?"
"Yeah, but why?"
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
"You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information."
I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
"All right, can you explain to me what's going on?"
What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!
I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
"No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this!"
Mom? Dad?  Anybody home?
Dad! You've gotta help me!
Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!
"They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?"
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
Does Mom know about this?
I don't understand!
"Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?"
So what is the secret of Easter?
Grandpa's in it too?
"Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?"
You mean the old Galveston Lodge?
Must I?
Hi Grandpa.
...Stan.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I wanna know already."
Where am I supposed to go?
Jesus Christ!
Oh no...
Help.
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
"Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?"
Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men?
My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
Just bread...
He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
He looks like a guy.
But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
They found me!
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
"What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help."
"First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!"
"Okay, fine."
"You said ""hand over the bunny."""
"Hey, what the hell!"
"Jesus, you did answer my prayer!"
No! No!
Snowball!
All right Jesus!
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
"Uh oh, this isn't good."
No ma'am.
"Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend."
"Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?"
We don't?
"Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that."
"That's it, that's the whole story?"
"You guys, school starts in ten minutes!"
"Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?"
Again?
These guys are pretty good.
"Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?"
"Well dude, what are we supposed to do?"
"Yeah, it's all set."
"That was a sweet idea, Kyle."
"Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?"
"I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on."
"Kyle, what were you thinking?"
"Dude, it's our dads."
"Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents."
Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
Over here!  Jump down! Go!
"Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house."
Are you the head of Homeless Studies?
We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
"Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!"
What the hell happened here?
"We, just came to ask a question."
"Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem."
"Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!"
What?
"But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!"
"Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!"
"No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!"
"All right, I'm turning around"
"Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle."
No way!
"No, never."
"That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?"
"Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready."
"Gee, thanks a lot, Dad."
"You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand."
"Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?"
"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap."
That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
"Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold."
"Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?"
"All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2."
Agh!
I take it back!
You're not number two!
What is wrong with that guy?
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
So Bono's newest record is a lie!
So?
He's the record.
"Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours."
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
Dude.
"That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit."
"Dad, are you all right?"
Dude...
Cool.
Where'd he go?
"Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place."
...What do you know about the leprechaun?
Who the hell are you?
"Come on, guys."
What is this place?
Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
Butters.
Hello?
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
Yeah! How'd you know?
Why?
"Dude, do you really have to do it?"
What is this place?
"Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland."
"Dude, we don't remember."
No.
Your what?
"If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?"
That's not very imaginative.
The Imagination song?
Imagina-he-hey-
"Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid."
"Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation."
"Dude, you did make a deal..."
"Wait, woodland critters..."
Get them out of there!
Tell them to get away now!
KYLE!!
Hello?  Hello? Anybody?
Hello?
Hello? Can anybody hear me?
"Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you."
...Oh that makes sense.
I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
Kyle? What's happening?
What?! You can't let them do that!
"Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!"
"No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon."
"No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place."
So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
The Chosen One?
"Kyle? Kyle, what happened?"
What??
"Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!"
Well you have to convince them they are real!
"Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you."
Kyle!
"Dude! How did you do that, Butters?"
Dude.
"Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us!"
Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!
"Yeah, that's stupid, Dad."
"Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time."
"Dude, we are total rock stars now!"
Hang on.
Yeah?
"Yeah, we did."
"Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!"
That'd be awesome!
"Wow, this is a huge party."
"Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News!"
"Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!"
Are you serious??
"Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday."
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
"Yeah dude, that's almost impossible."
Really? That'd be sweet.
"What, you mean, Kyle?"
"But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system."
"Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?"
"Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play ""John the Fisherman""?"
"...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick."
"This is um, Thad Jarvis."
"Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while."
"I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part."
"Don't put this all on me, Kyle!"
"You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-"
"Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!"
"Let's just do this, all right?"
"It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out."
Huh?
Hero-Heroin Hero?
And there's no score? No crowds?
"Dude, this is awesome."
Ugh. Damint.
"Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!"
Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
"Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!"
"We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!"
"You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!"
"I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time!"
Man...
"Just, just a little."
"I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!"
No problem.
"Huh? What, uh?"
The dragon. Where did it go?
"No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!"
I just wanna find something else to play.
"I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?"
"Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?"
"Please, ih ih, it won't take long."
"I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better."
"Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there."
That isn't it at all.
"I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend."
Yeah.
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
"What, you mean it?"
"Then let's go, dude!"
"All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell?"
"Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!"
"No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!"
"You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad!"
"Mom, will you get Dad out of here?"
That's it?
"Dude, Butters, calm down."
"Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?"
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
"And then Token, and then me."
"Cartman, lay off! You're next to last."
"Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?"
"Who cares what dumb girls think, right?"
Uh Wendy. Could I talk to you?
Just for a minute. Over here.
"Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made."
"The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?"
So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
"Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?"
NO.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
"That didn't sparkle with her, did it?"
What's going on?
"Jesus, dude!"
"Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something."
"Kyle! Kyle, don't!"
"The list was a forgery, Kyle!"
It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list.
"It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up."
Wendy!
Wendy!
"Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list."
"Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?"
...Abe Lincoln?
"Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh!"
What's going on? Are we in trouble?
...What?
"Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot."
"Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?"
"He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic."
"Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now..."
"Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks."
What did he do?
"Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?"
And she's at a hotel in our town.
"Butters, don't be such a pussy."
Oh no.
"Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids."
I told you that would work!
"Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?"
"Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else."
You do?
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
"Oh, thank God."
"We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry."
Oh no!
"Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself."
"Yeah, of course."
Jesus Christ!
"Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can."
"Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse."
What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
"No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!"
She doesn't have any lips!
"We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace."
I know where.
We want three tickets to the North Pole.
"We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt."
Oh no.
"Dude, they're never gonna let us through."
"It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon."
"You doing okay, Ms. Spears?"
Oh no!
"Come on, Britney!  Come on, come on!"
"Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?"
Sacrificed? For what?
"All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!"
No wait.
"That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?"
"Yeah, this is not gonna work."
Do you feel anything?
What titties?
"Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes."
"Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today."
"Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed."
"Kenny, you home?"
"Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life."
"Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you."
"Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up."
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
"Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself."
What the hell is he talking about?
I'm sure glad that's over with.
You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
What the hell kind of flowers are those?
"Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!"
"God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!"
It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy.
What'd they say?
This is going great!
"Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money."
It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
"Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!"
"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with."
...Yeah.
"Dude, wanna do some math problems?"
"Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things"
Aw man!
What the hell?
What?
My Internet's not working either.
I'm getting on it first.
"Kyle, I need to use your Internet"
What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.
"Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!"
What's so funny about that?
"Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee."
All right!
Eight fifty one.
Hey! Mom!
It's gotta be our turn soon.
Dad?
Ughh.
"Naw, I'm with Wendy."
"Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her."
Sounds like police sirens.
I don't know.
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
What?!
"Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!"
This is not the time for that!
"Dude, do you understand what's going on here?!"
"Wait, you have guns here?"
Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice.
"Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away."
"Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich.."
I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
"I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe."
"If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?"
"Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?"
He done killed yer pahr.
I know.
"Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?"
"Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go."
"Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on."
"There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there."
How?
"You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go."
God damn it.
Let's get out of here!
Come on!
Oh God!
I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle!
COME ON LET'S GO!
JUST RUN!!
Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
"Let's just go, Let's just go!"
"Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same."
"Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it."
I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were!
Indiana Jones! All right!
"You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!"
No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?!
Indy!
"No, stop! Raape!"
You aren't alone.
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.
Wh-why?
Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
But they raped Indiana Jones!
"So, what now?"
What?
I guess so.
What am I supposed to do about it?
What?
Yeah?
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you.
Really?
"Dude, there's nothing I can do about it."
"Ugh, I'm glad that's over with."
"Dude, we never thought you were cool."
"Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately?"
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
I gotta get home for dinner.
God!
I'm outta here; see ya guys.
They're in London too?
Where's dad?
Why?
Oh Jesus Christ!
"You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night."
"So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?"
Over two hundred bucks.
"Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that!"
"Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer."
Yeah!
"Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars?"
"There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs."
"All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!"
"Ya see, Craig?"
"Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first."
"This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?!"
"Come on, guys."
Jesus Christ!
"Hey, back off!"
"Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?"
"No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-"
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
"This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band."
"We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money."
We we speak English!
Help you how?
"Kyle, calm down."
One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic.
"Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now."
Yes!
"All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?"
"We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!"
Guinea pigs?
"Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government."
"None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!"
"Dude, what is this place?"
"Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!"
Let's see what's in there.
"It might be a way out, Craig!"
"You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings."
"I know, a-and look."
And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then...
"Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?"
"Let's head over this way, guys."
Wow.
"All right, let's go."
"Wait, whattaya mean no?"
"Dude, we we have to go check this out."
"'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is."
"Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!"
"Craig, dude, wait up."
"Hey look, there's something here."
"No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands."
Jesus Christ!
"No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?"
"Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint."
Jesus Christ...
"Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here."
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
"Dad Dad, we have a problem."
"No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital."
"Dude, he's wasted."
"Dad, what are you doing?!"
"Hey, there's some people."
"Let go of my face, asshole!"
Why does that matter?
So where's the other doctor?
"Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired."
What's High School Musical 1 and 2?
I have no idea.
Who the hell is that?
"Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out..."
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it."
"All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this."
"Okay, good."
But you didn't die?
I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
Stop.
"Uh, Wendy?"
"Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should."
"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way."
It is?
Really?
"What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!"
"No, fuck off. I'm not doing it."
"Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit."
"Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed."
"Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy."
You don't like doing it?
Basketball?
"Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!"
"Yes, you can. What's stopping you?"
"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!"
"When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team."
Sweet.
Aww!
"Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!"
"Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good."
"You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate."
"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!"
"Ah, shit."
"You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it."
"I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake."
"You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?"
"That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids"
"God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now?

"Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part."
"Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!"
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
"Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you."
"That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball"
"Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance."
Try to do what you wanna do!
involves needing scissors and glue!
Huh?
But the girls like singing and dancing.
"But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!."
"No, I'm on the Japanese side."
"Dude, what?"
What?
"Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!"
"I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me."
What?
"Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader."
"All right, come on, guys."
"Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny!"
"Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend."
"Oh, boy."
A B.J.?
"Yeah, dude, that's gross."
So how did it go last night?
"Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-"
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
"Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!"
"Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude."
"You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?"
"You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him."
What?
"All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die!"
Excuse us. Excuse us.
"Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!"
"Dude, who the hell did that?  Hwa?"
We... don't work for any-body.
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
Who's the Coon?
Not really.
"Dude, what the hell?"
"Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too."
"Do I really have to do this, Dad?"
But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
"I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years."
"Uh, what?"
What's all gone?
What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.
"Well, what can I do to get back my money-?"
I just opened an account.
"No, you just lost it all!"
Hey!
Dad?!
"Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?"
"Yeah, I think I get it."
"Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought."
What?
So?
Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
I wanna return this Margaritaville.
"No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it."
What?
Wall Street?
So?
"'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?"
My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
It does?
So I can return it to a bank?
What?!
Aargh!
I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
Nnnaaargh!
Really?  Thank you.
What?!
Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
"No, dude, that doesn't make sense!"
"What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!"
Oh boy!
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
"You tell 'em, Cartman!"
What?
"Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming."
"It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?"
"Mom, gross!"
"Stop it, Mom!"
I'm going too.
"Yeah it's different, Mom!"
"Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny."
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
No way! We did it?!  Yeah!!
"Mom, we didn't mean..."
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
What's going on?
"Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?"
What is that?
"Oh no, he didn't."
Tells?
"Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-"
"It's uh, Marsh."
Yes I do.
Yeah?
"Aw crap, Dad!"
Alien?
What does it want?
Dad they aren't here for that.
"Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit."
Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
"Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean."
"Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated."
Kill the alien?
"No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen."
Dad?
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
"No, Dad-"
"Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?"
"'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy!"
"The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit."
"This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow."
"What are you talking about, dude?"
"No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia."
You really think he'll die in Somalia?
"Dude, I don't even know who that is."
Are you guys fucking serious?
"It's gonna be alright, Kyle."
"Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood."
"Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?"
Uh oh.
"You're dead, Mr. Jackson!"
Accept it!
"Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!"
"Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no..."
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
Yeahhhh!
"Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important."
"Dude, the two male judges love her."
"Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time."
Woohoo!
"Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!"
"Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses."
"Butters, you're the one doing all this?"
Butters. Dude!
You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!
"Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!"
I'm having the best time!
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class!
Why did they have us put on long underwear.
Yeah!
"Yeah, what are you? A child molester?"
"Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked."
Yup.
We'll see about that!
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
What?!
"If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!"
"Irene, you said you loved me!"
"Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight."
"Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!"
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
Vince McMahon is coming to see us?
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
"Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you."
What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam.
Yeah?
He's right.
"Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token."
"And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers."
"Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts."
"Yeah yeah, not bad."
"Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling."
"He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-"
"Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?"
"Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?"
"It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene."
"No, you can't possibly mean that-!"
"Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that."
"When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!"
Dude.
What??
"Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't..."
Wow cool.
"Yeah, this is gonna be awesome."
What the hell is that?
"Dad, why did they do that?"
"Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand."
"No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins."
"So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?"
"It seems like everyone has an attitude of ""that's just the way they are"" or ""that's just the way it is""! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!"
You're not?
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
"You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit!"
"Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?"
Really?  People who are doing something?
Then that's where I belong.
Sweet!
Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!
"Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff."
"Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!"
"Wait, that's it?"
"Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat."
I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
What you assholes acted like you were doing?
Wait for it... wait for it... NOW!
"No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales."
"...No, I don't care about the show."
I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
"Screw this, I gotta get back to work!"
Would you mind stepping back a little?
"No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers."
"Oh no, no, NO."
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
"You said ""Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"""
"Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!"
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
"As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt!"
"Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!"
What?
"What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales."
Screw this! Turn hard to port!
"Dude, fuck you!"
What was that?
It's like... they know.
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
"I, I can't, I can't believe it."
Will you stop that?
"Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!"
You speak English.
Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
"Ummm, where did you get that picture?"
"Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-"
"Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?"
"Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me."
"Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow."
"Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day."
Aww! Not those guys again!
God! Shut up!
God damn it God damn it!
"All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it."
"Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all."
"...That makes perfect sense, Butters."
"Yes, now get out of here."
"Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?"
Oh that's good.
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
"Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!"
"Really nice work, guys."
"Yeah, we did that!"
Gay people?
"Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?"
Aw crap!
"Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay."
"Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?"
Then you're not a fag.
I don't know.
"All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?"
"Right. But you're not thinkin' ""Oh, he's a homosexual,"" you're thinkin' ""Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."""
"""Bike-curious""! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!"
"Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days."
Aw crap!
We can fix this!
"That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition."
"Ohh, it all makes sense now."
There's fags everywhere!
"Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags."
"Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does."
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
"...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags."
We did it! Yeah!
"Today, we've made history."
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
"""Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end""!"
"""Or does she?"""
"Hey hey, stop reading that!"
"Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!"
"Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?"
Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
What?!
"Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?"
"Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now."
We're here! It's the water park!
"We got it, Dad."
"Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?"
"Dude, this is awesome."
Okay.
"Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat."
"Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it."
"Yeah, they do, Kyle."
"Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath."
"After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?"
"Aw come on, Kyle."
Not everybody pees in pools.
Not today... yet.
"Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?"
"Dude, where have you been?"
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
I'm gonna go on the slides.
"This is sweet, huh Kenny?"
"Aaaah!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
"Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!"
Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
"Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!"
"...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom."
"Come on, dude, you've gotta swim."
Not... all the time.
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
"Kyle, come on!"
I don't know.
Who are you?
"...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower."
"That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?"
"Just drink the pee, Kyle."
"Come on, dude!"
"All right, they finally came for us."
"Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle."
What are you guys doing?
"Aw dude, I clocked you!"
"Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron."
Hit A and X together.
"I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up."
"Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense."
"Yeah, where's all the fighting?"
"Yeah, golf is stupid again."
All right!
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
"I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said ""shit"" and ""fuck"" a few times."
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
"Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book."
"Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!"
"Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!"
"Well dude, somebody has got to go down!"
"Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!"
"Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters."
"Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!"
What? Hey!
"Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole!"
God-damnit!
"More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!"
Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
"What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!"
What?
There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!
I can't believe they won't ban our book!
"Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one."
"So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!"
"Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought."
You can't be serious! You people like this?!
"God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!"
"They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!"
"Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television."
Hey it looks different.
A what?
What'd they say?
"The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat."
"Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer."
"Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?"
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
"Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?"
"Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!"
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
Who?
You guys are retarded I'm playing Xbox.
"Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to."
"No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it."
"...Dad, you are my friend."
"Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!"
I just wanna do my homework!
"Alright, Dad, I'll add you!"
What?
"...Um, no?"
Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
"Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry."
How?
"Okay, I'm sorry!"
"""Edit profile. Basic... settings"" Jesus Christ!"
"...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!"
"Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend."
"Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?"
"Sure dude.  Dude, what's the matter?"
What?
"Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you."
NO.
"Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!"
Ah fuck.
Okay it says I'm at your farm.
"'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends."
What?
...I have no idea.
Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old!
Fine!
I don't know you!
"...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-"
"No. NO! Screw this! You know what? ""Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile."" There! ""Delete Profile""!  ""You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel"" Proceed!  ""Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No."" Yes! ""Are you totally sure?"" Yes!"
You can't let me do that? What are you talking about?
"Delete Profile! ""Are you totally sure? Yes or-"" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck?"
Profile? I'm not a profile.
AAH.
"'Scuse me, my name is-"
"Eh hey, could you tell me how I-"
Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!
Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
"No, I seriously don't want any more friends."
Okay I'll be your friend.
Awww!
Why oh oh?
Yahtzee?
Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
Yahtzee.
I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
Oh yeah? I can try!
"You're an asshole, Kyle!"
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
Dude! Fuck your crops!
Where?
Son of a bitch!
Jesus Christ.
Has anybody seen my stupid profile?!
"Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh!"
Oh...
"What do you want from me, dude?!"
Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously?
Yahtzee.
Yahtzee. Sixes.
Awgh!  Oh thank God.
"My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else."
"Fuck off, Dad."
"Oh God, you guys, really? This again?"
You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff!
"Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!"
Then why are you packing fudge?
"Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge."
For what?
But dude-
I have no idea...
Aww... he was packing fudge!
"It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-"
Ooooooo...
I saw him once.
"Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends."
"No, dude, it was totally fine."
"Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln..."
"Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour."
"Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!"
Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
"Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!"
"What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck."
"No, you can't even show his feet."
"Muhammad, are you okay?"
They want his power?
"Yeah, we said we'd take care of him."
We made a promise... to Jesus!
"Dude, we can't do that"
"It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!"
"Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad."
When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
"If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!"
"Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!"
Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
...Yeah.
"Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!"
"Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!"
"Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad."
"Come on, guys, we're running out of time!"
That's not cool!
"We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!"
"Oh crap, the gingers!"
What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!
Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back.
Yeah.
"Oh dude, look.  Hey, Cartman..."
"Yeah dude, we, we know what it means."
"Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back."
"We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!"
We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
"Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!"
"There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined!"
We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!
"A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody."
Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
"Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?"
"Cartman, dude, what's wrong?"
Why not?
"Cartman, tell us."
"Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can."
"Dude, noo, you- you don't know that."
"Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!"
"Dude, you are so retarded!"
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
"They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, ""Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."""
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
"No, uh, it just explains a lot."
"Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is."
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
"Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?"
"Dude, what are you doing?"
Try to find a way past it!
"Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?"
Why?
Dude.
"Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal."
"I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling ""Muff cabbage,"" what's muff cabbage?"
A note?
We need to talk.
"Is something wrong, Wendy?"
My locker?
Are you serious?
Well it's just a little messy.
Aw come on.
"Yeah, alright."
"What, come on, it's not that bad."
"My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away."
"Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box."
"Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-"
"Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-"
"Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that."
"Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-"
"Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down?"
"Well no, don't throw that out."
"No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich!"
I don't... I don't know.
"Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... ""hoarding."""
"Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?"
"Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?"
"Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-"
"What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?"
What the hell's going on?!
Mr. Mackey.
"Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?"
"Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!"
"Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me."
I'm working on it!
"Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office!"
Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
Ohhhhhhh.
"Wait wait, where the hell are we now?"
"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!"
"Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey."
Dad? Is that you?
Where are you?
"The hell are you doing, dad?"
Did you come here to help me?
"Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!"
DAD!
Aaaaaagh!
Who's that?
What the fuck?
"Mr. Mackey, stop running!"
"Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time."
"Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding."
Shut up!
You can do it Mr. Mackey.
What the hell?
Who are you people?
"Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?"
...Well then why aren't we waking up?
"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!"
I think I have a better idea.
"Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with."
"Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!"
Who's Captain Hindsight?
Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
"Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?"
"Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys."
"It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf!"
"Dad, what are you doing?"
Aw crap.
Can I have a Pop Tart?
"Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels."
"You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!"
Awww what?!
"No, dad! No!"
"Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!"
"Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!"
Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
"Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!"
"Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!"
"Dad, what are you doing?"
Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
"No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!"
He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
"That's stupid, Cartman."
"You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded."
"...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you."
"Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up."
"Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream!"
"Hey no, no. All you people get out of here."
"Let me see your iPad, Cartman."
What?
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
I do.
We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
Oh boy.
For what?
"Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses."
"Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time."
"Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom."
69ingchipmunks@me.com
"Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement."
"No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend."
I think Verizon.
"Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?"
"Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy."
"Oh man, really?"
Can we go now?
We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
What the hell are they gonna do to us?
"Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work."
What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore.
"Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-"
"'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot."
What the hell are you doing?!
"Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?"
We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
A what?
That's it! Hurry! Gooo!
Okay we got it! We got it!
"Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with."
My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
"No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife."
"Dude we're, we're just trying to eat."
Yeah.
"Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?"
"Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right."
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
You just did that to everybody in class!
Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup.
I know! This is awesome!
What?
"Aw dude, that's so sad."
"Awww dude, awwww."
"Go long, Token! Go go!"
"Wow, really?"
Doing what?
...Dude.
...You sound like Cartmam.
"Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too."
McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God.
My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ.
It's what?
"Kyle, Kyle! Look."
Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
"Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters."
"Oh thanks, dude."
"Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?"
"Mom, I'm 10 years old now."
We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
That sounds like shit!
"I know, Mom. I love you too."
"It's okay, Mom. I understand."
'Night.  Haha.  Ugh.  What the hell?
Hey dudes.
"Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?"
"Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle."
"No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me."
It... kind of sounds like shit.
"No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?"
That doesn't sound like shit to you?
"And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me."
"Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit."
I just turned 10.
So this is normal?
Sounds like shit.
Uh that sounds like shit too.
"Yeah dude, it's just shit."
They both look the same.
No.
They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
Oh no.
Hey guys.
He said I have cynicism?
"Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit."
"Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?"
How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
"Aw, dude, this looks like shit."
"It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit."
"Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit."
"What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever."
Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
"Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit."
I thought you guys were sick!
"Dude, you totally lied to me!"
Where were you guys going?!
Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
You guys... don't wanna be around me?
"Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you."
I won't say a word.
Oh shit.
"Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?!"
Awww God!
"Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry."
How can you say that looks good?!
Ugh.
But it's just crap.
"Oh come on, people!"
"Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry."
Me?! Did you see that shit?!
Hang on guys!
Kyle?
"I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?"
"God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up!"
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
"How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy?"
"Wait, it's not a real illness?"
"Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!"
Yeah.
Who are you people?
Huh?
Aliens?
Because of aliens?
Yeah I'm ready!
Ahhhh!  Oh coool!
Adam Sandler's funny.
Kyle!
"Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!"
"Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit."
"But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on!"
"You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!"
"...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept?"
"Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!"
"Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you."
I feel like total shit.
The rock creatures?
"Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any..."
Ugh God.
Aughah.
...Enchirito?
What? You guys are aliens?
"Dude, I don't know!"
I'm not friends with him.
"No, no, we don't hang out anymore."
"Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!"
I don't know!
"Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger."
How do you guys make them so yummy?
"Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger"
"No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me."
"Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!"
"Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying."
Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
"No, I'm done with that!"
"I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will."
"Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited."
What?
"No, dad, no. No, please!"
"No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn."
"...K, coming."
"Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader."
"You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco."
Base!
"So, so then, so then the pope says, ""Maybe you should go check the toilet."""
"Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game."
What are you talking about?
"Yeah, I think he was. Wait."
Butters!
"Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks."
What?
What about him?
Turn it up.
No way.
The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
"Come on dude, it's pretty funny."
"Yeah dude, that's pretty funny."
"Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her ""soft-serve Simon."""
"Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!"
I wouldn't care.
What?
"Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!"
How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.
"No, I was telling Kenny he would like it."
"Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this."
"This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle."
"Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!"
"Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!"
What? How do you know?
We only have music class on Thursday.
Oh I'm ready!
Don't let him get away!
What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
Stop that rat!
Knock it off!
"You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon."
Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?
Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?
"Come on, guys!"
"Quick, we need something to carry him in!"
"We just need to borrow him, kid."
"Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!"
"Whoa whoa wait, wait!"
Can't this thing go any faster?
"Craig, are we still clear?"
"Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!"
"Stop right there, you little rat!"
Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.
"Come on, Larry!  Dude, why does this happen every time?"
"Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off!"
"Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?"
No. Dad. Please don't do this!
"Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?"
God this sucks!
"Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!"
Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
"That's what we mean by ""grow up"" dude! Stop being a baby!"
"Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver."
Yeah.
"Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?"
"Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned."
"Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!"
"Dude, what the hell?"
"We all have to do this report together, dude."
"Dude, it is called History Channel."
...What?
'bout what?
"That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?"
"Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV."
"I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?"
I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
Dude!
"Yeah, go on dude!"
I didn't think so.
Who's this?
"Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing."
"It's cool dude, we understand."
"Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before."
Did you hear anything more about what happened?
We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
Really?
"Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny."
...What the fuck?!
"Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde!"
They are trying to save Clyde's mom.
We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
So then we can't sue him?
"Wow, really?!"
How expensive?
Yeah.
So what does that mean?
Thanks.
"Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money."
It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
"I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!"
"No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash."
...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
Fifteen bucks?!
"Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of!"
Yeah! Here's one.
"Yeah dude, you can test them."
This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo.
A six-layer burrito?
"Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?"
"But, how do they get away with that?"
What are you talking about?
Grandpa?
Grandpa.
"She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa."
"She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen."
"Yes, Grandpa."
"Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this!"
"Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?"
"I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?"
I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
No i wouldn't.
"No, because I really want you to kill yourself."
"I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!"
"Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself."
I'm not joking.  Do it.
Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
"Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: ""Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"""
"YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!"
You're not?
You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?!
"Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace!"
"Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work."
"So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it."
"Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something."
Yeah.
"Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore."
"Tango, Tango, I'm in position."
It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.
"Go, go, go."
"Oh, that's a good idea."
"Dude, we are on the front page!"
"Can we get a different pose, please?"
"It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late."
Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passÃ©.
"""Faith Hilling is pretty stale,"" said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. ""If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."""
That's all it is?
"Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe."
"Well, I'm glad we took care of that."
That's a cool idea
What seems pointless?
"No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap."
Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
"Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long-"
"Oh, hey, guys. How's it going?"
"Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out."
"Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back."
"You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants."
"Okay, that's good, a little higher."
"OK, whenever you're ready."
"Alright, go Cartman."
"Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome."
Fox trot standing by at position alpha.
Standing by in three seconds.
"Come on, dude. Hurry."
Wow!
"Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?"
That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
I'll do it! I'll be in charge.
"No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped."
"Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!"
"Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it."
"Butters, you're the star of the video!"
"Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?"
"Kyle? Dude, where are you going?!"
To stop bullying.
YES.
"...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-"
"Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!"
What the hell does that mean?
"Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!"
"Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!"
"I know, right?!"
"Oh, hey."
Huh?
"But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-"
No.
"What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?"
"Butters is totally fine with it, dude."
"Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!"
Oh yeah.
"This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!"
"...What, what was the question again?"
"...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!"
Why does he keep saying that?
"Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it."
I didn't know.
I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
"Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?"
Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.
"I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do."
Kyle!
"Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle!"
No!
Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!
"We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous."
"Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?"
I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
Yeah.
"And we were like, ""Other? We have to do this with other people?"""
Good. How are you?
"It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell."
"""Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"""
...Shuttle?
Uh that's okay.
Thank God.
I think we're good.
"So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining!"
"Oh, really??"
And it was like WHAM.
There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
"Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!"
"Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?"
"So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible."
"Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?"
"Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick."
...Yyyeah.
"Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go."
"Yea, please!"
You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
"Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!"
"No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!"
"I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought ""I can find us a way out!"" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it."
"You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!"
"We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!"
Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?!
The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
...Kenny? Kenny!
"And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said ""Stop it!"""
Stop it! It was me! My idea.
"Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together."
"If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano."
I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
"The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere."
Thank you.  Mr. Hankey.
What?
"Dude, why are you so into their relationship?"
"Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago."
"You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports."
"The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore."
"Dad, do we really have to wear bras?"
This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
"Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us."
I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
"The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory."
Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
"Cartman, you idiot!"
Dad?
What?
"Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!"
"Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!"
"We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says ""Competitiveness can be compassionate,"" he's being completely sincere?"
Yeah Dad. You need some of this.
"You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?"
Whoa duude!
"They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front."
"Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?"
"Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing."
"I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?"
"Dude! Dude, not cool!"
Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
Yeah dude. It's really serious.
"Dude, you okay?"
"Dude, what happened?"
What's this?
Whoa!
"But are you sure they had sex, like, ""sex"" sex, or they actually had sex?"
Well are you gonna tell your dad?
"Cartman dude, not now."
"You're gonna have to tell him, dude."
What?
You're talking about Butters.
Butters?
"Butters, come out here."
Hawaii?
"After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead."
"""On the morrow""? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?"
We're rich?
Blockbuster Video?
"Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad."
It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
I think something might be wrong with Dad?
"Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom."
"Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!"
"Dad, nobody's gonna come."
Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
"I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!"
"I know, but there's nothing I can do."
I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
"No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him."
"Oh never mind, I hate him again."
Yeah.
"How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home."
"Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house."
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
What? What's he doing?
"Hey, where did you guys go?"
"All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!"
Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
"No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt"
No no! We weren't gonna go there!
"NO!  I won't say anything, I promise!"
What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!
What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
"Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?"
"Oh, ah thank God you found me."
You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe!
They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
"Guys, you're okay!"
"It's all right, just a scratch."
"No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash."
"Yeah, people are gonna get hurt."
"Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover."
Oops.
"Hey, be careful in there."
"It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps."
Wait a minute. There they are!
"Listen everybody, those guys right over there are-"
"It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?!"
Hey dude.
"It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me."
"Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?"
Stay gold.
"It's all right, Dad."
"All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop."
Yeah I know.
"Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal."
"I don't know,  I just like it."
"Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off."
...I don't know.  I like it.
"No, I just, I don' know. No."
I have?
You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
"You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?"
...Farmers in where?
"Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?"
"Wow, this is happening so fast."
"My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing."
No thanks. I'll stand.
I'm good.
"Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, ""You never took the bracelet off? Not once?""  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground."
For what?
No! This is stupid!
No! I never cut if off!
"What's the big idea, Craig?!"
You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
"You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!"
"And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!"
"Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!"
Yeah.
Thanks Kyle.
Why does it matter?!
"You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!"
"Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!"
"You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!"
Jesus!
What are you doing here?
"Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?"
"Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that."
It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
"Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair."
"Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?"
"NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue."
"Pff it's like, that's here  and..."
"Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!"
Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
How can we raise awareness?
"Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets..."
Our... scause?
"Dude, the hell just happen?"
People are saying that?
"Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence."
We did it.
Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?!
"It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along."
We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
What would Jesus do?  Yeheah!
"Wow, really? That's pretty impressive."
But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
Is that an M&M?
Pry his mouth open!
"Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!"
What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week?
Huh?
"Oh, Red Lobster."
"Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?"
"There's nothing here, Kyle."
He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
"Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship!"
"Aw shit, it's him again."
"Well, we tried, dude."
"Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?"
"Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?"
"Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?"
Wow.
You guys are watchin' murder porn?
Okaaay.Â 
What's up dude?
"Yhh, yeah, the first grader?"
...What?!
What happened?
What?
You guys don't need to be watching that stuff.Â 
That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
What?
"Butters, what happened?"
"Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?"
In Minecraft.
Whattaya mean?
"It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see.Â "
"Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!"
"What, dude?"
So?
Aha!Â 
"You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!"
"No no,Â  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn."
"Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?"
We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
"No, that's way too long!"
"Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!Â Â Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?"
What?
I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
I... said it would really bum them out.
"Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad."
Is he doing it again?
"Cartman, are you feeling alright?"
That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
What the fuck?
Hey Kyle.
"Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too."
"...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?"
You like... how they smell? How they taste?
They're really that good?
Should I try them?
"...Kyle, maybe you should get some help."
"I don't get it, Kenny."
"Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head."
"Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world."
Hey Kyle.
"Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop."
"If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it."
All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
See? You sound like a dick.
"Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick."
I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
"This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!"
"Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?"
"No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!"
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
"Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!"
"You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all ""Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"""
You should apologize to Kenny too.
The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
ItÂ isÂ real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
The House of Greyhawk?
I like the PS4's controller better.
"The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...Â Â because that's how XBox people are."
"If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside."
"We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?"
Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
"No, you can't do that!"
"Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS."
Exactly!
"...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!"
And who do we have on our side?
Did you ask the Vamp kids?
There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side.Â 
So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
"When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!Â Â I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.Â Â Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4!Â All hail the Princess!Â "
Let them pass!Â Â 
The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
"The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it."
The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
WhatÂ IÂ started? How dare you!
"I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!"
The gods will find us a way!
"Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.Â Â Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here.Â "
The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
I have no idea.
Yes?
What?Â 
"So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own.Â "
And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
"Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan.Â "
"Yeah, sure, what about it?"
Why?
"Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s."
Who is that?
Did Kyle know about this?
Did Kyle know about this?!
Huh? Hello? Who is that?Â 
Get out of here!
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
"I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!"
...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
Get out of here! I'm done with you!Â Â Mom! Mom!Â Â Get him out of here!Â Â Get him out!Â 
We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.Â Â Because theyÂ wantÂ a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?Â Â Then you fucking fight!"
Yay.
"Yes, it is."
"Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?"
"Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.Â Â She got really hot all of a sudden."
"Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel."
She looks pretty hot here.
"Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?"
"A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are."
"Wendy, why is it such a big deal?"
I do?Â 
I don't get it. The whole fun ofÂ Call of DutyÂ is that you get to do the shooting.
I don't get it. The whole fun ofÂ Call of DutyÂ is that you get to do the shooting.
I don't get it. The whole fun ofÂ Call of DutyÂ is that you get to do the shooting.
What are you talking about?
"Hey, what's up?"
"Oh no, what now?"
Yeah?
"Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!"
Grandpa?
"Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!"
We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
"Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?"
Tell me about it.
Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
Nah.
Uh huh.
Angry Clit Spasm
Whooping Fart Balls.
Lubricated Titty Burgers.
Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge!
"Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name."
"No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company."
"No, we don't wanna do anything."
"...Nnnno, there isn't."
What?
"I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman."
Washington Redskins.  I like it!
You alright dude?
What?!
"I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either."
Yeah...
"I just... never saw myself owning a company called ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."""
"Why don't we just call it ""Untitled Startup Company""?"
"Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title."
"I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it."
"Good luck with your company, dude."
"It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other."
"And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,"
"Boy, this is the life, huh guys?"
But you all thought our name was sweet.
Morning!
Hey Wendy.
"Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out."
"So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie."
"Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing."
Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says?
For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
"Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something."
"What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down."
"Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him."
Sweet!
Excuse me?
"Wait, wait, ah I might need those."
We can't let our party suck.
I'll be back.
Dad? Dad!
"Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?"
"Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?"
"Nonono, not yet. DAD!"
"Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!"
Let me talk to my dad!
"There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have."
"I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-"
"Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now..."
"We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!"
"Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?"
"Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me."
What does that mean?
What is that?
Cartman's a girl now?
What?
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
"Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?"
...What?
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
"The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?"
"Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl."
"Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good."
...I don't know where I belong...
"I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused."
To the bathroom?
"Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah"
"Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?"
I know.Â 
Sup?Â 
What?
LetÂ meÂ see.
How'd you get that on your phone?
I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.
You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
"I'll pay you back for it, okay?!"
"I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!"
Ohhh hey guys.
"Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best."
"Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?"
"Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto.Â "
"You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?"
"It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out."
It's just...
"Yeah, it's fun."
"Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it."
...Free?Â 
"I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up."
One?
"No, no, it's not."
I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
"Okay, I need help.Â Â There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand."
It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
How?
"I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way?Â "
"Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them."
Okay.
So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
"Yeah, no, this is great."
"I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?"
That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications.Â 
"Ah, Canada?"
...Okay.Â Â Aaaaahhh!
I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me.Â 
Hey.
"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay.Â "
"I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie."
"We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps."
"That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking."
"Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies.Â "
"Butters, what the hell are you doing?"
Sound pretty typical to me.
Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
"Kyle, maybe this is for real."
"In on what?Â Â Ohh,Â Â Fuck you!"
"""Fuck you"" what?"
Oh fuck you!
"No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help!Â "
"It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real."
"No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time."
How do you know?
What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
Butters called Customer Service first?
"Come on, we're going to Butters' house!Â "
Butters.
So now weÂ areÂ in th real world.
"Yes, we're here."
Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
What?!Â 
That doesn't make sense!Â 
"Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!Â Â You guys? Are you there?"
Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point.Â 
"Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?"
"Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room."
"It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck."
"Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball."
Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
Shhh!
What's that?
This late?
It was seriously almost hard to watch.
"Wendy, did you hear about last night?"
Not that. Did you actually go to that?
Pfft whatever.
We're men.
"Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?"
That was freakin' hardcore.
It was just decimation.
Hell yeah!
What's mean about it?
"Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard."
"Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster."
"Dad, it's not that big a deal."
"Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic."
Do you think they're happy?
"Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play ""Magic: The Gathering""?"
"Hey, how about this little guy?"
Yeah!
"Gee, thanks!"
"Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit."
"Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill."
What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?!
"Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys."
A way to finally do something good for other people.
Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
Who did?
"That's a little strange, isn't it?"
That self-promoting asshole!
Because my dad's an idiot!
"Nnnothing, nothing."
"We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!"
"Yeah, you damn kids!"
"Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!"
"Because Lorde is my dad, alright?!Â Â Lorde is my dad."
He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
It just all seemed so... stupid.
"Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again."
What??Â 
Dude. You're such a grandpa.
"I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about."
Yeah.
"Yeah, I think that's great too."
What's a dildo?
"What's a dildo, Kenny?"
"Dude, that kicks ass!"
"Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night."
Dude! Visitors!
"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!"
Visitors are real.
"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?"
They took him on their ship.
"Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!"
"Good morning, Miss Crabtree."
"Oh, don't worry about him."
"Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch."
I said I have a bad itch.
Visitors!
"Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?"
"Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us."
"Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce."
"Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him."
Dude!
"Damn, Cartman!"
It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
How can you eat when you're farting fire?
Where?
"Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!"
I do not!
Bleech!
Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school.
What? How do you know she has a cat?
"Uh, Chef."
Chef.
Chef!
Chef!!
Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
Whoa!
"Killer! Thanks, Chef."
"Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now."
What the hell was that?
"Kyle, look! It's them."
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
"Hey look,  I think Kenny's okay."
Owww.
"Wow, poor Kenny."
"Dude, Kenny is dead!  See?"
"Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger."
"Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot."
But her note said she'd be here.
Bleech!
Bleech!
Bleech!
"Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love?"
"Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again."
I think we have to signal them somehow.
"Come on Cartman, fart!"
He can't hold it in forever.
"Hey, it's happening again."
"Now, do you believe this, Cartman?"
"Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!"
"Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back."
Yeah.
"That was beautiful, dude."
"No, they're leaving."
"Whoa, dude!"
"Hey Wendy, what's a dildo?"
"Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with."
"Thanks for your help, Wendy."
"Hey, I didn't throw up."
Bleech!
Sorry.
Cool.
I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof.
"That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago."
I don't know what the hell that is...
"Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around."
I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
"Oh, hey Cartman."
"Really, what about?"
"That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened."
"Yeah, it was huge."
"Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?"
"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?"
What were you talking about?
"That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart."
"Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet."
"Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest."
"Yeah, that'd be cool."
"We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy."
"Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly."
Dolphins are way smarter than you!
"Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos!"
Tell me what you wrote about!
"Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!"
What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
What's that stuff?
Superfatass?
Take that you stupid Indian!
Shut up Cartman!
"Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?"
"Wendy, look!"
"Mr. Garrison, stop!"
"Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?"
"Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?"
"Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches."
We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
"Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?"
"Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman."
"Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer."
"You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman."
"Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says."
"My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa."
"Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there."
"Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo."
Is this hunting?
I can't.
I don't want to shoot the bunny.
"I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny."
"I can shoot you, fat ass!"
I'll kill you!
"Yeah, Cartman's pee."
"Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too."
Whatabutt?
Why?
A hook.
Celery?
"Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories."
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
"What, dude?"
Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
"With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?"
What?
"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!"
Yeah.
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
"Ah, damn it, I can't do it!"
Cartman?
"Whoa, he built a wicker basket"
"I did it, I did it, I finally killed something."
"Hey, that was easy!"
What?! Why?!
No.
"But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny."
"Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons."
"Hiya, Sparky."
That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
"Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?"
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
He's not meaner than Sparky.
Sparky'll kick his ass.
"That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!"
"Sparky, bad dog!"
What?!
What do you mean?
He's just confused.
"Sick, shut up dude."
Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut--hut. hut. hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
Huh?
"Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart."
"Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!"
Get down Sparky! Down!
"Um, I'm not really prepared either."
"Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-"
"Wow, cool!"
"Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?"
What's a - homosexual?
I guess.
"Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?"
"He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay."
I don't know.
"Come on you guys, I have an idea."
"Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi."
"Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?"
"I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil."
Like who?
"Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual."
Damn it!
I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
"No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!  I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!"
"I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay."
I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
"Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back."
I think he might've run away.
I'm not playing.
I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog.
Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
Sparky! Sparky!
"Fine, how are you?"
"My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here."
D'you have lots of gay dogs here?
"Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy."
"Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?"
"I missed you old pal, you really had me scared."
"Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?"
What don't I understand?
"This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand."
Thanks for everything Big Gay Al!
"No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!"
"I will Big Gay Al, I will."
I've been getting my best friend back.
Hike!
Mph.
"Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys."
And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!
And it's okay to be gay!
"Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing."
"I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you."
"But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club."
"Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?"
Wow!
"Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere."
No!
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.
"My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!"
"Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?"
Yeah.
Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?
"Wow, that's cool!"
"Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants."
That'd be cool!
"Wait, wait.  We still need a pig."
Okay.
Yesâ¦
"Oh, neither.  It's my sister."
Hi Shelly.
Headgear?  What headgear?
"Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice."
"No, I think it looks terrific.  It matches your AAAAAH!"
Go where?
"Yeah, quit being such a baby."
At least I'm not a little pigfucker!
Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
Ow!
"Yeah! Go away, Pip!"
I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
So how do we do that?
"Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?"
Shut up Cartman!
"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!"
"Sick dude, she's my sister."
Crap.
"No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neckbrace?  Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know thatâ¦that you're my sister, and I love you.  No.  Ahh!  Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me."
"Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig."
Sick!
"Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?"
"Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig."
A big mutant version of me?
I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.
Oh my God!
"Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him."
"It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone."
Stop!
"That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down."
"Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?"
"â¦So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad."
"No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman."
"Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me."
You can't just leave me here alone.
Thanks a lot.
It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!
"Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh."
"Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!"
"It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on."
"Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?"
"Aw, dammit!"
Heheheh hehehe...
"My name's not Billy grampa, it's Stan."
Sure.
I'm not gonna kill you grampa.
"'Cause, I'll get in trouble."
Leave me alone grampa.
I'm not going to kill you grampa!
Good night grampa.
"Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!"
Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
"My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should."
Really??
Wow!
"So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?"
"Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late."
Yeah...
Hey Chef.
Bad.
"Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?"
"No, I mean, kill my grampa."
"See, I told you dude."
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
"Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay."
"No grampa, I'll get in trouble."
"No, I can't even kill a deer."
Grampa!
"Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you."
We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
"Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes."
"I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die."
"Hey, yeah!"
Jesus?
"Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?"
Yes?
Goddammit!
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
"Kyle, don't be such a butthole!"
"Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV."
"We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it."
Aaah!!
"We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and..."
"Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around."
"Aww, do I have to?"
"Hey, what are you doing?!"
"Uh, I guess.  Okay, you, you can let me out now."
"Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time."
"Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand."
"Sure I will grampa, I will."
"Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?"
"'Kay, come on guys."
"You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted."
Are you ready grampa?
"Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you."
What is that?!
"Hey, he's coming towards us."
"Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!"
"Yeah, but, mom!"
"Dad, Death is coming!"
"Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place."
Totally dude.
"Quick, jump through the window."
Hey look!
"Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time."
Whoa!
"Come on you guys, let's go home."
What do you mean?
"I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes."
Cool!
What are you doing grampa?
That's my silly grampa.
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
"Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready."
Shut up Kyle!
I'm Raggedy Andy.
"Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure."
Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
Where'd you get that?
"No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fatass!"
"I'll kick your ass, Kyle!"
"Hey look, Kenny's not dead."
"Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?"
"Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank."
"I said, ""I can't wait to own a fishing tank."""
"Whoa, dude!"
Wendy?
"You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?"
We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
You what?!
"He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything."
"Oh man, I feel like a total choad."
"Hey, where's Kyle?"
"Whoa, dude!"
"Yeah, me too."
"Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!"
I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
I bet I get more candy than you dude.
"No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference."
"Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!"
"Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight..."
Plastic pumpkin pails...
Taser...
"For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something."
How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!
"I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day."
"Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!"
"No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!"
"Dude, Kenny!"
"Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops."
"Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!"
What are you talking about Chef?
"Oh my God, that means..."
"Wait, where are we going?"
I don't know about this Chef.
What are we doing here Chef?
What?
We told you dude.
Hey Chef. Look.
"Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef?"
Let's get out of here!
We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
You call the number Kyle.
We'll hold 'em off.
Sweet!
Wendy?
"I know, but uh-... but..."
"Hey, yeah!"
"Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it."
"I, I can't."
Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
"That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead."
"Oh man, I can't believe he's gone."
"Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw."
"You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving."
"Oh, then, what's Halloween about?"
Oh.
Yeah.
"Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month."
That was awesome!
"Hey, who's that fat chick?"
Oh.
Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
SWEET!
I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.
Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?  Oh.
"Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear."
Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Just a second fat-ass!
"Hello? No, no, it's a ma- Vas-deferens?"
Oh.
Do we get the sports watch right away?  She says we do.
"You mean, like Kenny?"
Damn.
"Dude, that's not a digital sports watch."
"Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch."
"Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?"
I think he said his name is Marvin.
"Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow."
It was my mom's credit card.
This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
"Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share."
"Yeah, yeah, we do!"
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.
He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
No.
So why can't he live here now?
"This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend."
"Hey, where's Cartman?"
"Dude, the mutant turkeys are back!"
"Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!"
We did it!!
"Wow, it sucks he has to leave."
"You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I."
"Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus"
"Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?"
Christmas Poo?
"Whoa, Christmas snow!"
"That was sick, dude!"
"...nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude."
Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
"We'll catch up with you later, Kyle."
"Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?"
"See you around, dude."
The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.
Yeah.
You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
What's that?
"What's in the box, dude?"
"Dude, sick!!!"
"Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep."
"Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please."
I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.
"This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen."
We committed him.
Huh?!  O-oh.
"This is horrible!  Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!"
I believe.
"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
"You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too."
Wh-what could it be?
"Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?"
"Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too."
"Whoa, dude!"
"Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?"
Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want.
"Oh great, Green Mega Man it is."
"Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?"
"Hey new kid!  Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog."
What the...&#160;?
A what?
"Hey, Chef."
Whoa!
"Jesus, Jesus!"
"Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil."
"This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you."
Yeah.
Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
You're gonna fight Satan?
"I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?"
"Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in."
Did the Devil show up yet?
"Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge."
"Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'"
"Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart."
"Bubye, Fartboy."
"Hey, Jesus."
"Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God."
"Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs."
"But you're his sparring partner, Chef."
"Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili."
"Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid."
"Whoa, that was cool!"
"Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!"
"Aaanh, he does this all the time."
"Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus."
"Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!"
Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
What?
... Really?
"Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'"
"You did, Jesus."
"Nah, I saw it on Star Trek."
Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny."
You're leaving already?
Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
I know.
"I can't afford a cruise, dude."
"Shut up, Cartman!"
You can say that again.
Yeu-bluuuch.
"I'll kick your ass, Cartman!"
Bluuuch
You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
"Yeah, that one!"
No.
"Sure, Wendy, whatever."
Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!
Bluuch! I'd love to.
That's not Kyle's...
"We've got to learn how to do that, dude!"
"Ploozer gift, ploozer gift."
Bluuch.
See? She liked my present the best!
No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
I bet I scored 100!
"Oh, hi, Wendy."
That's impossible!
What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
A whatbian?
"Kenny?  No, explain it to us, Chef."
Oh.
"Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!"
"You're just saying that, Cartman."
"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?"
Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect.
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
"No, you're a fatter lesbian than me."
"Wow. Hi, Wendy."
Wow!
"Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back."
Bluuch. Kick ass!
Are we making love now?
They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
"You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says."
But why?
"It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?"
I think so.
Yup.
Yup.
Did I what?
"Oh my God, she killed Kenny!"
Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
"Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff."
Bluuuuch!
Sorry.
Isn't that your job?
Oooh.
"Dude. Shut up, Cartman."
What is it?
Whoa!
"What are you going to do with it, dude?"
"You did throw it away, Cartman."
"Well, you might as well let it go."
I have a button we can use for his nose.
"Ow, that sucks, dude!"
...so?
Like John Elway important?
D'you know John Elway?
"Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!"
"Why do you wanta know, lady?!"
"Whoa, dude!"
It's Saturday.
"Man, the bus sure is late."
Fine.
"Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it."
"Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on."
"Yeah, let us go!"
"Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude."
"Whoa, dude!"
"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
Get us down from here!
Robert Smith? Sweet!
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
"My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?"
Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!
"Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch."
"Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!"
He did it!
Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
"Good-bye, Robert Smith!"
"Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?"
"Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me."
"Go to hell, Cartman!"
Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
Yeah.
Oh my God! Look!
"Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school."
Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.
"We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!"
"I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch."
I always wondered if that would work.
In the backyard?
"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
"No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help."
Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
No.
Is that legal?
"Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made."
"I donnow, just keep rolling."
"Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!"
Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
Aaawww.
This guy sucks!
Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
What??
"What are you talking about, Cartman?!"
"Go ahead, dude."
"Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!"
"Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it."
Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
Cartman?!
"Dude, I thought you said you were Native American."
"Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000."
"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny."
Huh?  Oh yeah.
How 'bout some ice cream?
"Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!"
Man! Cartman's gonna be famous!
"Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever."
"How's it going, Cartman?"
"Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?"
"Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude."
"Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize."
"Uh, yyeah."
"Uuh, you'll see."
"We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money!"
"Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!"
Dude. We lost.
Grampa!!
"Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!"
"Oooh- hey, Kenny."
Could you pull over so I can get out?
I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
"Ugh. I can't do it, dude."
Oh man.  I'm gonna be sick.
Oogh.
Ooooogh.
Aghh!
I'm gotta get outta here!
"Okay okay, let's get outta here now!"
"Oh, weak."
"Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?"
"No way, dude!"
No.
Oh boy.  Bleech!
"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
"He was a good friend, and I'll miss him."
"Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?"
"Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!"
Hey you guys. Check out these books.  Sabrina Unchained.
"If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?"
I don't know. Let's go see.
"Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?"
"Hey, what's this?"
"Yeah, I wonder what's wrong."
"I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind."
"I can't see, dude!"
"No, we just fake it to shut him up."
"Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much."
"Oh, my God! They've killed--"
"Oh, never mind."
"It's cool, dude. We'll help you."
"""If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft""."
I.
"A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond."
"Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind."
What's it say? What's it say?
I dunno.
"Come on, dude, it's not that hard!"
Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
Look!
"Oh my God, they've killed--"
Goddammit!
"Aw, I think that's a mask, dude."
"What are you talking about, dude?!"
"That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude."
Cartman!
Hey! So what are you going to do now?
"They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days."
"I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back."
Booooo!
"I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
Why do dogs have cold noses?
Oh.
"Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?"
"Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?"
"Well, dude, you better find out!"
"Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
"Man! That sucked, getting searched."
"No, dude, we never even saw it!"
"We know, we know, that's what everybody says."
What do ya mean?
"Ahhh, bicycles?"
Your eyes?
"Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good."
Kyle! You have to stop them!
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
They're gonna chop off his wee wee!
"Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!"
"Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris."
"What are you goin' to do, dude?"
"Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike."
"Dude, what did you make that doll out of?"
"Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you."
"Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!"
"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
"Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude."
"Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!"
"Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad."
Yeah.
Naturally.
"You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine."
"Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?"
Yeah.
"Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball."
"If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins."
"Dammit, we lost one already!"
"Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup!"
We're losing men fast out here!
"No, Cartman. Nobody ever has."
Wa-was it wearing clothes?
"Oh, yeah. Eeww."
AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
No! I have to get it out!
ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?"
"Aw, do we have to?"
Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
"Whoa, dude, this is a school?"
"Okay, what have you got?"
Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!  Places!
"Chef, we're hungry."
"But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!"
"Dude, Chef has lost it."
"Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese?"
Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
You don't?
"Damn, dude. China's fucked up."
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
"Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?"
"Dude, it's the freak nurse!"
"Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter."
"Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam."
No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
Whoa!
Wow!
"""...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam."" The end."
From Vietnam veterans.
"No, no, we didn't--"
"Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--"
"For what, dude?"
Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
How?
"Well, what do you mean?"
"Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses."
Yeah.
"Ready, you guys?"
Okay. Action!
Cut! Cartman!
It's supposed to be a frog!
"Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?"
"Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?"
Action!
"Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you."
"Okay, when I yell ""action"", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared."
"It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?"
Good. A-and action!
"They deserve it for lying to us, dude."
They're here! Hurry and hide!
"Holy crap, dude."
"Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!"
"Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!"
We shot all those videos and sent them in.
"Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'."
It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
"Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!"
"Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me."
You big piece of crap!
"Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!"
"W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble."
Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
"Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!"
"No, your producer did.  She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs."
"During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!"
"W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world."
"Hey, Cartman!"
Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
"Give us some, Cartman!"
"Dude, the road is always snowy."
"Shut up, Cartman!"
"Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would."
"Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now."
Where are we?
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
"Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on."
Dude!
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
"Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary."
I think we have to signal them somehow.
"Come on Cartman, fart!"
He can't hold it in forever.
"Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?"
"Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass."
Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay.
"Now, that was what I call a sticky situation."
Do you see 'er dude?
"No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!"
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
"Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus."
What time is it?
"Dude, I think it's Saturday now."
"Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us."
"I don't know, it's- a big scary monster."
What?
"Hey, look!"
"Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice."
"Mr. Garrison, stop!"
"But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun."
What was that?
"Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!"
Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
"Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you."
"Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!"
"Hoh boy, we're in big trouble."
Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
What?
"We believe in you, Fonz."
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
"You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!"
Oh no!
"Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much!"
"I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude."
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
Hey yeah!
"Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?"
"Boy, do I!"
"Cartman, no!"
The bus is going over!
Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
"GAAA-uh.  Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare."
"Dude, I just had the weirdest dream."
"Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles."
"Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems."
Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later.
"Shut up, Pip."
"Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks."
"I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt."
"Jesus, Cartman!"
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
"So, we'll have ten M-80s, please."
Heard what?
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
"Oh gosh, killed Kenny!"
"A summer without fireworks is likeâ¦ I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass."
"Man, it's hot out here."
I know! Let's go sledding!
"Come on, Cartman, get on."
"What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?"
What the hell is going on?
"Hi, Uncle Jimbo."
"Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year."
Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
"Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison."
That's good.
Right.
"Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard."
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
"Whatever, dude."
"But Cartman, we're trying to--"
"What does he mean, ""living in denial""?"
"There, how does that look?"
"Uh, crap..!"
He's taking swimming lessons.
"How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?"
"Yeah, they need to shut it off."
"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"
"Man, this sucks."
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
"Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves."
How many days left in summer?
Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
"Hi, Uncle Jimbo."
There's nothin' to do.
"Hey, look! We blew up the snake!"
Winter's back!
"Well, I can hardly wait."
"Hey, Chef!"
"Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too."
"Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer."
She's not my girlfriend.
"Damn, dude. Look at all these people."
Whatcha doin'?
"Calm down, tubby."
"Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway."
When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
They what?!
"Oh, brother."
Dude!
Dude!
"Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!"
"Yeah, pretty much."
"The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen."
"Dude, now that'd be like IMAX."
Are they good?
"Hey, dude, these are good!"
There is what again?
"Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?"
"To the sewer, dude."
What was that?
Mr. Garrison?
What do you mean?
"Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?"
"Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie."
"Jeez, they made that into a movie already?"
"Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!"
"If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!"
So what do we do now?
Why?
"Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you."
Okay!
Sorry.
"Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach!"
"No problem, dude."
What the hell is he doing?
"Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you."
"Dude, you've got herpes on your face!"
Ow!
"Yeah, it's pretty weird."
We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
Catch what?
Sshh! Cartman!
"Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!"
Huh?
"Dude, I think I just saw a rat!"
I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
Oh.
"Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?!"
"Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night."
"Well, you sure seem happy about it!"
Okay.
Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
"Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha."
"No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- Ey! Get me out of here!"
Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
"Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo."
Wait! Where are you going?
Milkshakes?!
Weak!
And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
They did?
Why?
Of course!
"Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!"
It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
How does someone get herpes?
But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser.
"And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do."
"Thanks a lot, Frida!"
I don't wanna go back there.
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
"You know, freshen up your breath."
Pretty good.
"Wow, coo-hul!"
We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
"I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff."
It's boring.
"Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?"
This is stupid.
"Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium."
I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
"Yeah, mine too."
"Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!"
"Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!"
That's a haiku?
Oh.
No.
Yeah. What's a discharge?
"Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too."
"Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?"
"Where have you been, Cartman?"
Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
"Dude, what just happened?"
"Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens."
"Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-"
"Dude, this isn't right."
"We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything."
"Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there."
"Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see."
He hits this switch-
"Yeah, I guess so."
I don't know.
"This says ""maximum.""  Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!"
"Dude, I told you something was up with this place!"
"...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis."
"Yeah, pretty sure."
What other crime in South Park?
"Oh, no! They got Chef, too!"
"Why are you doing this, dude?"
Mr. Mackey!
Get over here and untie us!
Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
"Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!"
"No, you don't!"
"Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself!"
Huh-I dunno.
"Hi, Wendy."
...No.
We could?
"But dude, I don't have a clubhouse."
Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
"Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do."
We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help.
"Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse."
How do we do it?
"Yeah, dude! How'd you know?"
Dude!
Sweet!
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
"Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play."
"Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?"
"Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs."
We're building a clubhouse.
"Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!"
Fine!
Fine!
Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
'Kay.
But Mr. Twig sucks.
"Better than yours, fat boy."
Almost.
"Yes, Mr. Garrison."
"Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings."
Phew.
"No, I just--"
I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
But I didn't write the note!
"Shut up, Cartman!"
"Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!"
What's 'skylarkings'?
Who?
"Oh, no."
"It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's."
Excuse me.
Hello?
I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
"I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow!"
My mom won't let us.
Pretty good. We're almost done.
We're going as fast as we can!
"Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster."
No.
I didn't even think about that.
"And I say, ""Dare!"""
"""Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her."
Oooh.
Yeah.
"""Dare!"""
Oooh.
You really think so?
Wow!
Hello?
We're working on it.
"No, you don't!  Dude!"
"Aw, that hunk of fat--  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?"
What?! Why?
"Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?"
"...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!"
What?!
This is happening way too fast.
Okay. We're done.
"It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls."
' G'oh?
Go where?
But no! I have to get the girls to come-
Weak!  Dad?
But I don't understand why we have to--
"Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?"
"But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister."
What? That's it?
"I guess, but--"
"Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute."
"No way, dude! Don't be silly."
"We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right?"
"Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager."
"To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez."
"Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?"
"Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever."
"Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times."
Dude!
"Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes."
"Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?"
Dare.
"...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!"
Crap!
Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
What?
My dad lets me watch cartoons.
Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
"If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!"
Oh.
Divorce is stupid.
"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy."
Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
Dare.
...What?!
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
Really?
What's that?
What the hell was that?
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
"Yeah, this line is way too long!"
Here we go.
What ride?
My ass we will!
"Yeah, let's not ride that ride again."
We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
"Sorry, Officer Buttbaby."
"Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?"
This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
He really wants those dolls.
"Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman."
We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.
How long was that?
"Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that."
What are you going to do?
"Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea."
"Hold on, Cartman!"
"Come on, Cartman."
"You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?"
What's the matter with him.
But can he still ride a bull?
"Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?"
What?!
"Oh, he's fine, dude."
"Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo."
How's he doing?
Do you think he can ride the bull?
Cool.
"Jesus, dude!"
"Oh, hell!"
"Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride."
"Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!"
There he is!
"Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!"
"Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this."
I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
"Dude, that bull's gonna kill him."
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
"We did it, dude, we did it!"
Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
"Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden?"
We should-
"Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!"
"Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh."
"Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?"
Oh-h. Nowhere.
But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
"What, dude?"
That's what Cochran used in the O. J. Simpson trial.
"Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail."
"Hello there, Chef."
"Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up."
You do?
"Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich."
"We've gotta help him, dude."
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
"Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass."
Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
"Wow, you remember him?"
So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
"Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?"
'Kay.
"Thanks, dude."
"Hello, are you Meat Loaf?"
"Our friend, Chef."
Wow! So you'll help him?
"Yeah, thanks.  Thatâs $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!"
Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
"No, you don't!"
You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
No more Chef.
"We can't let him down, you guys."
"Dude, it's over. He's gone."
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
"It's easy, dude. Chef Aid."
"Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets."
"Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!"
Elton John! What are you doing here?
"Boy, do we!"
"Yeah, dude, it's all yours."
"Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?"
"Weâre gonna raise your money, Chef."
"Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kennyâs head off!"
I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
"Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?"
What?
"Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve."
"Dude, this is creepy."
"Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo!"
Wow!
I don't know.
I don't like it. It's spooky.
Do I have to?
Damn it!
"Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor."
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
"Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice."
"Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?"
"Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!"
"Why do you keep saying ""hella,"" fatass?!"
"Can you leave the light on, Dad?"
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
Where did it go?  Huhhh.
Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom!
"Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!"
No!
AAAAAAAAH!
The fish!  But-.
WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
"Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-."
You're not gonna get away with this!
"Mom, what are you doing?"
"Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next!"
But MOM!
MMOOMM!
"No, mom!"
I haven't been sleeping so well.
"Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?"
"Do you think animals can be murderers, too?"
I haven't been sleeping well.
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
What are you doing?!
"Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people."
What?
"Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!"
"Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease."
Cartman!
"Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?"
Do you remember what pet store?
Where?
"That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store."
"Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!"
It was the fish!
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver.
"Come on, we're running out of time."
"Yeah, my goldfish-."
I know.
"Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!"
I wanna return a fish.
"Yeah, dude."
So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
"We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe."
"Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish."
"I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!"
"Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman!"
Yeah!
I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
"You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman."
"Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care."
"We won, dude!"
"Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us!"
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
Get to the stage!
"Up yours, evil twin!"
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya.
"Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!"
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
"You tricked us, Cartman!"
"But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!"
But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
I don't want your lame-ass supper!
Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway!
"Okay, let's go!"
"'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!"
"So, how far is it to Nebraska?"
"Yeah. Or, we could not."
This is Nebraska?
"Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?"
He's the fat one.
"Sick, dude."
"Yeah, right!"
My family's dead!
They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
"Dude, is he here every year like this?"
"Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here."
"What, dude?"
"Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans."
What was that?
I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming.
We thought you were in jail.
"Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall."
All families suck ass!
Do you really think we should go with this guy?
Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
I really like that guy.
Mr. Hankey?
You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
"Oh, boy. You've done it now."
"Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?"
Hey. Where's Kenny?
"Oh, hey Kenny."
There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
Oh ooh.
...Sorry.
"Dude, they're gonna kill me."
'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.
"Please, I don't wanna go back with them."
I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
What?!
"But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me."
"I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks."
"I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom."
Really?
"Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?"
"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
That's okay with us.
"Oh, not Tweek."
"Dude, we can't work with this kid."
No.
"Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--"
"Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about."
"Great. A lot of help you are, kid."
What?
What gnomes?
"Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes."
"Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it."
'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
"Wow, that sucks, dude."
Yeah.
Kind of bitter.
Aooooo!
"Yeess, this stuff rocks!"
Whoopee!
"Yeah, mine too. I wonder why."
"Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!"
Bad!
"No, we'll use it."
"Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!"
Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
Huh??
Our case?
Uh... Hooray.
Uh...
I like small businesses.
"Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!"
"'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!"
"Yeah, that makes sense."
How do we stretch that into five minutes?
What the hell?
"Hey there, little guy."
"Hey, he talks!"
"Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?"
"Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?"
"Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?"
"Damn, dude, this place is huge!"
I don't get it.
"No you don't, fatass!"
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny."
Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
Underpants?
"Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations."
"Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay!"
Holy crap. dude!
This guy rules!
Yeah!
Dude!
"Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!"
Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
"Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, you okay?"
"Can you climb back up, dude?"
"Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him."
"Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch."
"Sorry.  What the hell are you doing, fat boy?!"
All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this?
"He's like, some frozen guy."
"Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends."
"You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!"
Help me chip some of the ice away.
"Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?"
Where shall we bring it?
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve?
"You didn't find him, I found him."
You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
"Huh, excuse me?"
I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
Really.
Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
"Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak."
"No, it isn't!"
"I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!"
"No, I'll go! I found him!"
"Oh my God, they revived Gorak."
Uh. Hi.
"He said, ""hi."""
He wants to know where he is.
You're... home.
"Dude, you've been frozen 32 months."
"Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him."
"Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!"
Fine!
He doesn't look very happy in there.
"I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!"
You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
"Let him out, dude. He's scared."
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?
"I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out."
What are you doing here?
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
His name is Gorak!
Gorak!
What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
No he doesn't!!
"I found him, I'm rescuing him!"
You're a dick!
"You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!"
"Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!"
"Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3."
"I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait."
"Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!"
"You suck as a best friend, Cartman!"
"What are you doing, Gorak!"
"Wow, that sucks, dude."
"What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!"
"Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!"
"Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!"
Come on!
"We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please."
"My friend, Gorak!"
"No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!"
"Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock."
'K.
O-okay.
'K
Ow!
"Watch my coat, dude."
Huh?
"No problem, Gorak."
Yup.
Right on.
His... name... is... Gorak!
They're after you!
Where's Gorak??
"Wait, look! The helicopter!"
He's alive!
"Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy."
Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
Choirs suck.
It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
What?!
But we don't even care about the rainforest.
"Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!"
Nooo-ho!
"No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right."
Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm.
Aaah! Snake!
Oh.  Aaah! Snake!
Oh.
AAAAAAA!
SNAAAKE!
AAAAAAA!
I'm just a-scared of snakes.
Dude!
"Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!"
"I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme."
This doesn't look very safe.
Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
"Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke?"
Holy crap!
Jesus Christ!
We're sinking.
"All we ever heard growing up was, ""Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile""!"
"Oh, now she figures it out."
Wow!
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny."
They did.
"You know, ""they."""
Help ...him?
"Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?"
Why is that funny?
That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
He just... ignited.
"Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on."
"Wow, that was short."
The what?
"I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible."
"Dad, where's our Bible?"
Or else what?
...What?
Where's our Bible?
"Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?"
"...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection."
"Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets."
Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
"And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him."
Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross.
"Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks."""
"And then Jesus was lead away  to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrurection three days later."
This spot looks good.
"Okay, cool. See you, Cartman."
"Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess."
"Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection."
"Whoa, dude, my dad's famous."
"Wow, he died."
Cartman??
"Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus."
"(Sick, dude!)"
"(Okay, okay, just go away!)"
Uh. We've been taking care of him.
Apples?
(Dude!)
(I don't think I like this new law.)
Yeah.
"Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!"
"Dude, he's still not dead."
That's not your mom calling!
He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
"Hey, yeah!"
"Dad, where's the phone book?"
"Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?"
Oh.
"Uh, it... sucks ass."
"Oh my God, what's going on?"
"Dude, that's my dad!"
"I know, huh?"
He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
"What are you doing, dad?"
"No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!"
"Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!"
"Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross."
"See, at first, Jesus was all like, ""Why me?"" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."""
It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime.
Huh?
"Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?"
Dad. Dad!
"Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!"
See? My dad is the coolest after all.
Cartman!
"He's been up there for like, three weeks."
That's amazing!
"Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?"
"Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch."
"Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman?"
Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
Where's Chef?
Why did Chef quit?
Could you just hand us some food please?
"Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back."
"Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today."
But why? Why would you quit?
So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
Talked?!
"That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!"
What the hell is going on?!
She's stealing Chef from us.
"Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new?"
"...Yeah, screw that bitch."
Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
We wanna talk to Chef.
And a chef hat.
Huh?
"Chef, you have to dump the bitch!"
But we don't like her.
I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.
Dude! He bailed on us!
Come on! We're going to his house!
You forgot!
Oh no! No nononononono!
"Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time."
What's a succubus?
Yeah!
"Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!"
Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him.
Who are you?
"Chef, we have to talk to you!"
You're Chef's parents?
"No, that's okay."
He wanted money?
"Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?"
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!"
"Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman."
"Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us."
"We know what you are, lady!"
A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
I guess.
Jesus dude!
"Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news."
Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
"Chef, but-"
No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
"Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them."
Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
What the hell does that mean?
Right.
Yeah?
Oh-hoho!
That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
"We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman??"
God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.
There she is!
Bitch. Bitch.
Bitch.
All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
Here it goes.
"Now, Cartman!"
Come on Cartman!
Oh my God! She killed Kenny!
"We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!"
We'd love them!
"Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?"
Tweek is!
"Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls."
I don't know. He's such a wuss.
No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
How much?
You're on!
Hey Tweek.
Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
"Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?"
"He's really got it out for you, dude."
Super. See you there.
Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!
The bell rang. Can we go?
"Come on, you guys."
"This is gonna be so sweet, dude."
"You're on, fatass!"
"How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?"
"Aw, hell!"
Tweek?
"How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!"
"Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"""
"Yeah, it was weak."
Tomorrow?
"Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45."
"Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go."
Well?
Huh?
"Aw, dude, come on!!"
"All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight."
"All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig."
"Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!"
Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
Damn it!
"Okay, the time has finally come."
You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
Ye-hah!
"Come on, Tweek! You got him!"
Yeah.
Here they are.
Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching.
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
"Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig."
"Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?"
"Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you."
"So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies."
"Well, I mean, that's what was on the news."
"Come on, Tweek! You got him!"
Where are you going?
So? You can poo in the wilderness.
Not here! Go further away!
"Sick, dude!"
"We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!"
I see it!
I saw it this way!
"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!"
I think his name is Junjun.
Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?
Wow!
"No, he's annoying."
Why don't we just tell our parents?
Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here.
"Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!"
"Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?"
God-damn!
"Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?"
Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
"Dude, it's crowded in here."
"Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!"
"Oh, he'll win. Don't worry."
"Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that."
Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
"Ohh, dude, get me out of here!"
"You would think that, you little ass-sucker."
"An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker."
What?
"No you can't, you little ass-sucker!"
"Hoh, whatever!"
I called you an ass-sucker!
"What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!"
Wwhat do you mean?
Uh... I'm eight?
Huh?
I have to give him half my stuff?
"Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy."
"Uh, no! I hate that toy!"
Damnit!
Where's our desks?
"You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?"
Bad.
"Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?"
"Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!"
"'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please."
We want Sexual Harassment Panda.
"Well, where is he?!"
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
'Scuse me.
Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
...Coats?
"Dude, what the hell is going in?!"
"Well, we don't take kindly to you!"
"Come on, we'd better hurry."
"""Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune"". This must be the place."
Whoa! Who are you?
"...Thanks a lot, dude."
Have you seen any panda bears?
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
"Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!"
"Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other."
"Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again."
"No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say."
I don't want to go to this stupid party!
"No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels."
Awww!
I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
"No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!"
"Shut up, Pip."
"Butters, is there any way out of here?"
Oh my God.
No.
Yes.
"Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me."
"Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!"
What?
What do I have to do?
"Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast."
"What, Pip?"
What the hell do you want?!
You did?
We're going upstairs.
"Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs!"
"Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set."
"I don't care, just hurry!"
Rad!
There are no more missions. I have everything I want.
Just... play something else! God!
"Whoa, cool!"
Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
Dude!
Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them.
"Mom, go look outside."
"Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves."
We don't have any weapons.
Get back inside!
"Dad! Dad, they shot at us."
Mom!
"Get a hold of yourself, man!"
Come on. We have to find out what's happening.
Sh!
We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
"Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real."
Tell them not to burn us down.
Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
"You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job."
"Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?"
"We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there."
"Can you hit a target, Pip?"
Hit something nice and solid now.
"Nice job, Pip."
"Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn."
He made it down.
"But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along."
You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
Super weak.
"Hey, fat ass."
"Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe."
What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
"Yeah, like ancient history."
"No, dude!"
"Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective."
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
Ogh..!
"Yeah, get with the times, dude."
"Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?"
"Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!"
"How's it goin', fat ass?"
What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure.
Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
You didn't know that?
"Dude, did you just say ""a-ight""?"
"Yeah, dude. Nobody says ""a-ight"" anymore."
Can you see anything?
"It's starting, it's starting!"
Juuhachi desu ka?
"Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san."
"He said, ""Garrison-san sabuchii da naa."""
"Yeah, dude. That was totally gay."
Totally gay.
Kore wa watashi no uchi desu.
Nan da kore?
What?
You like it?
"No.  Screw this, dude."
"Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something."
"Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?"
"Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore."
"No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused."
...Ye-eah.
"Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes."
What the..?
What??
"* I told you, fatass."
Sshh!
We don't know.
Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV.
"Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news."
"Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing."
"Kick ass!  Wow, this thing is awesome!"
Wow!
This is great!
"Yeah, that's better."
"Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world."
"What the hell did you hit, Cartman?!"
"We're on like, some foreign planet."
"Uh, thanks."
"U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth."
Cool!
"Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!"
"Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here."
Uuh. Thanks.
"Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar."
What??
Oh.
Run for it!
"He's not done for, he's standing right there."
"Alright, we made it!"
They're shooting at us.
"Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself."
"You dumbass, Cartman!"
"You got 'em, Marvin."
Sally Struthers is saving us!
Now's our chance!
"We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us."
"Wow! Good job, dude!"
"Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again."
Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.
Dude!
"I know, but you don't tell him that!"
"This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt."
Christmas?
W-we weren't scared!
That's just an old legend.
I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
"Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary."
"Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts!"
"Come on, fatass, we have to go!"
"Yes you can, porky."
"Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders."
What's the scariest thing we could get?
No!  A dead body.
"We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real."
We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.
"Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?"
"All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,"
"Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to."
"Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!"
"Well, let's dig 'er up!"
Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
"You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!"
"Yes you do! Now, dig!"
"Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude."
"Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh."
"Okay, grab the sled."
"Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders."
Who was that?
"Dude, not cool. This is scary."
"Hay, you're that band KoRn."
What are you guys doing out here?
"Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders."
Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
"Yeah, dude. It's right over there."
"Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes."
"Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go!"
Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever.
"Where's your costume, fatass?"
"Hey, Kenny."
Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet
What's the problem?
She has to be here!
"We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away."
Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
How should we split up?
This place gives me the creeps.
We've got to hide!
Ow!
There she is!
"Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back!"
Boo!
"I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before."
"Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart."
We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
What's that?
"Shut up, Cartman?"
"You shut up,  gaywad!"
"No, we're friends."
What?
"Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos."
"Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground."
"You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass."
"Come on, Pip, say it. Say ""Please, hit me."""
"No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say ""Please, hit me,"" I won't hit you."
All right.
"Alright, we'll try this again, Pip."
"Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own."
"Aw, man, if you have to."
"Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now."
"Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff."
"Ah, dude, you don't say that."
Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
"Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?"
"Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!"
But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
"Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!"
Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
"Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!"
"Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help?"
"Oh, brother!"
"You suck now, Kyle!"
"Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!"
"Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark."
"Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark?"
"Nice speech, nerdo."
Ready? 1-2-3-4.
"That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!"
Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4.
"Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!"
"Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment."
He'd better!
"Dude, that's not cool."
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
"You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!"
Hoohoo what a dumbass!
It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
"Cartman, you can't do that!"
"Run for your life, dude!"
"Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!"
"Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas."
Oh here comes the bus.  Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
What battlefield?!
"God damnit, that fat piece of shit!"
That would suck so much ass.
"I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?"
"Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought."
"Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home."
"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"
I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
"There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home."
"Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave."
"Haha! You lose, fatass!"
Where are you going?
"Oh, no."
"Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here."
"No, you can't do that. Our dads are there."
"Aw, damnit!"
"Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves."
"Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?"
"Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy."
"Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering."
"It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!"
Don't touch me.
"Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-"
Awwww!
"Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!"
"What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing."
"Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again."
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.
I'll try
to make it spin.
It fell;
I'll try again.
I'll try
to make it spin.
It fell;
I'll try again.
I'll try
to make it spin.
It fell;
I'll try again.
I'll try
to make it spin.
It fell;
I'll try again.
I'll try
to make it spin.
It fell;
I'll try again.
I'll try
to make it spin.
It fell;
I'll try again.
AAAA!
"Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome."
No you didn't!
How do you know?
"You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?"
"Please, it's important."
"Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us."
Hello?
"No, there's no blood coming out of my ass."
"Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways."
"Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's."
So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
You did?
"Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan"
Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!
I'm not bleeding out my aahass!
"No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon."
"Hey, Chef."
Bad.
Can I come in?
"Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't."
No.
"Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't."
"Yeah, Cartman told us."
Okay.
"...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time."
"But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it!"
But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
"Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad."
"No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself."
So do you know anything that can help him?
Hormones?
"Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best!"
Hey assholes!
Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
"Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!"
So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones.
"Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs."
Have I missed anything?
"No. I didn't, but-"
"Jesus, why does God hate me?"
He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
"Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?"
What do you mean?
I just wanted my period.
I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?!
"Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before!  Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

Let's have a cup o-Aaaa!
What's Arkansasâis that a state?
"What's ""lose bowel control?"""
Who's Karen Carpenter?
Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting.
We're not rednecks!
Why?! Don't you know?!
Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
Damnit!
You did?
"Damnit Cartman, wha-?!"
Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading!
"Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means."
"No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em."
What word could we make up?
"No, uhno, not finkleroy."
"Yeah, mung."
Sh. Here they come.
You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
We busted you!
It is?
Ooogh.
"You dumbass, Cartman!"
I have no idea.
I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
You found what?
No way.
"Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
"How do we write he note, Cartman?"
"Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played.  Come on.  There.  That should do it."
"Okay, let's get back to the room."
"Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants."
"Oh no, dude. Look!  It's the music we changed!"
Stop! Stop!
"Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means."
"Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here."
Uuuuh...
You do?
We win again!
Sleds are for guys.
"Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else."
You got it!
Noo problem!
"Oh, boy! We'll show them!"
"Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice."
"Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?"
Hello?
Son of a bitch!
"Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday."
"Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?"
"Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid."
"Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go!"
"Nice going, fat boy!"
"Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!"
"Come on, let's get it a try."
Yeah-
"Dude, bail! Bail!"
"Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny."
We Killed Kenny. We're bastards.
Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
"You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted."
That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
"Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!"
"Yeah, you stupid umbassday!"
...Yeah.
Sshh!
How are we supposed to give them to you?
But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
"Alright, here."
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file.
"There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!"
"Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity."
Yeah.
Hi. Can Token come out and play?
"Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?"
It's not?
"Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?"
"Okay, go ahead and start."
"Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy.""  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws."
"If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?"
"Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same."
That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
"Alright, where's Clyde."
"Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!"
It's Cartman!
All right! Let's do this!
Come on! We've gotta catch up to them!
We're not gonna make it!
We did it!
"Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again."
What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
Two dollars!
For one tooth?
"Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter."
I already lost all my baby teeth.
"Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?"
"What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's."
"Uh, Butters, could we have it?"
"Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth."
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
"Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?"
Well?
Oh my God!
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow.
"Dude, where's the money?"
"What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!"
Tell us what?!
Dude.
You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
"Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!"
"Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?"
"So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!"
The kid will never even know.
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
"Come on, Kyle!"
"Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  ""Tooth Fairy."""
"There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it."
This is the smartest business venture ever.
"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!"
"...Hey, you can't do that!"
Because that's what we're doing!
You scram! We were here first!
You woke him up!
Who's the Boss?
"Uuh, yeah."
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
"Well, uh-what do you mean?"
"What's a ""tooth trade?"""
Amazing.
Oh. Uh-I don't know.
How much do we get if we work for you?
We're in!
We all want double-desserts today!
"U-uh, Chef."
Chef!
CHEF!
We're not dealing drugs!
No!
"Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!"
"We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses."
"Dude, just stop thinking about it."
Kyle?
"Aw, shit."
What?
Really?
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
"Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns"
"Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please."
Two hours.
"Damn, dude."
"Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?"
"Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over."
"Dude, this isn't working."
"Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again!"
"I'm tired, Grandpa."
I don't know.  Whoa.
"Hurry up, you guys!"
"Dude, you're not gonna believe this."
Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.
Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
"Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first."
"Okay, hold it, hold it."
What?!
Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
They have nowhere else to go.  Please?
That's your dad?
"Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??"
No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on!
"Okay, let's try it again. Hup!"
"No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America."
Now what do we do?
"Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!"
The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
"Yeah! Well, not this time!"
"We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!"
"Uh, sure, you can all get overtime."
Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
"Come on, angry mob!"
Yeah.
"Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways."
Whatever happened to Kenny?
"Dude, did you do all your homework last night?"
I know!
"Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded."
But he is-
He doesn't have to do homework?
I've got ADD.
"Dude, it's Timmy."
"Yeah, Timmy ruhules!"
But he's funny.
He looks pretty happy to me.
"Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is."
"Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff."
Because we're on Ritalin.
Oh boy oh boy.
"But there are no side effects, Chef."
See what?
Let's watch something else.
Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
"Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter."
Sounds good.
"Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny."
"Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?"
"Sure was, Dad."
"Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice."
I feel... different.
Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
"Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!"
"No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!"
"Dude, I don't understand this game at all."
"Um, deny it?"
Sweet.
"Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS."
"You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!"
"Oh, man, that's terrible."
"Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah."
Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
We're making faces at sick people.
We don't know.
"You're not more mature than us, Cartman!"
Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
"Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature."
"We got invited too, fatass!"
This is boring.
That seems kind of... weird.
Yeah.
Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
"Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide!"
"Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out."
"Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you."
"And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?"
Here!
"Dude, what the hell was that?"
"...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk."
You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
He's fakin'!
"Now, that's a get-well card!"
"Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?"
"Go on, Butters!"
"Butters, go on!"
"Dude, you really are sick, huh?"
"Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?"
"Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?"
What?
Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
Don't be a smartass?
"Hi, doctor."
"Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick."
But I don't think it's working.
Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
"...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care."
"Who?  Oh, shit."
"Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question."
"Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life."
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
"His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working."
Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
"But you only need one, fat boy!"
"Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!"
Oh my God!
"Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!"
"What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!"
"Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here."
You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
"Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't."
Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
"Nobody wants to listen, Kenny."
"I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again."
"I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live!"
"Come on, where are they?"
This is it??
This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
"Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!"
We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney.
"Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy."
Sshhh!
"If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?"
"Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!"
"Oh, phew."
"Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here..."
"...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!"
"You suck, Cartman!"
"God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!"
"There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!"
"My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend..."
Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again!
So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
"That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan."
"Dude, please. Kyle needs it."
"Alright, alright, here."
You look a lot better.
"Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do."
"Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!"
"It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney."
"Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?"
"Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches."
You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
"Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it."
"Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag."
Islam??
"Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed."
"Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is."
"But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about."
"Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!"
"I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side."
"Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints."
Do you think they should change the flag?
That was a good one.
"Wait, I don't get it."
Boy band?
"Dude, we don't have any musical talent."
He's right.
"Well, I guess."
"Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall."
"Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it."
Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
"Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that."
"Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski."
"Aw, come on, dude. Let her try."
"Come on, nobody's gonna notice."
She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
"Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?"
Costumes?
"Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?"
"Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways?"
Kenny says that's not what it means.
"Uh oh, mall cops."
"Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager."
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
We are making a music video.
"Dad, I was just a--"
"Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?"
"Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting."
No.
Dad!
"It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?"
"Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me."
"I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--"
Dad? What the hell is going on?
Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
...Oh-kay.
Dad?
"Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had."
Yeah.
Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
Really?
Alright!
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
"Oh, yes we do."
"You were great, Dad."
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
I don't think they sell those anymore.
Bo-ring.
"Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."""
"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"""
"Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school."
We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn!
Are we gonna go to hell?
What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
But crackers are his- body.
"Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him."
No??
Confession?
"Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days."
And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
Have you confessed all your sins yet?
"Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period."
"Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?"
"What, Butters?"
"Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something."
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-"
"Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!"
The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
"...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-"
God damnit!
"Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?"
We have a question.
Where do handicapped people go when they die?
"But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?"
What happened??
I don't think so.
Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on.
"Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more."
Cartman!
"Dude, you just said ""ass""! That's a sin!"
"Oh, shit!  Oh!"
But what about them?
"Okay, come on."
Come on! This stupid light won't change.
We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
"Uh, come on, let's go."
"...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
He's doomed.
Oh no! It's locked!
Confession box is over there!
You're a sinner!
"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?"
Pamphlet. Pamphlet.
Let's go.
...they've killed Kenny!
"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?"
"Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs."
What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
"Wow, cool."
Yeah!
What?
Kenny?!  What's he say?
"Dude, that seems kind of... weird."
What worked?
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
"Well, what about going to hell and all that?!"
"Dude, I an so disillusioned right now."
Yeah!
"Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade."
"Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here"
What grade are you going into?
Stupid third grader!
Denver?
"Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical!"
"Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" all together!"
"...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters."
"Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"""
"We got you covered, Timmy."
"Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language."
"...More like, Ms. Makesmesick."
What a bitch!
This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
"Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!"
We travel back in time.
It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
"We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there."
Back in the third grade.
Oh! Here she comes.
Yeah!
"Timmy, you have to stop!"
No??
"So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?"
My God!
"Over here, over here!"
Less than 20 minutes?!
"Well, who didn't see that coming?"
"...nine, eight..."
Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
W-what did you get in a fight about?
"Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!"
"Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!"
"God-damnit, this is ridiculous."
"Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?"
I know.
Wait a minute! I've got it.
"Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!"
"Oh, son of a bitch!"
Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
Dude. Sh-she's right.
"Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!"
"Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us."
"Dude, what's your little brother doing here?"
But isn't he only three years old?
Cool!
"Wow, cool!"
"Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus."
But they smell like pee.
Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
"Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?"
"Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid."
Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper!
What the hell just happened?
"Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?"
"Wow, that's amazing."
"What do you think, Officer Barbrady?"
"Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!"
Yes!
"So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?"
Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
"Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!"
Cartman!
"Yeah, that's fine.  No, wait!"
Can I do it?
"Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!"
"Well, yeah, or we could just kill him."
He's right there.
Uh-oh.
"Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves."
"Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper!"
"Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom."
You break it down!
"Not it! You lose, Kenny."
"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
Then we have to stop it before it gets there!
"Cartman, you have to stop!"
He is in there.
"One-two-three, not it!"
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
"No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell."
"This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!"
He did it!
"You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!"
"Huh, that's a bitch."
"Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!"
Cartman!
"'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do."
E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
Uh-eally? Uh you think so?
"Oh yeah, we can't!"
You do?
"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
"No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay."
"Where's Gobbles, Timmy?"
"No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me."
Helen!
Oh no!
"Okay, here we go."
We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
"I can't do it, dude."
Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
That's so gross.
I'll throw in five.
forty-one bucks.  Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!
Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick.
"Well, at least you got it out of your system."
"Oh, you guys!"
"You know, dude, there might be something to this."
We knew he wouldn't make it.
I don't believe it.
Did you like the old one?
"We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing."
What's a prostitute?
"Chef, what's a prostitute?"
"Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"
"Chef, what's a prostitute?"
Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
Like what?
No.
Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
"Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?"
You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
I know!
"Deal, druggie!"
"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of."
Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
"Well, of course your parents said you can't go!"
"Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it."
The police?
But what do the police do to them?
"Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too."
What's going on?
...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
"You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes."
How come you wanna help the fatass?!
"You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!"
"You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?"
"If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?"
Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
"Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli."
"And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word."
"Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider."
The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry.
"So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die."
"We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago."
Yes. No foolies.
Awesu-home!
"No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!"
"It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight."
Parents?
"He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around."
"Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!"
"Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner."
"Hey, you guys came back!"
Huh.
I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
A-ah huh.
Ho-o-oh.
"What is this all about, Kyle?"
"I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore."
Nobody's paying any attention.
This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
"Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing."
How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
"And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this."
"What, dude?"
We don't know anything about animation.
"Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"""
"It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget."
Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
"That's not me, that's you!"
"No, that's okay."
"Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending."
Hey!  Wait a minute!
"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?"
"Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs."
"You guys, knock it off! We have to record this!"
What's awesome?
That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
Easy.
"Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas"
Okay.  One.
Kickass!
"Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas."
E mouths...
1  2.
"""We wish you a m- Merry"""
AAAAAAAA!
"That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!"
"We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!"
"Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!"
We love
Tralala
We sit.
Tralalalala
"""Awgh! I'm so fat!"""
"""Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"""
"Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!"
Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew!
We wish
Tralalalala
We sit.
Tralalalala
...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film.
Hey!  Wait a minute!
"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?"
"(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!"
You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
For nothing.
"Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing."
No not ham!
...Christmas is about something much more important!
Presents.
"Don't you see, Kyle?"
Presents.
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
Wow! Count me in!
What?
"Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool."
So?
What?!
"They can't say ""shit"" on television!"
Holy fucking shit!
"Aw, come, on dude! This is history."
Sh!
"Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say ""shit?"""
"Where are you going, Kyle?"
"But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say ""shit"" and you're gonna miss it!"
Oh.
I can't believe they actually said it.
"Wow! We can say ""shit"" in school now?!"
Me neither.
"This sucks. Now that ""shit""'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore."
What's meecrob?
What?
What's that?
"What's the Black Death, Chef?"
"Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here."
Word of curse?
Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
Holy shit!
Uh oh.
"Now what are we gonna do, Chef?"
Oh shit!
What are we supposed to do with it?
It might hold the key to a curse.
"Dude, we need help from the British!"
You know what it is?
"Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew ""curse word"" meant... curse word."
"Look, there's the F-word."
All the world destroyed?
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
"And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English."
Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!
Holy shi-  poop.
"It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know."
"Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad."
"Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??"
"Hey, it's Big Gay Al!"
"See ya, Dad!"
"Jimmy's funny, dude."
"Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?"
"Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?"
"Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time."
"You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!"
"We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!"
"And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!"
"Cartman, don't say ""use him"", you big silly goose."
"I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose."
"Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-"
...Asshole.
"Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy!"
"Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!"
Kicked out? Oh no!
"Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week."
What do we want?
When do we want it?
What do we want?
When do we want it?
What do we want?
When do we want it?
What do we want?
When do we want it?
"Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures."
"Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit!"
"That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!"
"Dude, this looks like it could get ugly."
"Jesus Christ, dude!"
We did it! We did it!
Huh?
"So wait, did we do good?"
"Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts!"
"Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay."
What's going on?
How'd he do that??
No way!
His a-miracles?
Yeah!
"Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea."
"No, I'm Stan."
Who are you?
"Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here."
"Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home."
I don't care! I'm leaving!  'Scuse me.
I'm going home.
You said we're free to leave whenever we want
Move out of the way.
"I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave."
"That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay."
"Okay, it's all clear."
We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
"Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!"
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
"No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!"
"Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!"
"Oh wait, who am I again?"
"Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!"
"Kyle, please. You-  You're my best friend."
HaaAAAA!
"Hi, Jesus. It's me,"
This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
"I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special."
Can you do it again?
That's it? That's how you did that trick?
"That trick sucks, Jesus."
"Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out."
"But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick."
Then what are we going to do.
Super best friends?
To where?
I am ready.
Yeah.
"So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?"
Wow.
I knew it.
"Wow, the Moses."
Kyle! Kyle!
"Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
"Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
Kyle!
"Kyle, you can't kill yourself!"
"Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny!"
"Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all."
"Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle."
What's no big deal?
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
He's lying.
"We don't wanna see them, Cartman!"
What??
"Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable."
"When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!"
One please.
"Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?"
"Oh my God, he killed Kenny."
Got what all figured out?
Yeah.
"This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman."
"Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?"
"Jesus Christ, dude!"
Who are you?
Good call.
"Oh man, this is another rerun."
Because I had an itch up my ass.
When are they gonna make new ones?
What's this?
Enough! I know!
Dude! Did you get 'em?
Yep. Tomorrow night.
"Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night."
"No, dude, we really, really do."
Huh?
"Yeah, he looks terrible."
Uuuuhh.
Phillip? That's not Phillip.
"Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us."
It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
"Man, this sucks!"
I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
"We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here."
But where's Phillip?
"Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip."
What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
"Oh no, dude."
"They're not together anymore, dude."
But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
"Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end?"
Phillip! Phillip!
Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
"Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-"
But we need you!
"He'll do it, dude."
Two thousand dollars.
"Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there."
I'm sure they'll be here any minute.
Oh my God!
"Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first."
Fine!
"Okay. Okay, I think we lost them."
"Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason."
Go! Run run run!
"Come on, Kenny, hurry up!"
They're back!
It sure did.
"""There you are, Jennifer Lopez!""  ""You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."""
"""It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez."""
"Yeah, awesome!"
"Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)"
...Why?
"You'd better not be lying, Kenny."
Oh my God.
"Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?"
"Yeah, it's unbelievable."
"Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money."
"Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?"
"Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--"
"Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already."
"Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start."
What's that?
"Heh, heh.  Sorry."
"Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins."
"That does it, dude!"
We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not!
"Come on, dude!"
"Aw, crap."
Dude!
"Alright, let's go."
"You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!"
You'll see! We'll get in!
"Dude, are you okay?"
"Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in."
Jesus.
"Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!"
"It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!"
"AGGH!  This isn't over, Cartman!"
"Kyle, you gotta see!!"
"Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?"
"Then damnit man, do it!"
"Look, Kyle. Look."
Kyle!
"Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it."
"""So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"""
"""That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures"""
"""Scream for me, bitch!"""
"Oh no, what now?"
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
"Whoa, cool!"
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
"Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?"
Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!
But it's super-cool!
"Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket."
"Red rocket, red rocket!"
"I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket."
My room? Why?
No!
Why?! What's the big deal?!
"I was doing ""red rocket"" to make the dog's milk come out."
Huh??
What things??
No!
"Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?"
It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
"Yeah.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get-"
"You guys, we just wanna know if you-"
Why?
...A what?
"Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything."
"But Wendy, we don't understand how that-"
"Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick."
"Yeah, we need condoms!"
Why does that matter?
"Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side."
Doesn't it give any other directions?
"Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!"
How do you feel?
"Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on."
"Man, this condom's driving me crazy."
From sex??
All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
"Yeah, come on guys, this is war!"
Ha! They're your diseases!
That does it! Attack!
We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
"But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?"
"Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?"
"HA, I blew your head off!"
"Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?"
"Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet."
"Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!"
"Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom."
"What is it, Mom?"
The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
There it is. The Okama GameSphere.
What's that?
"Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!"
What?
"Dude, we got GameSphere."
What?
...O-kay.
No.
"G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere."
"Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!"
"Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball."
"Okay, we will."
"Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!"
"No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer."
"Oh, uh, I'm sick."
But Mom...
Can't believe we have to go to school!
We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere.
Fine.
This is gonna be one looong-ass day.
That was the longest day of school ever!
It... it was right here.
Hello?
What? Who-who is this?
Don't hurt it!
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
Towelie!
"I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him."
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
"Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!"
"Come on, dude!"
They said the gas station outside of town.
Who is that?
"'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games."
You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
"Goddamnit, what now?!"
"Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere."
Where is our Okama GameSphere?
"Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?"
"Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys."
"A little more gas, Kenny."
"Brake, Kenny, brake."
"Dude, don't you remember where it is?"
"Alright, so where is it?"
"Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!"
What?
"Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?"
We don't care.
"Dude, we don't care."
We... don't... care.
"Don't care, don't care, don't care."
"Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please?"
"We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?"
Yeah.
What?
"So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?"
"Hurry up, stupid parachute!"
"Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks."
"Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter."
"No, Towelie, the entry code!"
"God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence."
Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
"Oh God, don't care, don't care."
So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
But we don't care!
We're just going in to get our video game back.
"Hello? Hello, anybody here?"
"Ohmigod, look!"
"Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays."
"Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!"
"Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart!"
"Aw, crap!"
"Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!"
"Oh, dude, we finished level 50!"
"Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level."
"Butters, what the hell are you doing?"
"Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!"
There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
"Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'."
"Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!"
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;-i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?
Well alright.
We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
"Oh, it's just a goat."
"Hey there, little guy."
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
"Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle."
Kenny?
My parents will never let me keep a goat
"No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat."
"Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?"
They're not.
"Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them."
I don't care! We're going!
"Okay, thanks, Towelie."
"Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!"
"Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes."
"Okay, it's clear. Come on!"
"Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys."
"Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions."
"'K, let's put him on here."
"Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours."
"Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan."
Twenty hours!
"Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address."
Hey look! There's a taxi!
Hello. We need to go...  here.
I think so.
"A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?"
Here. Wu-we don't want it.
"No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat."
"Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift."
"Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America."
"Hey! Hey, open the door!"
How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
"Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad."
What?  Howdy.
"Cartman, you stupid asshole!"
You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies!
"Dude, these people are insane."
"Hey, what are you guys doing here?"
"Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war."
But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
"...He's got us there, dude."
"Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all."
"Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too."
"Come on, let's go get to the plane."
"No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium."
Go America.
"Yeah, go Broncos."
I didn't smile.
Did you go yet?
What's he want?
"Goddamnit Cartman, what?!"
"That isn't funny, Cartman."
"...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son."
No way!
"Cartman, where are you going??"
Oh boy.
Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
"Yeah, you missed them turning around."
What?
"Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's."
How the hell should we know?
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
"But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!"
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
"Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!"
"Hey, you're laughing, Cartman."
Huh?
"Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse."
"Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them."
"Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here."
Hey dude.
What the hell was that?
"I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass."
"Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype."
"Book. Later, dude."
"Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is."
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home.
"So dude, did Cartman's idea work?"
Damn!
"Yeah, haha."
"Your family is rich, dude."
"Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table."
"Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?"
"Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway."
What's that?
DVD? We don't own a DVD player.
"Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do."
"I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play."
"I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman!"
"Oh hey, there's Token."
"Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?"
"Sure, dude, you're our friend."
"Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you."
"Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew."
"Yeah, I get it for that."
"Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore."
"Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic."
Well that burned a long time.
"Oh dude, there goes one."
"What, Butters?"
Tell him we're busy.
"Alright, let's go see what he wants."
What?
A boat?
"Well WHAT, Cartman?"
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!"
Stem cells?
"Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again."
"The principal? Aw, come on!"
Wait. What's going on here?
Well how sick?
"...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?"
"Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better."
...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!!
Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!
I-
"I can't, I just can't."
"I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing."
"And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!"
Just leave me alone!
"I'm not the one who's leaving, he is!"
Hey Chef.
Bad.
"Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?"
"But then, why does God give us anything to start with?"
I think I understand.
"Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now."
"Hey, Kenny!  Oh no.  No."
"But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?"
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend.
"What, Cartman? What's happened?"
"This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?"
"Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was!"
Butters was missing?
"Damn, dude."
"Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you."
Really?
"Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!"
Hey Kenny
"We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny!"
What kind of help?
I'll bet you can.
"Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass."
Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
"He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster."
"You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters."
"Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls"
Marry him?
"Chef, we need more food."
"Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed."
"How do you feel, Butters?"
"Alright, now it's time for phase 2."
"We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world."
Did you bring the camera?
That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!
Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
All prepared for liposuction surgery?
"Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters."
"Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault."
We've gotta hurry this up.
He's losing weight.
"Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home."
"Dude, bail!"
"Come on, Butters. Time to go."
What?
...Kenny would have done it.
"Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters."
That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
What?!
Wait. Everyone hates Jared now?
"Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out."
"No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have ""AIDS,"" AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides."
"Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?"
Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!
Oh God-damnit!
Why?
"Well, so much for our money."
He's such a douchebag
"Yeah, and then what?"
They're still asleep.
What's a Hitler?
"No, I never have."
Smell what?
"Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess."
Uhh... no.
Stan. Marsh.
"Dude, I'm just learning."
I never said I was.
...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
Oh no.
Heather?
...who are you people?!
"All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?"
Okay.
"Yeah, prob'ly"
Fries... fries...
"Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with."
Thanks. Who are you?
I' seems fine.
Don't care.
I dunno.
"Oh,. God."
"Gah, let's go you guys."
"Dude, what the hell is your problem?!"
"I raced you, You won!"
What?
"I'll be there, you queen!"
Yeah!
"Dude, I have to!"
"Dude, he's got Heather!"
"I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?"
...Thank you.
"This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!"
That does it! I'm calling the police!
"Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13."
"I have to do this, okay? I have to!"
Pizza... pizza... pizza...
Thanks.
Where the hell have you guys been?!
No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks!
"Hm, that sounds pretty good."
Hey Kenny!
"Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on."
Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
What disease should we say?
What?
This is gonna be so funny!
"We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?"
"It has to be you, Butters. Think about it."
Kenny woulda done it.
"Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand."
Where's you get the balls from?
Wow!
"All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I"
"That's your flight, Butters."
"Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV."
Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend!
Here he comes.
"But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!"
"Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?"
"Yeah, they wanted to find you bad."
I- told them where to find you.
"Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over."
Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
"Yeah, I wouldn't have."
"Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them."
"Pst, Cartman."
"Cartman, wake up!"
"We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!"
"So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!"
"We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together."
"Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!"
Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
"Go on, dude it's the only way."
"Just do it really fast, and we can go."
"Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!"
"Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?"
"Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta."
"I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you."
"Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here."
They aren't leaving.
"Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back."
"Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house."
I don't know.
"We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys."
We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
Butters!  Did you bring it?
What?
Aw crap!
That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
"They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die."
No!
You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer!
Kiss my ass!
"I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing."
"Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now."
"Shut up, Cartman."
Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
"Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this."
"This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe."
Round one is over. We made it.
"Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in."
Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes!
"No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!"
"Wait, what is that?  Dude!"
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
Wha?
"Dude, what are you guys doing?"
You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
"That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!"
"No, this is exactly what we wanted."
"Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people."
...I don't believe it.
Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me!
What are they doing here?
"Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores."
No!
Hello?
"Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?"
What do I say??
"Cartman, no!"
O-ogh...
It... did?
Pick me up. I... I want to see.
"We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!"
"Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas."
This is gonna be so awesome!
"Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!"
"Alright, here we go."
"Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!"
"No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC!"
"It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!"
But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
"But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe."
"Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!"
"O-K, deal."
"Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch."
"Dude, I'm not going."
Stan.
"Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?"
They look fine to me.
That's worse!
Dude!
"Dude, the commercials could start any time!"
Get all the stuff!
We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on!
Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!
"Huff, huff"
Aww!
AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on!
"Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?"
We made it!
Here they come!
I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
"Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon."
Oh God-dammit!
"Come on, we gotta go somewhere else!"
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
We made it.
But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
"Come on, we gotta get to a TV!"
Commercial Break Number Two!
I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
"Oh, God, it's horrible!"
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
"Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!"
Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
She has to!
Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
What?
The last commercial break has to be coming on any second!
"We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??"
"Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later!"
We made it!
"Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??"
"Wait a minute! Look!  ""The following preview has..."" This is it! This is it!"
That looks AWEsome!
"Oh, dude, let's go!"
I wonder if it's all a western?
"Okay, here he comes."
"Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere."
"All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place."
So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
"All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck."
"Okay, next?"
"Yeah, it's not bad. Next?"
"Shut up, fatass!"
I like it.
"Okay, let's try this."
"Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend?"
"Oh, this is giving me a headache."
"You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?  He's quiet and he takes direction well."
How about Token?
That's great.
Suckup.
"Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek."
Just put it between his eyes.
"Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?"
"Oh, hey Butters."
Uh oh.
"Alright, I'll chip in."
Ready. Let's see 'em.
Are they playing basketball?
"Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish."
What are we gonna do with them?
"Yeah, that'd be funny."
"Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened."
"Oh jeez, change the channel."
"They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!"
We're dead!
"Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!"
"Chef, we did something kind of bad."
We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
So what should we do?
This is it.
"Yeah, stupid."
"Dude, it's probably in her stomach."
What do we do now?
Do you see the sea people.
Yeah.
Aaah!
Let's go!
The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
...and then we put them back in the tank.
"Okay. Goodnight, Cartman."
"Oh no, what now?"
Wow. How did that happen?
They've already accomplished so much.
"Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture."
"Well, drop them in!"
That's cool.
"Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home."
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
Hm.
"Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come."
"Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything."
"Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue!"
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
That sounds pretty fun.
What are they talking about?
"Um, cool."
...Like ...money? What?
What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts?
"We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts."
We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
What?
Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
"You've had five, dude!"
"Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth."
What? He did.
Yeah it does.
Yeah. It does.
So?
"Dude, look."
Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
"Oh, cool. A preview."
"Aw, dude, why would they do that?"
That's gay.
Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
"Goddamnit, that pissed me off!"
"Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!"
We have to do something. Let's form a club.
"No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!"
Well what's wrong with it?
"Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats."
What?
"Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!"
"Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats."
"Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause."
"Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone."
"You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?"
"Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors?"
"Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!"
"Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat."
"...212, 213, 214 members!"
Really? That's great.
"If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films."
When did we do dibs for it?
"Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?"
"Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary?"
That is our understanding.
"It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies."
Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves."
"Okay, go."
Over here!
"Aw, really?"
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
"So we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song"
"Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films."
"You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours."
Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
"Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys!"
He's definitely lost it
"You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it."
"Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes!"
"Yuh, you guys okay."
"Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here."
"Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world."
"Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it."
"Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again."
"Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?"
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
"Ah, hey, Bebe."
"Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us."
Hellafun
"Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe."
"That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool."
"So what you do, see, is wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing."
"Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-"
Hoh hoh hoh!
"...Wait, what were we doing again?"
"Hey, that's what I wrote about!"
"Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde."
That's such a great paper!
Yeah.
Uh huh.
That would be best.
Kyle??
"Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!"
No!
Yeah!
"Sure thing, Bebe."
Yeah.  Where are you guys going?
Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
Hoh!
"Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together."
Is Bebe home?
Cartman's?
Hoh!
"Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh!"
"Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!"
Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh!
Hoh. Hoh?
Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta.
Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
"Ahta. Ah, ahta!"
Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta.
Ahah
Ahta?
Friend. Ahta.
Ahta!
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
"I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us."
I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.
Child Tracker?
"...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!"
I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
Huh?
"But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun."
I'm not done with my pizza.
"Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker."
But why do I have to leave?
Where are we supposed to go?
"Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid."
"Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai."
"Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude."
"Uh huh, Stan Marsh."
"Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ."
We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
We've gotta find that ticket!
"You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it."
Where's Kenny??
"Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure."
Did you get it?
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
I can't see.
It wa a trick!
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over!
"Cartman, come on!"
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
"We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven."
Because we wanna see Kenny again.
Mr. Garrison threw away his car?
"Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!"
"Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with."
"We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood."
No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??
"No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off."
What??
Hey Kenny.
"Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??"
Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
"No, we have to see Kenny!"
Cremated? What's that?
"Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!"
"Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny!"
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!
"Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it."
Where??
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
"Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done."
"Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels..."
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
"Dude, come back here!"
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
"Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!"
How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
"Good job, wizard."
My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace.
We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
Woww.
We have come to reclaim the one tape!
"No, we have to return it!"
"Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too."
"Nothing.  Hey, kid!"
Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
"Oh crap, dude!"
Ogh.
"Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders."
We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
"Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange."
"But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too."
"Uh, wellâWait, what'd you see?"
What do we do with it?
I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.
"No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?"
True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
Jimmy didn't stop them!
Just get across the river! They're coming!
"Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river."
This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
Where?!
"Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!"
Closed?
"Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!"
They're coming!
Uh-oh.
"Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video."
...Wow.
"Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body."
"No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher."
"Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay."
"Yeah, I have to remember that."
I guess.
"Oh, no, no, no no no no."
"Chef, we're intolerant."
"Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him."
Are we homophobes now?
N-no?
We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
Tolerance camp?
"Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures."
"The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!"
Butters!
Jesus... we have to get out of here.
"Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die."
"Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago."
"No, that's Kenny."
That's Cartman.
"Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives."
Awesome!
"Uh, over here please?"
We told you that.
"No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body."
Heh hey wait a minute dude.
He seemed better on TV?
"Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you?"
We don't get to go to Scotland?
"Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso."
That's us. Come on.
Huh?
"Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually."
"Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave."
What??
"Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap!"
"Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please."
"I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick."
Jesus Christ.
"Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up."
"Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real."
"Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life."
"Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called ""intuition."" Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun."
"No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real."
"No dude, you're a douche."
Then you're a stupid douche
I'm nine years old.
"You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch."
Kyle! Kyle!
"Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche."
"Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called ""cold reading."" They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them."
"No, he's not."
"Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?"
"Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?"
"Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you."
"Does this month, November, hold a special significance?"
"Right, because he's saying, ""Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"""
"See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man."
"I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday."""
"Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money."""
"No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about."
What?!
No wait.
"Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter."
"No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, ""Peter was your husband?"""
Stop it! I didn't do anything!
"I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, ""They want me to acknowledge Peter."" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, ""I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely"""
Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally!
"Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience."
"Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead!"
"No, I don't think either of us can."
"I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!"
"Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!"
"Fine, douche!"
"No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience."
"You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole?  We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche."
Yeah.
"There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself."
"No, it can't be."
"Oh, dude!"
Now do you people believe me?
What's going on?
So throw it away.
"You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations."
It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
"Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal."
"Aw, come on, Mom."
"It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!"
"Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?"
I'm me from the past?
"Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!"
What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no!
Stop it.
No.
Quit it.
Hey guys.
This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
"Shut up, Cartman!"
God-damnit!
"Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters."
"I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him."
I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
"Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?"
"Dude, how long has your future self been around?"
Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
Where is he now?
Liver medicine?
"Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!"
"Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane?"
"Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?"
"Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters."
Here it is. Motivation Corp.
"Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go."
What the hell is going on here?
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
They've all been lying to us this whole time!
"Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!"
"They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!"
"It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!"
Who's that?
What?
We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
"...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care."
"But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to!"
"No, we gotta run away somewhere warm."
"Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing."
"Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?"
"Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?"
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.  That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
"Fine, then you can come with me."
I guess this is it.
"Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?"
Cartman??
What the hell are you doing here?!
"God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go."
"Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!"
How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
How much is this going to cost us?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah!
"That's not neato, that sucks."
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
"Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!"
Dude!
"No, that's too extreme!"
"Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing!"
Hey future self.
"You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?"
You must know what I'm talking about.
"Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future."
"No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across."
What?
"Hide and go seek, huh?!"
I don't believe that he's my future self!
"No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear."
But I have to know for sure.
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
Yes?
AAAH!
"That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake."
Butters!
"Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here."
"Butters, we're running away!"
"Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change!"
Huh?
Get the fuck out of here.
"Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!"
"I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!"
"I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning."
"Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby."
"Cartman, why are you doing this?"
"Wuh, that smells."
"Uh, I don't really wanna get on there."
I don't know.
Awww!
"God, it took forever!"
"Hang on, Santa!"
Why would Iraqis do that? Why?
Oh no.
"Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!"
"I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead."
"Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!"
We're here.
"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus.
"Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh..."
"RPG, four o'clock!"
We brought Christmas to Iraq!
"Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls!"
"Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas."
"Oh, hey Kenny."
"Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal."
"Dude, sweet!"
Dude! Visitors!
"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!"
Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
"No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?"
"I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream."
"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?"
"Chef, we're in a repeat."
It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
"You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes."
"Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times."
You all right?
"Where to now, Chef?"
What?
Go on.
"Oh, nice going, Cartman!"
We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
What do we do???
Let's go!
What is that?
Chef! End of the road!
It's the police!
Chef!!
Uh.  Wugh. You guys. Wake up!
We're in the alien ship.
Guys. Look.
"My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space."
Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
Dad?
"Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact."
"Okay okay, take the form of something else!"
"Nno, that's stupid too."
No!
I like it.
"You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?"
Television?
Our planet is just a reality-TV show?
Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
"Oh shit, did we do that?"
"Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!"
"Please, take us to them! Please!"
"Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?"
"Uh, Earth?"
"Look, we just want to talk to you about the show."
"But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other."
"Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us."
"Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!"
"Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-"
"Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong."
"No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!"
"I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent."
"Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders."
"Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude."
"Yeah dude, not cool."
"Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one."
"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy."
"That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one."
"Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one."
"Stay clear, guys, stay clear."
"Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one."
"Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads."
See?
Mrs. Streible thinks she's so cool!
Like what?
"Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!"
D'you think that's enough?
Okay.
Is this the right house?
"Kyle, we all agreed to do this!"
"Let's go, Kyle!"
"Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together."
We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
"Yes, dude!"
"Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody."
What about him?
Butters.
So what should we do?
"... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!"
"Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?"
"Cartman, what are you doing?"
"You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!"
They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
Butters?
He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
"It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess."
"Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same!"
"What is it, Cartmam?"
"Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final."
"You, you do? How?"
Wugh! Two weeks of this!
Let's go see a movie!
Uh... war?
Yeah.  War is not my voice.
You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
"No, you just have to study."
"Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!"
How?!
Cartman?
Oh no...
"Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea."
Aww crap.
"I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!"
"Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-"
"Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war."
"Oh, no, nononono."
"Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-"
"Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!"
"Uh, we didn't do it."
"Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-"
He does?
Can't be
What the hell are they doing now?
"Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!"
What are you gloating about?
What's the matter?
What's she doing?
"I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it."
"Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?"
"Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you."
"All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything."
"It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it."
"Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?"
Have you reported this to any other authorities?
We're on the case.
Detective McCormick found something interesting.
"You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody."
His plan was to use a hammer.
"Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head."
The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub.
Just the news.
"Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady."
"Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar!"
Yes it is!
"All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny."
"You got it, Ken?"
"Put that away, dude!"
"Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure."
"Hey, kid, what are you doing?"
Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
Aw crap!
Son of a bitch stupid FBI!
No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.
We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.
It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
"Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down!"
South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
I don't know.
"Dude, we just can't tell on them."
Jesus! They're gonna kill her!
"Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here!"
We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
We go get the doll ourselves.
That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
"Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!"
Did so!
We got it.
"Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?"
"We do what we can, sir."
Sure.
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama.
"Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?"
Damn.
"Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-"
We just wanna be junior detectives.
"It'll get better, guys."
"Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?"
"I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?"
"You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow."
"Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff."
No thanks.
Thanks.
...I think I have a better idea.
"Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please."
"Wow, dude."
"Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here."
"We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!"
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars!
We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
"Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!"
Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
No!
"I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!"
"Look, we- we've got nothing to lose."
Dad.  Good luck.
Come on! Come on!
"They, they had it! They freakin' had it!"
You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!
What???
"You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans!"
"Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!"
"Come on, you guys! This is our town!"
We can stay. And fight.
"Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys!"
No! We won't let you destroy our town!
"Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life."
This land is not for sale.
"It's all right, dad."
"She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer."
You're gonna be all right.
"No, Dad, NO."
What can I do?
"Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!"
"Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-"
"Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?"
An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.
"Ah! Oh, dude!"
"Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite."
"Dude, who the hell are you?"
"Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night."
"So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top."
I know!
"Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll."
"You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend."
"Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??"
"Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover!"
"Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!"
All right. Let's work it!  What the...?
Hey Craig.
These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
"Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!"
We're metrosexual!!
Dude! W-what are you doing?
We're not straight! You're straight!
"Wow, is that from Origins?"
"Well, what can we do about it?"
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
"Yeah. Wait, what?"
"Hey, what's goin' on?"
"Wow, we look great!"
"You'd better shut up, Craig."
It is not!
"Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!"
"Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?"
"Yeah. It's cool, holmes."
"Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us."
"Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band."
"Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented."
See what?
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
Hey dude.
"No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!"
You got a computer?
"See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!"
"Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too."
What the hell is that?
"We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!"
"Boy, I'll say!"
"Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice."
Oh yeah.
It is??
"Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity."
What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
"Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough."
"Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!"
"I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band."
What??
Is this for real?? This is for real!
"Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert."
"So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'im?"
I thought albums win either gold or platinum.
Hm. Guess he got what he deserved.
"Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?"
But they kill people.
"I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die."
What is that?
I think so.
What is he saying?
Oh Jesus!
"Dad, I'm scared."
I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
"Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving."
"Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa."
What's that?
The American Association of Retired Persons.
Hey Dad.
"Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?"
"No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?"
"All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office."
"Yeah, I remember hearing about that."
All right!
We did it!
"...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in."
"Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!"
"Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it."
"And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine."
"Dude, I hate my family."
"Dude, I wonder where Kyle is."
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
What's Casa Bonita?
"Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us."
"Yeah, it's kinda weird."
Yeah.
"Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there."
Really?
"Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do."
I knew he'd turn up.
"Cartman, stop it!"
"Yeah, screw that kid!"
"Wull, maybe he won't fight."
"All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass."
No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.
I'm gonna kick your ass...  bitch.
Huh?
"Dude, stop it."
"Shut up, Butters!"
I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.
He's a really nice kid.
What's that?
No.
The... Book of Mormon? What's that?
Who's Joseph Smith?
No!
What happened then?
"No, I was supposed to be home at eight."
...Hello?
"Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?"
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
That's not what the Harrisons said.
The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
"They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?"
But that's just you and your friends.
"Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is."
Yeah.
"So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?"
See? That's what happened to me!
"That's what they made me think, too!"
"Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented."
What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.
"Wow, you made this?"
"Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh..."
"Uh, no. I've got a lot to do."
Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.
What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
"Yeah, but... how?"
"Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?"
"It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri."
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
Hey Gary.
Dad!
Yeah.
...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
"No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?"
"No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!"
"I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!"
"Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!"
I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.
"You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me."
Oh brother.
I don't?
"Ugh, Jesus Christ!"
"Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one."
...Whoops.
"Mom...  Dad, it was just a-"
Hwat??
"Yeah, what's the problem?"
"Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand."
Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
Huh?
"Yeah, maybe you're right."
"What are you doing, Cartman?"
"Well, get away from us then."
"Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!"
Daaaad!
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.
"Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?"
Oh all right.
Why?
"So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks."
Yup.
"It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!"
"Well, I guess we learned our lesson."
"All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen."
Football.
"Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut!"
What?
"Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks."
"Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?"
'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
"Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?"
What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.
"Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy!"
"Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?"
"Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me."
She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
Well?
Over?  Jesus...
...Go away.
Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
"You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken..."
"Can we go, please?"
"No, dude, I feel worse!"
"Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!"
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control!
Something I should have done a long time ago.
"Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!"
"Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?"
I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
"But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?"
"All right, so how do I join you?"
...'K.
Yeah.
"There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped."
"The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-"
They're not?
Well I don't drink coffee.
Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul.
So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
...conformist.
Butters?
What's the matter with you?
Huh? But you just got dumped
"No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all."
"He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home."
"Hey, can I join in?"
"Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy."
Yeah. Let's play ball.
"Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action."
Sure dude.
"Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?"
"Dude, Cartman."
"Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way."
"Dad, don't get carried away."
"Whoa whoa, Cartman."
"Cartman, calm down!"
"It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined."
"Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures."
"No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?"
What's going on??
"Do something, Kyle!"
"You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore."
"All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!"
I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
"Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister."
What?
What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
Oh no!
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure.
"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
What is that?
Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year.
"Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East."
"Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas."
"Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet."
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
"We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year."
"Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked."
Kiya! Kiya!
"With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like."
"What's your ninja name, Kenny?"
"All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!"
"Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it."
"Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig!"
We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
"Hyeah, ""they're not that cool."" These are real authentic weapons from the Far East."
"Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do."
"Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state!"
"Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do."
"Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction."
"Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!"
"Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!"
"I dunno. Craig, is that you?"
"Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down."
"Yeah, huh, I got you!"
Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!
"Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!"
"Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really."
"Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay!"
"Dude, shut up!"
What?!
"Just stay still, Butters."
God dammit!
"We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?"
He's really old and going blind.
We might pass him off as our pet.
"All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened."
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
"Okay, it's clear."
"Oh shit, somebody's coming!"
Where'd you get those?
"Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going."
"Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay?"
"We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah!"
"Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters?"
"Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!"
"No dude, you gotta help us find him!"
Butters!
Butters!
Bad.
"Nothing, just... playing."
Butters!
What?
"Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back."
"It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them."
"All right, the county fair's still open!"
We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
"What is it, Craig?"
"Come on, Ninjas!"
"Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there."
"Good luck, Bulrog."
"Oh, Jesus."
What?
"Just run with it, dude."
Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
"Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do."
"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy."
"Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on."
So?
"That's really, really terrible, dude."
Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.
Things seem pretty quiet.
"Oh God, here we go again."
That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
"Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now."
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
Dude. That movie sucked.
How can they even call that a movie?
"That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back."
"Hey, we want our money back."
That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
"That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!"
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
"We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!"
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
"Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny!"
"Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! ""For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.."" Okay, okay, wait, here we go."
"Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion."
"No, no, no, no, we want our money back."
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
"Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!"
"Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!"
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
"Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!"
Wait a minute. Cartman?!
"Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!"
"We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!"
"Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded."
"Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny."
"Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?"
"Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money."
Tor- torture you?
We don't want to torture you.
"Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?"
"Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!"
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet!
"Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny?"
"All right, let's get the hell out of here!"
"Aah! Run, dude, run!"
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
"Oh, you've got to be shittin' me."
"Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up."
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna-
Yeah. I told you that!
"He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it."
"He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind."
It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!
"No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results."
"Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one."
"Chef, we just got served."
"Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-"
"Some, kids from Orange County."
No.
"But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'."
But Dad-
"Yeah, let's go race it right now!"
What?
I thought I was supposed to!
But why?
"I, I don't know. He seems all right."
"Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad."
"Okay, good."
God dammit!
"Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?"
"Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?"
"Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served."
"Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?"
Great!
"All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance."
The arcade?
"Dude, he's incredible."
"Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?"
Yeah.
"Dude, we need you."
It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
"All right, that's three!"
Huh?
Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
So you'll do it?
"All right, we just need one more person!"
What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...
"Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe."
It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago.
"But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska."
We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
"Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?"
"A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park."
"All right, so you're sure he can dance?"
"Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?"
"My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe."
"Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer."
"We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?"
Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like-
"I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you."
Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault
"Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that."
"Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant."
And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
"But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying ""Haha! I'm better than you!"" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man."
"Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies."
What?
What happened??
"Aw, what do we do, Chef?!"
Butters!
All right Butters!
"Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?"
"Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool."
"Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house."
What's that you're wearing?
"Whoa. Dude, no way!"
"Dude, are these all your toys?"
"Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something."
"Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!"
"I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons."
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
"Fine, Mom."
"No, my parents are."
What?
Kyle?
Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!
"Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!"
He just showed up here.
Jesus Christ!
I know. He's here.
"No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home."
"Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!"
Haaa!
Yeah. A really bad dream.  Oh Jesus!
"You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!"
"Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there."
"Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us."
"Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood."
"Stop, you fucking lunatic!"
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
"Blanket, you in here?"
"All right dude, get in his bed."
"Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something."
"Go, go, ruuun!"
Oh Jesus!
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
"Run, Blanket, Run!"
"Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?"
"Cartman, just keep your mouth shut."
Whoa.
"Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!"
"Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em."
"Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool."
"Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?"
"All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house."
Son of a bitch!
"It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!"
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh-
Who is that?
"Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!"
"Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away."
I wanted my job!
Timecist?
"People from the future. Right, got it."
That's right!
Can you speak in present-day English please?
"Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries."
"No, a double cheeseburger and fries!"
What?!
I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!
"No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!"
Aw- awwww!
"Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?"
They took yer jarb!!
"I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better."
"I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work."
We're doing it!
"Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second.  This is gay."
"Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile."
"But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!"
"This is bullcrap, dude!"
"Dude, I really don't care."
"Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?"
I'm not voting!
I just think this whole thing is stupid!
It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
"No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point."
"Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care."
Puff Daddy?
I...
"""Vote or Die""?  What the hell does that even mean?!"
Aaaah!
...Okay. I'll vote.
I guess...
Okay.
I'm voting.
"Yeah, I know."
I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
"Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!"
"Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!"
The whole thing is a joke!
B-bani-banishment?
"You-you're all joking, right?"
I'm not voting!
"Dad, isn't this a little extreme?"
Hello?
"Oh, thank God."
Awww!
What about me?
I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
"Wow, you guys really love animals."
I'll live with you.
He said I can stay.
"Ahh, no thanks, that's okay."
"I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do."
I can't. I was banished for not voting.
I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
I guess... I guess you're right.
Aaah!
Aaaah!!
I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
"Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!"
...What?
It's time for what?
"Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?"
"Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores."
Butters?
"Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town."
"Dad?  Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?!"
"Dad, oh my God!"
"What? D-dad, are are you dying?"
But you-your face!
"Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore."
"Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their-"
"But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-"
Dad!
"Dad, what are you doing?!"
"Dad, you're a geologist!"
Where are they?
"Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please."
"Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave."
"Dude, come on!"
"Dude, we have to go!"
"Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!"
"Goddamn, that took a long time."
Where's he?
There has to be a way!
Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
"No, dude, don't!"
"Save it, Grandpa!"
"Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart."
One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
What?!
"Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back!"
"Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?!  Dad!"
"Come on, Dad!"
"No, dad! We need your keys!"
There! The television department!
You?
We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
Me. I'm asking the question.
"Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?"
It's a mirror.
"Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart."
"H-Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!"
"Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!"
"Right now, goddamnit!"
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
Yeah! He just got paroled!
What the hell are we gonna do??
"Dude, let's play Fireman."
"Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!"
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
"Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time."
"Wow, cool!"
"Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire!"
We're heroes!
"Put it out, put it out!"
"Dude, we are in so much trouble!"
That's true.
No!
"Yeah, who cares?"
Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
"Sshhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now."
"Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge?"
"Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection."
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on!
"Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders."
We've come to... ask you for help.
Yeah.
What?!
"Dude, weak!"
No!
"You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class."
"But mom, my teacher will-"
But Mo-o-o-
This is hopeless!
"That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!"
"No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of."
How do you know?!
"All right, fine."
Excuse me!
"We, we got it."
"Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?"
"Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?"
"Dude, what happened?"
What's that?
We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
"No, no, we've just gotta find better help."
There is... one person.
Shelly?
"Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other."
"Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left."
"Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault."
"We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!"
Admit it was our fault?
"Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you."
"See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was ""Fireman."""
"Trent, look: We've realized our mistake!"
What is that?
"Yeah, who cares?"
"Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?"
And we're... cut! &gt;&gt; -&gt;-&gt;
"Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet."
...Craig's show??
But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
"Hey, look, Craig just walked in."
"Your idea took about this much thought, Craig!"
"Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!"
"Come on, guys!"
"All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show."
"Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good."
"We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders..."
Good!
"All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!"
"Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused."
"Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade."
"No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want."
I knew we could do it!
Craig's new show?
Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.
I don't believe it.
"Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!"
"Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?"
"Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh."
Crab people?
"Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people."
"We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas."
"Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine."
I guess we'll just take all of 'em.
It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
"You guys. You guys, wake up!"
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
"You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long."
"No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!"
They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school!
Even in the girls' bathroom!
We showed the shocking footage to the principal!
"The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free."
"Gee, what a concidence."
Nobody has any ideas?
...Bail.
"Oh, thank God."
"Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman."
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof.
He's not gonna do it.
"Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!"
"Butters, Goddammit."
Call an ambulance.
What the hell?
It's... nice.
"Okay, okay."
"Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home."
Woof.
"Oh, whatta?"
What time is it?!
"You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow."
...What?
"All right, I'm going now."
Go away! Shoo!
Again?
"Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!"
"Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr!"
"Okay, there."
I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior?
Aw- awww!
It's dead.
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
"Wait, wha-what?"
"Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!"
But I thought you meant the Son of God!
Ugh.
Uuugh!
"No, no-no-no."
Leave me alone!!
"All right, all right, all right! God!"
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!
"Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH!"
Oh yeah.
Hello? Anybody in there?
"Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil."
"I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!"
"Well, you're mountain lions."
There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
What?!
"No, he didn't."
"No, he didn't!"
"No, he didn't!"
"Oh, Goddammit!"
"I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous."
"This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point."
"Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?"
Too late?! The hell is that?!
"It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!"
That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?!
"I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!"
"Dude, what the-&#160;?"
"Come on, dude."
What?! Kyle?!
Dude!
"No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner."
Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
"Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil."
"No Santa, don't!"
The lion cubs!
I took them to see how abortions are done.
"Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!"
"Yeah. Yeah, there is."
"Oh, good."
"Dude, don't be nervous."
"You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure."
Good luck.
"Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do."
"Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball."
Wha-a-a negroplasty??
"Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?"
What?
"Jesus Christ, dude!"
"Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?"
"Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison."
What?! But you made him into a basketball player.
"Oh Jesus, he's about to play!"
"Kyle, NO!"
"Yeah, that's basically it."
"All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?"
Who are the corporations?
Are you serious? We never heard that.
Well... Well what do we do?
"Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind."
"Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read."
"Right, so how do we get back at them?"
NO!
Yeah!
So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
You mean like a baker and a cop?
"Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!"
"Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?"
"Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?"
"Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here."
"What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap?"
Dad!
Token sings?
Two hundred dollars.
"Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?"
Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.
Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
He's looking at the sign.
All right.
It's genius.
"Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man."
"You guys, we're gonna lose our client."
"Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can."
"This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie."
"Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!"
"Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?"
"You were awesome, Token!"
This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
"Uh excuse me, Token already has representation."
So unfair... so unfair.
Huh?
You were looking for a talent agent?
And what does she do?
"Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us."
Yeah!
"Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?"
"Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV."
"Uh sure, here she is.  Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family.  Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease?  Aw crap, Chinese Mafia!  Aaaaahh!"
There it is! American Idol contestants!
Ah our client has an audition to this show.
"Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am."
"No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing."
We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
"All right, our client will do it!"
"What's ""The Contender""?"
Go Wing!
Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
"Oh, thanks."
You do?
We won't!
"You guys, you guys!"
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
Yeah!
"Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing?"
"...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again."
Oh no!  Hey! That's our client!
"Two four nine all right, this is the place."
Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!
"You tell 'em, Kyle!"
"Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!"
"No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!"
We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way!
You bastards!
"Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!"
"Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of."
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
It's a lousy business. I quit.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.
"It's a game called ""Heaven versus Hell."" Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?"
"Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at."
Are we in trouble or something?
Oh wow...
Please what?
What?
Kenny?
"Dude, how'd you do that?"
"Yeah, the lawyer lost that page."
"Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure!"
Yeah!
"Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny."
Don't kill Kenny!
Don't kill Kenny!
"Well, what does it say?"
Oooo.
"You mean, Cartman's side is right?"
"Aw Jesus, not again."
Yes! It's over! It's over!
We can start having fun again!
We did it! We did it!
... What?
No... NOOO!!
"Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad."
"I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over."
I know we can lose if we try.
"Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know."
"Hundred bucks, no big whoop."
"Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order."
"Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!"
Damnit!
No!
Goddamnit...
Aw spit!
"Oh no. No, no, no!"
"Dad? Dad, we need to talk."
Goddamnit.
I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
Gay.
Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
"Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance."
"Wow, he IS great at sucking."
"Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our tean suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking."
This can't get any worse.
Disqualified?  Fight! Keep fighting!
"Come on, Dad! Get up!"
Dad!  You're the greatest.
"Dude, where is she? We can't wait."
Mom!
I want a breast!
"But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!"
All right.
"Okay, this is everything, mom."
"Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!"
I can't believe that fat asshole!
Well this time he's gone too far!
"Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?"
"Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!"
"All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him."
I think I have extra.
Here you go.
Cartman isn't our friend anymore.
Who was that?
"Dude, he did that to me this morning."
"Yeah, we know better than to think that."
Cartman?
"Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did."
"Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow."
He's what??
A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.
"Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show."
Woof.
"Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat."
"Man, I wish I could really drive this thing."
Sure I do!
"Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it."
"Okay, turn on the ignition,"
Okay...
"Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button!"
Jesus Christ!!!
Oh dude! Oh Jesus!
You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
What?
"Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers."
Huh oh.
"Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?"
"Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?"
"Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?"
You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
"Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!"
But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
Maybe they couldn't get out!
"Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here."
Nothing
"Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all."
"Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood."
"Kyle, it... it isn't global warming."
"Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood."
"Because, I know what did cause the flood."
No.
No.
No.
No.
...sort of.
"Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam."
"Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves."
"We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it."
"Uh, hey Dad."
"Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!"
"No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something."
"Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?"
We have to find a way out!
Come on! We've gotta get to the roof!
It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone!
"Guys, come on!"
"Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam."
No. I broke the dam.
No. I broke the dam.
I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.
No! I broke the fucking dam!
I literally broke the dam!
On a boat! That wasn't mine!
"I kept it secret, for two days!"
"The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!"
"Ohhh, fuck it!"
"Yeah, us too."
What?
"Oh my God, how does it know the answer?"
So what do you suggest?
"Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party."
"But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went."
"All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house."
"Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started."
Maybe they found him out.
"Come on, we gotta go check on him."
He's just dancing around.
"Come on, Butters."
Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
"Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now."
We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.
"We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are."
"Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny."
"Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy."
"So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up."
Kyle??
"So, what are you and Wendy doing?"
Uh huh...
"Yeah, well, so is your hat."
I can't. I'm busy.
...So take it with you!
"Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!"
HA!
"Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight."
Why do you say that?
That's because I was pissed off!
"You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you!"
Fine!
No problems at all!
"It's right there, see?"
Day five. I made it!  Hello?
What?
Governor's office?
"Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!"
"What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!"
You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!
"Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say ""See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is."""
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy."
"Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser."
I don't. She's totally lame.
"I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have."
Huh?
That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?
Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!
"Come on, buddy, let's go!"
"As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on!"
There! Over there!  Excuse us! Excuse us please!
Jesus Christ!
"Teacher, our egg is... okay."
"Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy."
"Dude, what's the big deal?"
What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes."
You buying school lunch today?
"That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger."
"Sure, for what?"
"Okay dude, knock him out.  Dude, dude okay, he's out!  Kyle, that's good!  All right, let's do it."
"You mean,you're a ginger?"
Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time.
Should we tell him the truth?
Huh? Why?
... totally.
"You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night."
You guys... need... anything?
"More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home."
The hell do they want?
"Run, dude, run!!"
"Kyle. Kyle, wake up."
I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
Cartman?
I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.
"No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free."
Well I can't spend any money.
Excuse me?
Uh what do I have to do?
Fine.
"L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something."
"Then how come that sign says ""Church of Scientology""?"
Seven and two.
"Uhhh, sh-sure?"
Yeah?
Yes.
So how did I do?
...Huh??
I am?? I didn't know that!
What what do I do?
I'm totally depressed.
I don't know.
I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.
"No, I found a self-help program that can cure me."
But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!
Neither did I!
"Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??"
...well but... but that's my money.
I hope so.
Really?
Thetan levels...
"So, this is gonna make me happy?"
What?
Stan.
I took out the garbage yesterday.
Aagh!  Stupid dumb garbage!
I don't know!
Jesus Christ...
"Aw dude, I need to go to bed."
"Yeah, I know who you are."
"Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess."
"I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay."
"Hey!  Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it."
"Dude, this is my room!"
Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!
Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out.
I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.
Sure.
"I, I guess."
But I don't know any of this stuff.
"Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet."
"Yeah, yeah!"
I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.
"Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact."
I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
"I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!"
"Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends!"
"I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers."
And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.
"And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong."
"I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help."
"... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?"
But you said that there were-
"But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?"
Three million dollars?
"Yeah. Yeah, I get you."
"Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon."
"And uh, oh,  ...I ...I can't do this."
"Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything."
I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.
What??
YOU told me it was a lie!
Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!
"Well go on, then! Sue me!"
"Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!"
"Okay, where to next?"
"Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show."
What?
I don't believe it.
Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
"All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards."
"Craig, Token, get the slings ready."
What happened?
They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.
"Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?"
Thanks.  Is this the Mexican space program?
Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?
This rocket will fly to the moon?
To the moon?
We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?
Two hundred? Million?
"Quick, call Kyle."
"They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?"
Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!
"Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water!"
"Okay, Manuel, hit it."
"Thanks for the ride, Manuel."
I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
Wait. Where's my Dad?
Yeah.
Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??
"Dad, weren't you watching?"
"Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?"
"Sure, whatever dude."
Why not just pull over?
"Dad, we're gonna crash!"
"Aww, it's all warm!"
This is sooo embarrassing.
"Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?"
"Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?"
Oh Jesus.
Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
"Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!"
What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!
"Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now!"
"Aww, Goddammit!"
"Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!"
No! You don't need another beer!
"Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple."
"Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here?"
"Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?"
"No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac"
"No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less."
"No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself."
"Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit!"
"Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?!"
"Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!"
What??
"Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!"
... I'm eight!
Where? I can't see.
Oh my God...
"Dad, let's just wait our turn."
"I just, my dad was-"
What?!
"No, Dad, people will see!"
"Dad, we're going back!"
Praise Christ.
"Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come."
"No, my dad doesn't drink."
"Dad, Dad, Stop!"
"Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue."
"Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own."
No!
"Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all."
"Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within."
I've had a great teacher.
"No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart."
All right!
That's probably okay if you spread it out.
I think you're pushing it.
That's not disciprine.
Dad!
