"I did too, Josh."
Not at all.
"O-hoh, yes Josh. Yehehessss!"
Ah!
Lisa Berger. 
But I'm the fat one.
Every cheerleading squad has a fat ugly cheerleader and that's me.
Shut up!
No way. I I'd just get made fun of.
"Uh, excuse me. Butters?"
"Um, well, I was just wondering if...  maybe...  you would like to go to a movie this weekend."
"Okay, thanks."
"What's your problem, Wendy?"
You're just a hater. Why don't you mind your own business instead of being jelly?
"Thanks, babe."
Lisa Berger! 
"Hey girls.  Don't be sad. If you wanna look really hot, like me, you just gotta be willing to sweat. Get down to the gym and work!"
"You wanna?
You, you, you wanna?
You wanna?
You wanna look pretty?
You want a boyfriend?
You want a nice ass?
You better work out, slut!
You want nice things?
You want boys to give you nice things?
You better work out, slut!
Now get to work, slut!
Party in the cookie trough!
Party in the cookie trough!
Party in the cookie trough!
You better work out, whore!"
Lisa Berger!
"Hey, come on, you guys. She just needs more confidence.  It's okay, Wendy. Who care if no one likes you? Maybe you should go out with Butters."
Our daddy is a very famous actor. What does your daddy do?
Why? What happened to all their money?
"Well, then, why don't their daddies just act in a movie?"
Indeed.
"So we must plead with him:  ""Please, Daddy, please! It's twenty million dollard, Daddy."""
"""I want a llama, Daddy!"""
"""Please, Daddy!"""
"""Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!"""
Twenty million dollars great.
"Oh no, we're going shopping."
How barbaric.
