Good-bye!
"Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people."
"Hey there, Richard!"
Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore.
Oho...  Thanks.
"You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks."
"Oh yes. You've got one too, I see."
Thanks.
"Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot."
"Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  ""Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"""
"Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!"
"NOW, KYLE!"
Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
"Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-"
"Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket."
"Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon."
"Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem."
"Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was ""high and mighty"" to  care about the earth!"
"Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the-"
"All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots!"
"Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away."
"Yes, it certainly is."
"Well, I totally agree, Kyle."
Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
"And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!"
"We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco!"
"I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs."
"I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car!"
"Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.  Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day,  we're just gonna have to be  with our own kind."
"Well? What do you think, huh?"
"Yeah. Now THIS, is a house."
Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.
Yeah. That's right.
"Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?"
Yeah. We sure are.
"Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some."
"Hey there. Alan, right?"
"Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?"
Oh. Sure.
"Everything okay in here, Kyle?"
"So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm."
Being smug is a good thing.
We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
"And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right?"
I don't think I can do it either.
"Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers!"
Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?
It's okay... it's dead.
"Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!"
"This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!"
He was just here! Ike!
Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler.
Like it.
"Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend."
That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
"If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try."
Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh.
"Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.   There! There's some change. All right, a little bit.  There you go. Take the change.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?"
"Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?  Change. Change?"
"Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change?"
"Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?"
Stop it! I really do need change!
Change?  Hello? Do you have any change?
What? You do?
Cha-a-ange?
Well Kyle?
Hey Randy.
"Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think."
"Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster!"
I doubt it.
Jesus...
It's... other-worldly.
Oh yes there is! You could do it again!
Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!
That's what we're here for.
"Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich."
They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
From Ireland.
Doing what?
"Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it."
What was the agreement?
But he has his mother's nose.
"It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy."
Killing our kids?
Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
"We have to protect our children from this, Sheila."
"Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as ""the cheese game"", or ""vitamin cheese"", or ""Mary Jane piss in your face fun time"". Cheesing is spreading fast."
I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.
"With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!"
"Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?"
"Kyle, have you been getting high?!"
Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!
How long have you been on the cheese?!
Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
"Now, Kyle!"
First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!
"I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it."
"No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this.  I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat.  But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting.  I... I'll just do it one more time.  One. Last. Time.  Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat.  And then I'll never do it again.  After this one... last... time..."
I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
Hey everybody. Good to see you again.
Huh... how come?
"What?  Get out of here, kid!"
You're too young for this stuff!
"She's mine, you little asshole!"
I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.
"And to the people of South Park.  I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain."
"And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real."
"Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you."
"Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-"
"The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald!"
Randy. What happened?
Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
"No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night."
But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there.
"Get out of the way, Peterson!"
How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
It could be nationwide.
No Internet... anywhere...
"Randy, where will you go?"
You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
"What is it, Kyle?"
Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!
All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
That's not ridicul-
Yyeeaahh!!!!
"What can we do, Randy?"
How did this happen?
Take it easy. We'll find him.
"It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses."
You have been very very naughty!  You're a naughty girl!
"What the?! ...Ike!  Ike, get back to bed right now!"
"Uh not this again.  Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!"
No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?!
"Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he he's just freaked himself out."
You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.
"Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read."
"Yeah, it's really amazing."
"Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!"
Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
But our homes and our lives are at stake.
Muff cabbage?
Here they come!
Kyle? What are you doing here?
"Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing."
"Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy."
"Hey, what the heck is going on?"
An agreement to do what?!
"No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC."
"Hey now, let him go!"
Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!
There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
Well that does it! I'm going to the police!
To find out where Apple is keeping my son!
My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!
Well what the heck does this w-!
"No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!"
You do??
What the hell are they doing now?!
"Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-"
Okay! Finally! How do we do that?
"Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!"
"Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple."
I agree.
I agree.
"We are all trying to create the future!  I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other.  Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?"
I wanna educate you kids with some real music.  This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music.
Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
"Okay, I'm done."
I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.
"Yeah, I'm a big boy."
I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.
What's going on down here?
Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?
How about I put on the uniform?
Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.
UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.
If you'll just...  sign right here.
"Yeah?  Do you like your package, ma'am?"
Huh?
And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
What?
What the hell's goin' on out here?!
"What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo!"
"Yes, that's mine."
Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!
"Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs."
Punching trees?
You are?
"There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley."
It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.
Yes?
That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.
"Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited."
"...Sorry, I don't think I get your-"
"From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something."
No. Does it really matter?
Are you guys parked over here?
A Handicar? What's that?
Wow...
Lucky.
"Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up."
"Stephen, what are you doing?"
"Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!"
God help them all.
Wow.
Oh no! Ohh!
"It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!"
"Sheila, let me handle this.  Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!"
"Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'"
Say it!
Again!
"Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed!  You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!"
What did you say?!
"Kyle, what are you doing in there?"
Open this door!
KYLE!
"Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!"
It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus!
Get him in the ribs!
Your mother's made gahekgafuga.
Meaning we're going to circumcise him.
"Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--"
"Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him?"
AAAGGGHH!!!
"Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go!"
"There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do."
"He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same."
"Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass."
"Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother."
"Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!"
Apologize to him!
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?  I mean, gravy.  Ow!"
"Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!"
"Please come home, Kyle. 
You left home lookin' for somethin' new. 
But all you need is right here waitin' for you"
"Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were."
"Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do."
"Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.  You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods."
"Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down."
"That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America."
"Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh..."
"Yeah, tackle box.  Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?"
Right. Right-right.
"Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.  Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?"
Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
"Oh, right."
"Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along."
"Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky."
Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today!  I wanted to be somebody!
"You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!  Ow!!"
Ow! You son of a bitch!
Ow!
Ow!
Huuuh!
That son of a bitch ripped my parka!
I just don't get it.  Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
What?!
"Oh, God, what have I done?"
Are you doing okay?
"And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me."
"Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down."
"I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski."
Uh-oh.
"Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O. J. off."
"And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.  We've got 'em."
Dammit..!
He’s using the Chewbacca defense.
Whoops.
"How was it, honey?"
"I'm sorry, honey."
What?!
"Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!"
Why?!
Huh?
Yes.
Why?
"Kyle, where's your mother?"
"Well, I have something to give to her!  Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom."
"We're rooting for the Broncos here, Jakov!"
Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
Sorry I'm late.
"Oh! Hi, Kyle."
"As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue."
"All right, we did it!"
"Hm.  You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh..."
"Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools.  Perhaps we should sue them next."
"Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings."
"Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?"
"Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?"
And you did nothing.
"Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?"
Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
You don't know?! You're the principal!
So it DOES go on!!!
"Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?"
"Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda."
"Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?"
And who's to blame?
There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!
Pan-Panda's mouth.
"All right! We did it, Eric!"
"That goes in the master bedroom.  Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?"
"Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big."
"Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million."
No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
"Sort of, yeah."
"Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you  close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!"
"So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me!"
"Wow, I'm good!"
Don't answer that!
Incriminate.
"Well? What do you think, Kyle?"
"Well, this one is bigger!"
"Kyle, let me explain something to you."
"You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace."
"No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?"
"Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it."
"Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated."
"Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments."
"No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!"
"Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!"
"Wow, neat!"
Yeah.
"Well, screw you guys!"
"Yeah, I know what you mean."
"Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar.  Only 'cause I've never smoked before."
What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
Yeah! ...Was that your leg?
Yeah.
She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
"Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be..."
You haven't?
"Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy."
"NO, no, uh I don't think so."
Sure is.
So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.
"Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?"
Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.
"Hey.  Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends."
"Hey, Randy. What are you doing?"
Can I come with you?
"Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you."
"So, so now we can't be friends?"
We said we'd never tell anybody?
"Oh, uh I didn't realize that."
"Well, uh uh a few people, yeah."
You didn't say not to tell anyone.
Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
"Hey, Randy, what's up?"
Huh?
Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
"You're having regrets, aren't you?"
Hey. Talk to me.
I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
"Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do."
Having a good time?
"I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-"
Honey?
Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
I just want to know it meant something to you.
So we're friends again?
"I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!"
"You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout."
"Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?"
"Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout."
"Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle."
"Yeah, lie."
"Hey, it's a bear!"
"Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back."
"We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys."
"Yeah, I guess so."
"Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something."
"You see, son, fads come and go. And this ""Chin-po-ko-mon"" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, ""I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual."" Do you understand?"
Hm... Good point; here's $10.
"Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too."
"Oh God, is there nothing we can do?"
"I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play."
You bet money on my son to win?!
"Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff."
Yeah. See ya.
The flagpole! That's great!
He can't do that!
"Uh, what are they doing?"
You're dreaming!
"This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!"
More schnapps!
Where am I?
Me neither.
"What's ""grab ass?"""
"Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back."
"Hello, everybody. Say, can I join in?"
"Courtney Cox,"
I love you.
You're so hot
on that show.
"Courtney Cox,"
I love you.
You're so hot
on that show.
"Courtney Cox, I love you.  
You're so hot  on that show."
"Courtney Cox,"
I- huh?
"...Oh, sorry."
"Courtney Cox,"
I love you.
You're so hot
on that show.
"Courtney Cox,"
I love you.
You're so hot
on that show.
One question?
"Oh, hello, son."
"What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk."
"No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan."
Kyle...
"Well, they were probably real."
Probably not.
"Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children."
It sure did.
It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
Oh my God!
"Hey, boys, how's the research coming?"
"Oh, uuhh. I don't know."
"Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets."
"Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day."
"Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?"
"Hello, boys."
"Oh yeah, I got a great angle here."
Good idea.
That's what being young is all about.
"The answer is no, Kyle!"
A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
"Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it."
"Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-"
Because we're your parents!
"Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?"
"Eh, neither did we."
"Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!"
I don't have any urges!
"Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now."
"Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it."
Uh huh.
"Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you."
"Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--"
"Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?"
"Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay.  You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago.  Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends."
"He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God."
"But Satan said, ""Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."""
"And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers."
"And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all."
"So then, Job got painful sores all over his body."
"God said to Satan, ""See? I told you. Job still praises me."""
"Oh. Uhhh, I don't know."
"Isn't he responding at all, doctor?"
"But, what if you're not ready at 17?"
"Hey! W-what are you saying? What ""types""?"
They're scared to death!
"They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!"
"...He might, Kyle."
"Oh we're so sorry, Jared"
"A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that."
"I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo."
Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.
Aha.
"Wow, filet mignon' and lobster!"
"Yeah. Can we go now, please?"
"Finally, we get to go skiing!"
"Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy."
"Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody."
How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!
Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!
"My God, can you believe those people?!"
"The police work for time-share, too?"
"Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours!"
"Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer."
"Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV."
You know your brother watches MacNeil-Lehrer Report every night at ten!
It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil-Lehrer
"Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers!"
We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.
"Yeah. Come along, Kyle"
"Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now."
"Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven."
But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.
"Kyle, that's not the issue right now."
Kids!
"All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?"
"I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made."
"I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People."
"Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago."
It was Backdoor Sluts 9.
"Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?"
"Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context."
Stinger?
"Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice."
"Okay, boys. Do you have any questions?"
I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.
So full of metaphor.
"Yeah, dirty lungs!"
That's what our boys were talking about?
We'ge gotta get our boys back!
Kyle!
"That brave, brave man."
"Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?"
There was no war months ago!
"Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!"
Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!
"Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!"
"And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China."
"All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club?"
Oh yeah! blackjack table!
"Relax, sweetie  I know how to count cards."
"All right, time to show these people how to gamble!"
"Ohh, not so good."
Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand.
"I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem."
Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!
The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.
That's it. I'm destitute.  Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup!  Wha- what's in the cup?
Oh God. Oh Jesus.
"Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!"
"How am I going to tell my family?  How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house?"
"Oh, Jesus."
"What, What did you say?"
"Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave!"
"No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!"
"Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling the moving company right now!"
"Yeah! But wait.  Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million!"
Let it ride!!
Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted.
HAAAAAA!!!  Kyle! What's happened to you??
"Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!!"
"Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys."
"Oh, is the game on or something?"
Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too??
What's that?
Here I come!
Kyle! You look terrible!
"Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look."
"Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!"
Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
"Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already."
It wasn't your life yesterday.
"The answer is no, Kyle."
"Kyle, what did you do?!"
"Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused."
We've gotta get out of here!
"They, they're... they're playing street hockey!"
"Randy, what is this?"
Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you?
"We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.  I'll get it."
Yes?
"Yes, I can tell."
I I'm not sure.
What?
"Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind."
"Look, Ike is our son now!"
"Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!"
Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!
There's nothing I can do.
"Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you."
"Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have."
This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!  The worst thing!
"Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!"
"So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?"
"Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today."
"Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?"
Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy!
Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?
"Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here."
"We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it."
"How did you do it, Kyle?"
Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street!
"What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older."
Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God!
That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL!
He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!
"Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!"
"Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!"
"Oh, that does it!"
That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off!
Who the hell do you think you are?!
What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!
"Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!"
"What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins! Why?"
"A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-"
...What?
Make me a... dolphin?
"...No.  No, no, it's crazy."
"That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.  Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin!"
"Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself?"
"I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt...  here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding!"
"Come on, Kyle, we should get going!"
"Alright Kyle!  Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?"
"Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?"
Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.
"Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!"
What? Why??
Oh my God!
"Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle!"
Stop the game!
"So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?"
We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.
"Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!"
"Boy, that was great, wasn't it?!"
How much was bail this time?
"Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious."
Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.
"Shh, shh! We've got the television working!"
And... the rest of the country?
Randy! We've looked everywhere! Kyle's missing too!
I'm going with you.
You can't do this alone!
"Stephen!  Stephen, you have to keep moving!"
Oh Jesus...  I feel warm too!
"Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!"
