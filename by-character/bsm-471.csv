"I have come to destroy that Trapper Keeper, because it was the Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper that belongs to an Eric Cartman in South Park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being, and destroys all of humanity. In the year 2004, a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer. From there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world.  It became stronger and stronger, until by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind  and there was nothing the humans could do.  It wasn't long before Mighty Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless, including humans.  The nations tried everything to stop it.  Nuclear devices, seismic missiles. But nothing worked.  The humans built robots of their own, whole armies of them.  But nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper Keeper.  And so finally, the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the Trapper Keeper before it even got started."
"And so, Eric. Now you see why we must destroy your Trapper Keeper."
"Good morning, humans."
"I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada."
"Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right."
Oh no!
We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper.
"Well, that does it!"
"I'm afraid I have no other choice.  For the sake of humanity, I have to kill him."
What?
"Oh, well, I suppose."
"Wait!  Perhaps there is another way. If you could take me to where Eric Cartman lives, I could try reasoning with his human mother."
"I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually starting to feel what you humons call ""compassion"". It is an amazing feeling!"
"And so you see, Ms. Cartman, you cannot buy your son Eric another Trapper Keeper. Not now! Not ever!"
Correct.
Good. Now all that is left to do is destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has now. Where is he?
Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain!
It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers!
A part of your friend must still be alive in there.
"That must be what Trapper Keeper is using for ventilation. If one of you could get in there, you could reach the CPU."
It is infusing with everything. It is already too powerful to stop!
Look! I think that infusing with Rosie O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick.
Look! I'm fading!  It must have worked. I don't exist!
