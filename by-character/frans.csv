"What's the matter, Ohrlich? Lose your sense of trust?"
Very well.
"I'm going to ask you again, what is the door code to the tunnel?!"
"You are an employee here, that means you are required to know the door code for fire code reasons,  Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs!"
That's it!  Tell me the code or you die!  One... two...
Yes?
Give us the code to that door and we can leave!
"I don't have time for your stupid game! Tell me, or you die right now!"
God damn it you people are fucking insane!
"Domino,  Walsky! Find out if there are any employees or students wandering about! Bring them here or shoot them!"
"Frohlich, check in. Have you found any other employees?"
Stop it! Stop your bad historical acting right now!
I am the fucking bad man! Do you get that?! Knock it off and give me the mine shaft access code!
I won't kill you if you don't tell me. I'll kill one of THEM!
Do you want to see a child die?!
What about you? Will you tell us the access code or do you want to see this kid die?!
God damn it!
"All right, that does it!  On the count of three this child dies! One! Two!"
Wha-what are you doing?
"Eighteen sixty four. Ohrlich, we have the door code! Start packing up! We'll take the hostages with us!"
Go! Go take care of it! I'll stay with the hostages!
They are coming in!
You're hurting my arm!
"In a way, it was. I might not have gotten away, but... at least I learned a lot about Pioneer life in the Old West. Those early settlers didn't have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today. To think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin' as simple as washing your clothes. Pioneer Village has a lot to teach us all."
