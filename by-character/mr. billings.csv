"There's two things that separate Sooper Foods from all the other grocery stores: Fun and safety. What do you think, Peters? What are the chances that this 'Jewpacabra' is real?"
We can't afford to take that chance. Get this kid whatever he needs.
So where are we heading first?
The Bahamas?
Where to now?
All the kids will be so disappointed.
"Alright, grab him."
"Look, we're sorry. But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice."
Just a little blood to try and draw it out. We just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. Our entire business is based on fun and safety.
"Maybe it won't even show up. Maybe we'll all make it out of this okay?  Oh fuck, we better get out of here."
"Hello young man. Let me start off by saying Sooper Foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company.  But... if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on Easter children, we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat. Thank you."
"There are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping: Fun and Safety. On this beautiful Easter morning, we are thrilled to give back to he people of South Park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number...  4 in fun and number 6 in safety. Let the hunt begin."
