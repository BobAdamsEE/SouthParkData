"Come on, Squirt! We're meeting over here!"
"I'm the Squirt leader. I don't want to be the Squirt leader, but I don't have a choice; it's the only way I can earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend all night instructing Squirts."
Come on!
"Okay, Squirts, the elders have given us a very important task tonight. We are all going to make macaroni pictures, like this one,  using dry macaroni, paper, and glue."
"Because that's what Squirts do! Now, shut your pie-hole!"

"We are Squirts, we are Squirts; we're so kosher that it hurtsWhen we get older we'll be Scouts, but until then we are Squirts There he is, Squirts.  Okay, Squirts. Remember the plan: immobilize and attack. Matthew, y-you immobilize the bear with the net, then Echo team, run up and attack it with your Squirt knives.  Don't get too close now, just close enough to throw the net on the stupid bear.  Now!"
"Oh, no!  Oh, God!  Oh, the bear took a Squirt. Oh, I'm gonna get it now!"
"Now, we'll just see how Mr. Bear likes rat poison.  Well now, that'll be enough to kill a stupid bear. Okay, raise the tray!  Chutzpah badge, here I come.  Yikes!  Okay, here he comes. Easy now. Easy, Squirts.  Okay, Squirt, lower the tray.  That's it. That's it, you god-damned stupid bearface!"

We'll flush him out and we'll attack him!"
"Remember, this is only a bear. All we have to do is stick together, and we can spend the rest of the night making bear sandwiches!  Where's Zigmal?"
"God-damnit! You stupid god-damned son of a bear, you've taken your last Squirt! Do you hear me?!"
