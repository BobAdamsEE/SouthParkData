That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?
Everything is going to be awesome now!
"Amazing book, Butters."
"Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete."
What can we do? We're all gonna get fired!
"Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them."
Our students committing suicide?
How do we do that?
"Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked."
"Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am."
"This way, ma'am"
Bras?
They can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off!
"Awww, do we need Mackey here?"
He doesn't look any different to me.
"Wrong! You are here because you are America's future!  You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have...  shop class."
"Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a-  I have... uh, I have a..."
"Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?"
"That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?"
"Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we-  Hey! Did you just flip me off?!"
"Yes, you did!"
Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!
Aaaarr! Uh.  Oh why? Why?
Huhuh Huh? Stop screwing around!
"Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed."
"Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later."
Why?
"Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on."
"I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts."
Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time.
"Haaarrr!  Aw, God, what am I gonna do?"
"Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing!"
"Huh? Uh, what?"
"The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I?  Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide."
"Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago."
What? Hey! Go on!  You're screwing around in here!
No. No. Make it stop.
Baaaaa!  I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye!  Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?!
"Good-bye, cruel world.  Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell!"
"What? Who are you?  ""Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class."" Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there.  Hrh."
What the-?
Hey! What's going on?
"Well, why the hell don't you stop them?"
Don't screw aROUND!
Stop screwin' aROUND!!
"Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!!"
"Well, don't just stand there, call an ambulance!  You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class?"
"What? What's that, son?"
"AAaaagh!  No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you."
But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.
Good-bye?
No.
You... you're right. You're right.
"Gram'ma? Hi, Gram!"
"Uncle Corey! Wow, you're all alive again!"
"Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive.  Thank you, baby. Thank you."
I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.
