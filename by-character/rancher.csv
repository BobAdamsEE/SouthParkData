"Now let me get this straight: You want four horses, one for each of ya?"
Well I think we can set ya up.
"Step right out here, we'll get you going.  Got four more for you, Duncan."
"Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens."
"Naw, I didn't see anything. It just happened so fast."
What does it say?
"Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say ""Nothin' to see here"", and ""Case closed."" But we want justice. We have to find this sicko!"
For what? Orderly conduct?
I'm not fishin'.
"Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got."
"Well, have fun, boys."
"Oh, I got a barn it can stay in. It ain't much, but it's heated."
"Well, the way I see it, if he really is who he says he is, well then he'd better do somethin' on New Year's Eve, 'cause it's in the Bible!"
What kind of turkey are you lookin' for?
"Well, I ain't got a whole lot left, it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all.  Go ahead, just pick one out."
"Oh, that one's a little messed up. Not exactly the... pick of the litter."
Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head.
Fifty bucks.
I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot.
"I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too."
"Hello, boys and girls. My name is Rancher Bob."
Oh yeah. There he is. That's Jeffy.
"Well, that's 'cause it needs music. Here y-here ya go, Jeffy. You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honeeey.You'll do a line and I'll do a line, babe.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, we'll fight an' screw 'til the mornin' time.
Honey, babe, be mine.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honey-"
"No no, he'll dance to anything. See?
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, honeeey.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, babe.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, we'll fight an' screw all night and day.
Honey, babe, be mine."
