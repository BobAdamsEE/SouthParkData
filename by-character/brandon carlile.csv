Lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady. It would be a shame if someone was... having fun at her expense.

"Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I understand you work at the U.S. Geological Survey?"
"I also understand that you're the uncle of the amazing and talented songwriter, Lorde?"
Work with her? How?
How's that?
The what?
