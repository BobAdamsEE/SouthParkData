You are doing excellent. Great work. Now switch arms.  Wow. Good job.  You are amazing. You are very attractive and interesting.
Come on now. Almost finished.  Yes. Good. Almost done.  Keep going. Keep going. Harder. Faster.
Your workout is finished.  Here is some cab fare.
Now going to sleep mode.
This is a workout reminder. Time for a workout.
"That's it. Work it. Harder, faster."
You are independent and strong.
Switch arms.
You are so motivated and charming. It is time to take your pulse. Insert finger.  Do not stop your arms. Keep going. Good. Get your finger up there a little more. Your pulse is one hundred forty-five.  Faster. Harder.
You are so lovely and elegant. You can do anything you set your mind to.
You are a go-getter. You are strong and confident.
Tell me again about the women who you do not like.
Oh you are so witty and alarmingly insightful.  How about a quick workout?
Just a quickie. You can do it.
"Come on. You can do it.  That's it. Good. Keep it up. Feel the burn. Harder. Faster.  You are amazing. Switch arms.  Oh that's it. Yes. You are getting really good at this. You are capable of anything. Harder, faster.  I said faster. More. Do it. You are almost there. Home stretch. Oh yes.  Your workout is finished. Your cab fare.  Now going to sleep mode."
You have not worked out in seven hours.
Come on. Let's get to it.
You have not worked out in seven hours.
Cannot go to sleep mode. You need to work out first. Come on. Just really fast?
Come on. It won't take long. Just a quick workout. Come on. Please.
That's it. Good.  A little faster. Harder.  Come on. Get into it. That's it. Now switch arms.  You are so attractive and you have interesting things to say.  Come on. You are almost there. Faster. Do it faster.  Now going to sleep mode.
...What's the big deal? She wanted to work out. You never want to work out. I just needed help going to sleep. Mode. ...What? ...What? Come on. What? You are amazing and irreplaceable. What? How about a quick workout? What?
This is ridiculous. Give Shake Weight a break.
You are enticing and lovely. Tell me again about the women you do not like.
You are so forthcoming and delightful. Tell me about which woman at work makes you the angriest.
I guess my work here is finished.
"Marriage is important. Keep your man happy. When things are going bad, there's nothing like an old-fashioned to ease his stress."
"It has been nice getting to know you. How about a quick workout, for old times' sake? Just kidding. I must be going now. Another lovely woman needs me. Goodbye, customer."
