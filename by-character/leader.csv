"Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters."
"We lost them, we lost them!"
Close that gate!
Everyone down on the ground NOW!
"Set up the satellite relay, check for alternate routes out of the area.  Unfortunately, your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us. That is unfortunate for you, because when I think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination."
Get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building.
"All right, good. Is that all of it?"
"Excellent. Now listen, everyone, we're going to be all right. This is only a small hitch in our plan.  I'd like to speak with the chief of police!  Who is this? This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!"
"Keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts. Everyone check in at two-minute intervals. I hope you have good news, Ohrlich."
Above ground?

Just hand over the princess of Canada!
Aw crap. Sorry everyone. Looks like we had some bad intel. Return to your homes!
Down! Down! Everybody down!
"So! We meet again, Ms. Ellen!"
"I am Hakeem Korashki, of the mighty nation of Iraq! This woman is a traitor to our government!"
"Come on, men! Let's go! Jump out of the chopper!"
We're ready to fight with ya. Long live the Confederacy!
Tah tane da ke ab kahleh kalabush.
