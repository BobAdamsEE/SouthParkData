"Mmaarr. I don't know-uh, I might need some more convincing, hm-hm-hm."
"Naw, not another committee. Send them in.  This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee?"
"Well, boys, what can I do for you?"
Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.
"Oh jeez, I knew this would happen. First the gay people come in here wanting equal rights, then this bill gets passed and now all the people against it want me to veto it. &gt; Why do I have to make this decision?? -&gt;"
"I just wanted a big house and lots of respect. I didn't want this kind of responsibility.  I mean, I don't know anything about gay marriage. What argument can I use to deny them their right to a family?"
I can't use that argument. There's never been a study done which proves that either way.
Then I would have something to fall back on. So-something to take all the pressure off of me.
"I believe that I might have come up with a compromise to this whole problem that will make everyone happy! People in the gay community want the same rights as married couples, but dissenters don't want the word ""marriage"" corrupted. So how about we let gay people get married, but call it something else?  You homosexuals will have all exactly the same rights as married couples, but instead of referring to you as ""married,"" you can be... butt buddies.  Instead of being ""man and wife,"" you'll be... butt buddies. You won't be ""betrothed,"" you'll be... butt buddies. Get it? Instead of a ""bride and groom,"" you'd be... butt buddies."
"Y-you are equal. It's just that instead of getting ""engaged,"" you would be... butt buuuddies. And everyone is happy!"
"Well like anyone cares about fuckin' dykes.  Oh, God, I was sure that would work."
"Today is a very big day in which I'm supposed to make a very big decision. As some of you know, my biggest issue with gay marriage regards child-rearing. And a new study has just been concluded which will give me the ability to take no personal responsibility in this decision."
Here with the results of that study is the lovely Mrs. Garrison.
This egg is fine.  Gays can get married!
