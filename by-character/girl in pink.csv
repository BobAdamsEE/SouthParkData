"We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!"
"These are the school's sleds, ass rammers, not yours!"
"I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!"
"How about a race down a real hill, then?!"
Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!
Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
"See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!"
"Don't forget: we still have a sledding race this Saturday, pillow biters."
"Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!"
"See you Saturday, poo sniffers!"
"Woohoo. Great time, girls.  Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers!"
"Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!"
"Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!"
"Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!"
This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!
"We've got' em, girls!"
G'aaaaah!
