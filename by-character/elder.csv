And here's a cloud.  You can all pick up your bars of soap later on, as we will all be making soap sculptures tonight.  Now, this year we are pleased to announce that Jewbilee has grown to over one hundred Jew Scouts from all around the country. All new inductees, raise your hands."
"Uhhhh, yess, and what is your name, young man?"
"O-oh, wonderful, uh, uh, um...  Cu-could you run out and grab some... some of those candles for us?  There we go. Ahem.  Now, I would like all the new inductees to step forward, please."
Raise your left hand and repeat after me: I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
"My honor, wide and true."
I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
"Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew."

"Release Moses, now!"
"Haman will be summoned and we will be forced to obey him, or die."
"Yeah, obeying should work out swell."
