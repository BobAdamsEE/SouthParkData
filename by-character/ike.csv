Do I look like I wanna do fuckin' fingerpaints?!  Look at the fuckin' zits on my face!
"Then stop harassing me, bro! You don't know what it's like to be a baby goin' through puberty! I don't know whether to watch Yo Gabba Gabba or go out and tame some strange!"
Dancy Dance is my favorite.
Who would you rather fuck?  Foofa or Toodee?
"I wanna fuck Foofa.  I wouldn't wanna fuck Toodee. She's a dike. You can tell. But Foofa, man.  I bet she's got some sweet strange.  I don't even know what the fuck Muno is."
What?! You gonna fuckin' narc and tell Mom?!
That's 'cause you don't understand shit!  I knew this was a bad idea!  I'm gonna watch Yo Gabba Gabba in my roomsy!
"This is stupid, bro! I already know all this!"
"You're fucking stupid, Kyle! "

"I can tame Foofa's strange, bro."
"This is stupid, bro.  Foofa shouldn't be limiting herself to little kids. She's fuckin' fine, dude. "
Foofa's got that nice shaved strange that you just wanna get in and tame the second you see it.
Told you it'd go over well.
"Shut up, Kyle! Just ignore my little brother."
"Answer the door, twerp! "
"You just don't get it 'cause you're a robot, Plex."
"Awww, screw off, Sinéad O'Connor. No one gives a crap about you."
"Get out of here, dude!"
"No, you don't understand, wuss! Why can't you just let me grow up?! Why do you keep harassing me?!"
"He's right, Foofa. Part of growing up is rebelling, but I'm gonna get older whether I like it or not. So why push it? I think I'm just gonna let it happen naturally. "
Kyle! It's Dora the Explorer!
