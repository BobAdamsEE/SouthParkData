Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.
Very well. Take this document to the Continental Congress.
Some favir going to war with England and others want to avoid war at all cost.
"Perhaps this document will make the reasons for war obvious to all. Good luck, young messenger!  Now make haste!"
"Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time."
