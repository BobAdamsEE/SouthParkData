"Okay, let's eat!"
"Ooo, that sounds emotional!  What is it son? What's on your mind? Whatever it is, you know your dad has the time."
"If you can talk it, you can sing it.  You can lay down the rhythm and bring it! Just put a melody to the words that you're sayin' and sing the beat-"
What did you say?
Basketball? No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!
There's no singing and dancing in basketball!
"Don't you even think about it! If I had a jock for a son, I'd be the laughingstock of the men's choir club."
Don't make me slap you!  I will slap your face so super hard...  I am the man of this house! You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!
"What did you say, woman?!"

I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there! You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!
"Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole!"
"You know what this means? It means you're about to get slapped, so you'd better shut up!"
I'll do it! I'll slap the shit out of you!
You don't tell me how to raise my son! I'll slap it again.
"You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself  There, there's another slap! Maybe you'll think next time you act, you-  Slap it, I'll slap it!"
"Shut up, Bridon!"
"Get out of my way, Mackey. You wanna piece of this?!  I'll slap everyone in this God damned school if I have to!"
"You are never going to play shooting hoops, do you understand?!  You are going to sing and dance and be the best at it!"
Stupid-ass boy!

"You'd better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car, 'cause there's a world o'hurt about to come your way!"
"Oh, by all means. You got the balls to come in here?! Do it! Do it!"
"Yeah! There it is! Slapped you! You probably think I'm finished, huh?!  No, there's another one!"
"Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you!  There's a slap for you!  Slap, slap, slap!  Yeah, there you go!  Here's a little reach around the back of the head slap!"
"Awww. I'm going slap-happy!  I'm going slap, slap happy! Slappity slappin' you, teachin' you a lesson for coming in my house!  What are you looking at, Robertson?"
"You hear the rhythm. Now is the time, the tiiiiime. It's time to go to bed. It's time to call it a day. You can reach the stars and-"

"What?!  What's going on here, what's this all about?  What do you think you're doing?"

"Kids these days!  Unh unh unh! Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!"
"Go ahead. Make my day.  You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red hand prints all over face!  Ow!  Oh my God, what was that?  Did you see that?! Oh my God it hurts so bad!  Ow. What the ""H"" is going on?!"
