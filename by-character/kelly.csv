You mean me or the little one?
"Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay."
"Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.  You okay?"
Travis? Everything okay?
Hope?
"What it, it's just rain."
"My God, Travis, they're all dying!"
Travis!
I can't... hang on!
Nooooooooooo!
Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you.
Lenny?
Johnny?
Oh.
Your family isn't poor?
"Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?"
"Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?"
"Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny?"
Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?
That's good. Can I tell you something?
I think I like you.
"Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well."
"No, that's not good."
"No. See, if I start to like you too much,  I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country.  Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again.  And that would devastate me.  So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny!"
"Benny, will you hold my hand?  I don't want to get emotionally attached, though."
We are?
"Me, too!"
I wanna go home!  I hate the rainforest!
"Oh Lenny, hold me.  No, I can't get attached.  Oh, but I do like you."
"Oh, but you're only going to leave me."
Aaaaa! Lenny!
"Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care!"
"Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!"
"Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day."
Aaaah! Lenny! No!
Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?!
"Who's ""they""?!"
"Well don't just stand there, help him!!"
"Aaagh!  Come on, Benny! Breathe!  Breathe, you son of a bitch!"
Then why did you do it??
"Great! I want you to meet my new friend, Stan."
Brian's gonna give you your personality test and then let you know some things about Scientology.
"Michelle, our friend Stan wants to have auditing."
"It's the beginning of a whole new life for you, Stan. See ya afterwards."
"Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park."
