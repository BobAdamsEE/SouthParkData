"Have a seat, Henrietta. "
"Henrietta, as you know, your mother and I have been concerned about your behavior for some time."
"We've had a hard time coping with the dark things you're into, but we've finally had some counseling, and apparently we're not the only parents who have a child that is... emo."
Do you know how your foul language breaks your mother's heart?
"So listen, sweetie, we've found a camp. "
"A camp which is for troubled kids like you, and you get to work outside and learn about responsibility."
"It's for two weeks, and when you come back we can talk about earning back some of your privileges."
Does she still seem better?
Well that's more like it.
