"Henrietta, your little brother wants to play with you."
"Just let your little brother play with your friends, sweetie. He's lonely. Go on in, Bradley."
"Henrietta, sweetie."
"Oh, but remember, Daddy wanted to talk to you in the living room, my dark little princess."
We'll be waiting in the living room.
Oh goodness I am so nervous. 
"Oh, a little family chit-chaaat."
"But Daddy and I love our little muffin, even if she's emo or not."
Like calling Mommy Demon Jizz.
Theeeey have a horseshoe pit where you can challenge the other kids to horsehoooes.
"Henrietta, I baked cookies for your new little Emo friends."
"Oh, much better! She didn't call me a bitch, and she actually apologized to me."
"Henrietta, I have dinner ready."
...Fatty.
