Fellow Pilgrims! The great Captain hath gone missing and thine enemies have attacked our stuffing mines! We must prepare for war with the Indians!
"You dare come to Plymouth, ambassador?! After attacking our stuffing mines?!"
"Wihtout control of the mines we cannot supply stuffing to the mortals, ambassador! This will be war!"
And how knoweth you that?!
"I do not give free bowls of stuffing, what sayest you?! We will take back control of the stuffing mines!"
"And I pray to stuffing that you are wrong.  Where are you, Miles Standish?"
Then our last chance for survival is gone?
And so soon the Indians will be here. Sound the corn horn! We must abandon Plymouth!
