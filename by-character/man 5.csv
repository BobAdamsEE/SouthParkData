All right Oprah!
Make that three.
What is that?
Tell us what to do.
Have you ever seen Faith Hilling so good?
"God must be very angry with us. But why?  How have we angered you, Lord?"
Me too.
"Wait, it's not a gun. It's a piece of paper."
"Yeah, you're Jesus."
You're the one in control.
"Come in. Come here, guys."
"Well, I guess the flag is part of history, â€¦but I can see how it is racist."
"Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven?"
Yeah!
"My God, they're right!"
No shit!
"Just let 'em have it out, Susan. They'll run out of steam soon."
What's goin' on?
"Jesus Christ, who will save us?"
"Three eyewitnesses testified that if Hat hadn't killed those babies, they'd have killed him!"
But here in the mountain there's no freedom like that.
So courageous.
"Yeah, help me out too, 'k?"
"So long, coppers!  Oh, shit!"
Oh my God!
This is bullcrap!
"Ms. Claridge, the people in town are really worried about you."
"All right, fine! But someday you're gonna have to learn to let people in!  Bitch."
We didn't listen!
Yeah.
Yeah. I was diagnosed with brain cancer two months ago. I feel like this is my only hope.
