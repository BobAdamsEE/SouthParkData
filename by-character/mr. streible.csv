"Honey, what is it?? Oh, Jesus no! Our house!"
Whyyy? Whyyy?
"There we go. That should be about the last of it.  Ex- excuse me, uh, wha-what are you doing?"
"Ah... look, we really don't wanna make a big deal out of this."
"Lo-ih ih it's just not that big a deal, I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself when I was a kid."
I was here.
"Officer, why would I TP my own house?"
"It wasn't me, okay? Now, if you don't mind, I just wanna get my yard back to normal."
"You really have nothing better to do, do you?"
"Oh, Jesus no! Our house!"
