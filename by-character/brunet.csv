Mrs. Broflovski?
We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you?
Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave.
Well. The- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.
"Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak."
Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.
"Yes. And, now for the difficult part."
"It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like â€” an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-"
...Do?
"Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something."
"Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition."
"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like."
"Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like."
"Alright, KoRn, time for you to get out of town!"
Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody?
They say you can either fight them or join them.
