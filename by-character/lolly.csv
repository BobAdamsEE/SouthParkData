"Oh, hello there, kids! Welcome to Lolly's Candy Shop."
Oh that's great!
Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket stub.
You know. When you entered the contest you got the other half of this ticket.
Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you high?? How else do I know you're the winners?
"Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy shopping spree. If you find it, you can come back, but you only have one week to claim the prize. That's called ""The Ticking Clock."" Works great in the movies."
All right. There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. You'll need it to claim your prize.  Sign up for the five-minute shopping spree!!
Alright! There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub.
