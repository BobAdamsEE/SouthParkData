I'm baaack!
"Hello, cousin Kyle. Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible. They served a chicken dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas."
"Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am. I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though. Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses."
Where do I stand?
"Don't throw the ball too fast, because I might get startled and I have asthma."
"Jesus, not so close! That was three feet from hitting me in the head!"
Oh Jesus!
Don't throw it so hard or so close next time! Is it cold out here? I think I need a jacket.
Oh Jesus!
"I can't, I can't keep running like this! I have corns in my feet!"
"Oh Jesus, did you see that? I hit a homerun! High-five, everybody!"
"Oh Jesus, we're gonna win! I I never won a sport before; this is so exciting."
We... We lost.
