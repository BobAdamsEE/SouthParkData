"Thank you, thank you, wow, what a great audience.  I just flew into South Park.  Used to be I didn't need an airplane."
"As most of you know,  I am a strong supporter of stem-cell research."
"Though it is controversial,  stem cell research is critical  in the quest for helping  the disabled."
In the coming days  I will prove to the world  that stem-cell research is a miracle.
"Thanks for having me on again, Larry."
"Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated  about stem-cell research. See, the stem cells from a fetus like this one  can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet."
"Well, it's very simple.  And now you can see, my arms have better movement."
"Thank you everyone.  To most people, this is just an ordinary fetus. But to people like me,  it's hope."
Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again.
"Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you?"
I am better with each passing day.  Stronger and more agile.
What?
"And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?"
"Stop calling me Christopher! That name no longer has meaning to me! Christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair! Always being pushed around by others! The old Christopher Reeve is dead! From now on, I am...  Chris!"
"Hello, Gene! So good to see you!"
Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?!
"Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!!  You won't stop me, Hack Man!  Ha HA! Ha HA! Ha haa haa!  Ya ha ha! Yaa haha!"
"I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery,  Their desire for world conquest,  and their hatred of all things good!  And I've assembled this group for one purpose! To once and for all find a way to...  get rid of Hack Man!!"
Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission.
Hack Man!
No...  NOOOO!
"You haven't seen the last of me, Hack Man! I will be back!!"
