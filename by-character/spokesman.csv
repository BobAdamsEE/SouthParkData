"Alright folks, we wanna thank you all for comin' out an' supporting NASCAR."
How who's ready for Saturday's big race?
We're really excited to be part of the fastest-growing sport in America!
"I don't know about you, but I'm thrilled to watch NASCAR finally becoming recognized as a respected, legitimate sport."
"Protecting your home and your family is hard enough! But sometimes alarms on your doors and windows aren't enough! A new security system allows not only for your doors and windows to be monitored, but your fear levels as well.  A security system that is actually inside you. It's called IN-security."
Don't let your family become another statistic. Have piece of mind with...  INsecurity.
