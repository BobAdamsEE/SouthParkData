It isn't fair. All my hard work.  I'm not going to take it anymore.  That wrestling show is in for a big surprise.  I'm putting an end to this once and for all!  Hyaaaaa!
"Stay calm, you know what you have to do."
For the good of real wrassling.
Oh don't mind me.  I was just about to-
"Only one shot.  Maximum damage.  This is all your fault, you WWE president asshole! Your fault we all die here. Right. Now. FOR WRASSLING!  NO!"
"No! No, shut up!  You idiots want wrassling?! This is wrassling!"
This is just a bunch of garbage! And you are all ruining the good name of wrassling!  Wrassling is from ancient Greece! It's in the Olympics!
Why do I care? These kids made it so real wrassling is gone from schools! It's practically gone from the culture. Damn it they took my job!
"You want to know pain? Pain is dedicating your entire life to a sport, to a career, and then having it all ripped away from you like a babe from its mother."
Lost everything! Couldn't even afford to pay for my... little retriever Rex anymore! Animal Control came and got him!
"I ended up on the streets, stealing! Got busted by the police and had to spent the night in jail! The other inmates, they all beat me and fractured my jaw to where I couldn't eat!"
So you see I have nothing left. Nothing! Not even the will to live.
What?
"You, you mean it?"
