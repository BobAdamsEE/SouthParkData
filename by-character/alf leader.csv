"That's right. We are members of the Animal Liberation Front! Whales do not belong in tanks, they belong in the ocean! We applaud whoever did this noble deed! Set the whales free!"
"Leave those kids alone, you bastards! Animal Liberation Front!"
These boys are trying to get that whale home! You're not gonna stop them!
Save the whale!
Where are you taking the whale?
Of course. Brilliant! Release it in international waters. I'll drive the truck.
"Hang on, boys."
"You got it, kid!"
"Hurry, boys! We'll take care of them!"
"Swim, mighty whale! You're free!"
I'm afraid you're too late! The whale's been set free.
"Now you see that your ways of captivity and exploiting animals will never prevail.  Not as long as there are children like these who still believe in the beauty and magic of freedom.  For it is children, with their innocence and their spirit, who know what is truly best for all the world."
Oh my God!
