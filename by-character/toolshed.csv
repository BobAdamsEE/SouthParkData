"Why do we have to be called ""Coon and Friends""?"
"We all fight crime together. How come we're just your ""friends""?"
"Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?"
Oh Jesus...
How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?
"Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!"
To the grocery store!
There's more important things to discuss right now!
"We all voted, it was unanimous."
Toolshed!
"Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?"
"Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more!"
The Necronomicon?
"All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!"
"Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight."
"Um dude, are you okay?"
"Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home."
"Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'."
"All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing!"
"""It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu."""
"We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys."
"Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?"
"""In strange aeons even Death may die?"" What does that mean, Human Kite?"
Toolshed!
"Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you!"
"Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!"
"Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!"
"Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?"
"...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-"
"And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can...  Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?"
"...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-"
...Woo-hat?
"...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude."
"Dude, you're freaking out Mint-Berry Crunch. He's peed his pants."
"Kenny Kenny, calm down."
"Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!"
Kenny? No! No!
Uh-what?
"Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?"
"Dude, where the fuck are we?"
Oh shit!
"We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here."
"How, dude?"
Oh my God! Kenny!
"Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mint-Berry Crunch."
"Ya got poop, don't ya?"
"Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?"
Oh my God! Holy shit dude!
