My client has agreed to check herself into rehab immediately.
And what proof... do you have that the pee levels will go up?
He said he's not doing it! And as his lawyer I advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you!
"Mr. Marsh, if you don't mine, we'd like to see your bracelet."
"Joe, the blacksmith?"
I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip.
"Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice."
I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires.  Do you still object?
He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman.
"There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous."
"OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood?"
"Then you will go to London in a week's time.  Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned."
"Then I should take my leave.  Good evening, gentlemen, and we shall see you in London next week, Pip."
"You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this?"
"I should think not.  On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow."
Boys I want to thank you for coming down to my office on such short notice.
"No. Boys, I'm a lawyer. Your friend Kenny has passed away and I've called you here to read his will."
"""In the highly likely event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have."""
"To Eric Cartman: ""Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP."""
"There is one more thing I would like to ask you all, as my friends. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life-support, please,..."
I don't know. I lost the last page.
"It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours."
