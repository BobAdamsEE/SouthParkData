"We left our homes and we left our mudders
to go on a pillagin' spree!
We'll cut off your ears and break your toes
and make you drink our pee!
And if you sail into our waters,
you best hear this decree:
We'll take your boat, set your ass afloat!"
"And when you put us together you get a nation with one goal 
To thrive and prosper, with a little country and rock and roll."
