"Yes, there are incredible things we're learning about Americans in the future, Aaron. I- it appears that in the future, Americans have evolved into a hairless uniform mix of all races.

The people in the future speak a complete mix of English, Chinese, Turkish and, indeed, all world languages, which sounds something like this:  Back to you, Aaron."
