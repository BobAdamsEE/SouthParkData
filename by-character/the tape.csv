"Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
There's a place that is magical, and full of rain.
But now it needs help, because it is in pain.
Cleaning the earth is a mighty big chore
We're spreading awareness like never before!
Getting Gay With Kids is here! 
To spread the word and bring you cheer
Let's save the rainforest! What do you say?!
Being an activist is totally gay!
Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
There'll be nothing but rainforests covering the entire world!
World!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's save the rainforest! It's totally gay!
It's totally gay!"
