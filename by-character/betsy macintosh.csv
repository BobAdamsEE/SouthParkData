Whatta you want?
Oh Gohhhd.
It's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until I use again.
I don't want my baby born addicted to drugs! But I can't stop!

They said it's a boy.
How much will he make?
So what? You would make money off of my child? That doesn't seem fair.
Cain't you change the rules?
