"...Hey man, we roll how we roll, and if people are annoyed or intimidated by it, that's too bad for them!"
"But he's wrong. People don't think we're fags, do they?"
"How can they call us fags? I mean, listen to this?"
Chicken spears! Chicken spears! Chicken spears! ...Chicken spears! Chicken spears!
I'm full.
"Ohh, OHHH! Somebody took a shit on mah fuckin' Harley!"
Well they certainly ain't calling us fags 'cause we gather sticks; there's got to be more!
"Come on, fags, let's roll out!"
