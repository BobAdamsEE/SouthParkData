"Young man, your NASCAR stunt has brought a lot of attention to Vagisil and honestly, I don't know how to thank you. Our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated. I first created Vagisil for my wife, Patty. She's my Muse, my flame. We realized that NASCAR can do a lot for product recognition and so, Vagisil has a little present... for you."
Vagisil would like you to represent us in the next NASCAR race.
And we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child.
"Vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product, Chris. We want women to know that Vagisil is effective, safe for use every day,  Every. Day.  Every. Day.  And available nationwide."
"This is such a great day for Vagisil, Chris. Our product awareness will be at an all-time high. Feminine odor must be treated diligently.  Very. Diligently.  Patty? Patty?"
What?
"Let me talk to her.  Patty? Patty, what are you doing?  Patty, pull over the NASCAR. You're acting irrationally. Patty, did you forget to take your medication? You know how you get when you don't use your Vagisil. There should be some in your purse, my Muse. Patty?"
"Patty, you are my Muse, and my flame."
HAAAAAAAAAA!
Patty! How could you?! You've ruined us! You've ruined Vagisil!
