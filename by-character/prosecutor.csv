"I am, Your Honor. Johnnie Cochran."
"Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of ""Token?"""
Who is Token?
Black!  Did you say black?! You called him black?!
"O! He said it again!  He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out!"
The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!!
What?!
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This ""monster"" committed a crimeâ€”not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!"
The prosecution rests.
