"Come on, this is a great lineup."
I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig.
I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada.
"I'm sorry. Freemium gaming destroys lives. I lost my father to Candy Crush.  You need this, Lorde. And the girls out there need you. You've got till tomorrow to think it over. "
"You're nervous, it's understandable."
"You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit."
Alright that's enough!  Look at yourselves!
What are you talking about? It's great! You're the most commented-on artist in the world right now! You're blowing up twitter and you're trending on CartmanBrah. #clitnubbin
"It's not about the music, Lorde! It never was. It's about comments! And sister, you've got 'em!"
We paid a lot of money for that hologram. You'd better find a way to get it back!
What is Project Alpha?
What is that?
"Sit down, Lorde."
"Do you know what an artist is now, Lorde? An artist is a conversation piece, nothing more.  Like a vase, or a kitschy side table. Just something for people to comment on.  The old ways are dying. We're not making money off records, we're making money off tweets. And you've taken it to a whole new level."
On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about.
Who said anything about you? 
"Today, commentary IS the content. And you, I'm afraid, are just in the way. "
"It's a brave new world, starting much sooner than we thought. What we need is someone who truly gets the changing of the guard. We have an army of holograms poised to start the next chapter in American culture. How would you like to be in charge of it all?"
Glad you feel that way. We have a lot to do together. We're about to take this to a whole new level.
"I know your wife means a lot to you, Randy,  but you can't leave us hanging. You've got the purest shit out there; it's worth a lot to us."
"How many times have you said ""I think I've lost it"" and everything turned out to be okay?"
"Every time. Come on. Get back to work and see. If you get panicked again, call me."
"Sit down, Ron.  Whattaya know about one of our artists, Lorde?"
Wrong.  She's a 45-year-old man in Colorado.
"He writes the songs, sends us the demos, we fudge them, sell them as a brooding 17-year-old girl way ahead of her time, and nobody knows the difference."
"He makes good stuff. Stuff that sells. But he's getting edgy feet. I want you to keep an eye on him. And if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth, well... you know what to do."
