"I have just been briefed that the end of our country... is imminent. Goodbye, everybody. I'm going to spend my final moments on this Earth with my loved ones... watching a Tyler Perry movie. I know, it's embarrassing. But I simply can't help myself."
I am please to announce that the greatest threat to mankind is now gone forever. Justice has been done.
"I assure you all, I am heading back to the White House more motivated - more titillated - than ever."
Yes?
"Yes, hello General."
Very pleased. Thank you for your help.
You'll have what you want. I'll meet you in three hours.
"I don't know how they did it, but the Chinese secured my victory. I have to fulfill my obligation."
Don't worry. Everyone knows General Tso's chicken.
"Thank you, thank you all for your votes of confidence. If I could... just be a little rude and ask for a nice quiet meal in private?"
All right. Where are the ballots?
"General Tso, do you have the missing ballots or not?"
"Okay, you want me to come in again, we can start over, what the fuck is this?!"
I told you China would get the rights to Star Wars from Disney as long as my Presidency was secure!  Until I have those ballots  it is not secure!
