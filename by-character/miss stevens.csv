"Oh, really? Could you brush it off?"
"Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!!  Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here.  Oh my God!!"
"Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-"
"Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost.  Cah heh, can you help us?"
"Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype.  Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over!"
"Now kids, let's be a bit more ""open-minded."" I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a ""people's army."" They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government.  Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?"
"Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest.  We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San Jos√©?  Um...  Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift.. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song"
"Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography.  Oh, Kyle, please!"
"Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts."
"Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?"
Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?
"Run, children, run!"
Hello?? Anybody?? Help??
"Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay?"
Ga-ow!
"Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job!  Aaaah!"
"Eric, where are you going?"
"Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!"
"Young man, I have had it!!"
"Good! You deserve to die, you little bastard!  Eric, we have to stay together!"
No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
"Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're never going to make the festival!"
"Let's go, quickly!"
"Children, it's the Yanogapa.  Do not be afraid. We are not here to tear down your rainforest."
"Look how they live in peace with all living things. Gentle, noble...  Run for your lives, children!"
Run run ruuun!  Waaah!
"It's quicksand, people!"
"Okay. Just what the heck is going on here, people?  AAAAA!!"
"All right, that does it!!  Goddamn stupid-ass rainforest!! This place fucking sucks!!  I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!"
"Hooray, children!"
How did you know where we were?
Eric?
"What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment?"
Really?  That's great!!
"Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing!"
Does everybody remember the new lyrics?  And...
