"Our little Nelson, he's... taken a turn for the worse, I'm afraid! His cancer is... real ba-a-a-ad."
"Yeah. Oh. Doctors say this could be it. How am I supposed to do it, coach? How do I look a five year old child in the eye and tell him he's not gonna live?  You tell me, coach! You tell me how!!"
"No, I don't mean to take it out on you, coach. It's just...  I don't know what to say to him, coach. Neither of us do. What do you say tuh... somebody who's dying, huh?"
"Will you talk to him, coach? He looks up to you."
"Nah, I'm just his father. But you're his coach! You're like a father to him."
"Please, coach, he's counting on you!"
