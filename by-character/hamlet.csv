O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.
"The point!--envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work, buddih!"
"Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother."
"Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee, guy. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, buddih, That are but mutes or audience to this act,  Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you, buddih--But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest, guy; report me and my cause aright, to the unsatisfied."
"...he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Blagh."
