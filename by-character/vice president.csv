"Look, I know I messed up, all right? But I think you're right. If we can get out of the forest, we might find another place to live."
Yeah. Right behind you.

Sorry to cut the honeymoon short!
Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk!
Walk!
That's good! That's far enough!
"I'm gonna go back to the village, start to rebuild, mate with the females, become... President!"
It was a disaster! Disasters happen!
"Actually, you're never leaving here either, Travis!"
"Because when I'm President, I can't have pests like you constantly trying to preach that the world is alive! You're an idealistic fool! The world is not ""conscious,"" we are conscious! If the world was alive, it would feel this!"
You die he-
