"Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news. The school has to cancel your show."
"Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week."
"Four.  Four students watch your show. And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting a 57!"
"O-hoh, it's brilliant! It's all just video footage of animals close-up with a wide angle lens."
"It's what the students want, and it's cheaper to make than your show. Just one person and a video camera. Craig is a genius. Uh-sorry, kids."
"Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens!"
"I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. It's just that it's kind of gay."
"Boys, first of all, I want to tell you how impressed I am with your ability to get more ratings. Your show beat Close-up Animals with a Wide Angle Lens by three viewers!"
"Yes, but unfortunately, you got crushed in the ratings by Craig's new show."
"All the students love it. It's an incredible idea called Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens... Wearing Hats. Take a look.  That Craig is a freakin' genius, I tell ya. He's like... an idea machine."
"I'm afraid it's worse than that, boys. I'm gonna have to give you all F's in Extracurricular AV Class. You have to learn now how important ratings are!"
"Yes. 
And I guess your best wasn't good enough 
."
"Boys, I want to congratulate you on what is perhaps the finest piece of student television I've ever seen. Not only did you get all the students and myself off of couch medicine, but you got a 22 in the ratings!"
"Oh yes, Craig. It appears that the ratings for your show are down significantly."
"You need to know how important ratings are, Craig, so, I'm going to suspend you from school and request that you have your testicles removed surgically."
You boys are approved for twenty-seven new shows. I want you to come up with an even better idea than the cough medicine story. Get to it!
