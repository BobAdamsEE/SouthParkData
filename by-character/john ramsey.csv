"Hello, Gary. Great to see you. Chris and Linda, this is our good friend, Congressman Gary Condit.  He also lost someone close to him and thinks it something to do with the same Puerto Rican guy that hurt our kids."
"So you see, Chris and Linda, there are people like you all over the country who've been affected by Some Puerto Rican Guy."
Yeah!
