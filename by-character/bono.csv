Thank you. Thank you so much for this newest award; it means so much.  Oh. Excuse me. I must be getting another award.  Yes?
What?! That's impossible! How big was it?
"Hello everyone! I, am Bono.  For years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in Africa, and today, I have very exciting news. Last night, at twenty past eight, I took a crap weighing nine and a half Courics."
"As you can see, it is one solid piece.  It is my biggest crap to date, and I swear to its authenticity. Thank you, and God bless."
"Hello, hello."
He can't beat my nine and a half Courics!
"Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich."
"I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!"
"Get the jet ready, Bovis! I've got to be going."
"Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?"
Let him have it? Why would I do that?!
I have the first-place trophy for that.
I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.
Number two?! NUMBER TWO?!
Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!
Say I'm not number two!
That's right! I'm not!
Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out!
I had a feeling it would be.
Get him out of here!
It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!
Poppa no! Say nothing more!
No Poppa... No Poppa...
Biddy.
I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit!
