"Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate."
"And what say you, Morpheus?"
Bring him here!
I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.
"It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right."
"Imaginationland... used to be a happy place. But then the terrorists attacked.  And so many of us were killed.  The Barrier came down, and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed.  Now our final battle will take place. The evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out."
"We prepare for a battle we cannot win.  Sweet and cuddly imaginary characters, many who have never held a weapon,  must now fight for their very lives. We are too few in number,  but we have one hope. That is where you come in, young boy.  Only you can help us win this battle."
You have a power here that you have yet to understand.
"Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!"
Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.
What are you doing?! We need Santa!
BELIEVE IN SANTA! RIGHT NOW!
There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW!
Then the day is lost.
Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield!
"Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day!"
"Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!"
Cavity Creeps?
Quickly! You must imagine a giant Crest Gel!
Project Imagination Doorway?
We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!
The boy is doing it! Everything is going to be okay!
The day is ours!
Is this the boy who's been living in our realm?
M-I am.
"So, you want to live with the lions, do you?"
And what makes you think you can fit it with us?
Do you like jokes?
"Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions love jokes."
"Mmm. Then there may be hoipe in you yet, young apprentice lion. Very well. We wihill let you stay, if... you can pull this thorn from my paw.  Go on, try it. Pull my thorn! Come on! Pull my thorm!  Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho!"
He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think.
"Yes? What is it, young lion apprentice?"
Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home.
"It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum?"
Go on. It's spearmint!
"Oh. So you don't want any gum then? Are you... sure? Go on, try it!"
That is good stuhuff!
