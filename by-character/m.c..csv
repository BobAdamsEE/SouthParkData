We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV.
"With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman."
"Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit."
"I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman.  Together these boys beat their illness. With nothing but each other, and overcoming all odds , these two brave friends-"
"These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys , here is... Jimmy Buffett!"
"Alright, that was ""Sisters of Mercy Hold No Pain Against the Dark Lord,"" with their song, ""Silk Blood On The Footsteps Of My Mind (Revisited)"""
And now it's time for our final band.
"Give it up for ""Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld!"""
"Dude, this is a no-brainer. This year's Battle of the Bands winner and the band that gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalablala is... TIMMY!"
