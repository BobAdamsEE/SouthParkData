"Hi there, I'm Amanda. What are you up to?"
I'm making a pan-roasted chicken.
"Uh huh. I've just taken the chicken out of the pan. It's... so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes."
"Yeah. Ooo, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet."
Oh I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me?
I got a wooden spoon right here; it's... pretty hard.
"I was thinking about shallots, actually."
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Hello Stan!
