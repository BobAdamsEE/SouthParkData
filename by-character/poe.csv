Where am I? What is this place?
Why have the living summoned me from my rest? 
"Emos? ...Ew-oh my God, Emos are such wannabe conformists."
"Children of Darkness, I would help you, but I fear I cannot be seen with a bunch of douchey Vamp kids and their poser-ass plastic fangs."
"Agrees with who? Is that red dye in your hair or did a blood demon take a shit on your head, poser?"
Why should I? Just 'cause you summoned me doesn't mean you're the boss of me!
"Oh okay, Mom. Let's go fight the Emos, Mom."
You can't tell me what to do! Who elected you the mayor of me?!
"God, you guys are so lame!  And if you want my help, you'd better all stop calling me Edgar."
That's the name my stupid parents gave me! I like to be called by my Goth name: NightPain
What? You guys are posers!
"If one of us is a traitor, it's probably your wannabe vampire leader."
"Make me, poser."
Leave me alone! I just want coffeh.
Bitch.
I can't right now. I'm dealing with a lot and I just have a lot of anxiety.
What's the point? Save some people so some other people can be lame? And then those lame-os can be lamer to some other posers?
"Okay, I'm here, posers."
What do you want me to do?
Really? Shoot a plant?
Wait a minute. What is this?  This says it was bought at Lowe's Home and Garden for $29.95. 
"No, they're just, like, ficus plants and vibrating pots."
