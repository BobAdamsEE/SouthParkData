"You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do?"
That's stupid.
I can't dance without the machine.
Okay. I'll give it a shot.
Hey I heard about this guy in Como who has a duck that can dance.
That don't look like a dancing duck to me.
What? I don't wanna get served.
Can he move it?
You did it!
