"Hi kids, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams and I just need to get some info from you. Does that sound okay?"
"No, sorry. Now,  I've been looking over your file and I see you kids have all been horribly physically and emotionally abused.  Oh whoops, that isn't your case file, it's the Penn State University Gazette.  I'm joking, that's just a joke, we like to have fun here.  It is your case file. I was just all like ""it's the Penn State Gazette"" to be like a joke, we have fun. Now listen, you're gonna be put into a foster home, so I need to know... would you like to go to Neverland Ranch, a Catholic church, or Penn State University?  We're havin' fun here, aren't we? I just, I come up with these and the guys, it's good to laugh.  I just asked them if they wanted to go to Neverland, a Catholic church, or Penn State.  I'm a trickster. People say I'm really meant for comedy. Here's my head shot just in case you know anybody.  Can't hurt, right? Okay, now, are we all startin' to feel a little bit better?  Oh come on now, how about that smile? I'm gonna GET  you to smile! I'm gonna GET  you to smile!  A Penn State administrator walks into a bar. Where's that smile? How about this one? Joe Paterno doesn't walk into a police station. Come on, that's a good one."
"Hi there, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams, and I'm with Child Protective Services.  Here's my head shot.  I just need to get some information from you if that's okay."
"Okay, now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab."
"And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime? Because at Penn State they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. That's a joke. Did you get that one? It's a play on words, we like to have fun here."
"We just - no, we just like to have fun here."
"What? What, is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You think you're funny?"
Could be worse.
"Could be in Happy Valley! On a scale from 1 to 10, how old should you be to stay away from Penn State?"
Two Penn State administrators walk into a butt-!
"I know this is a difficult adjustment for you, Eric! But you can't just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who can't defend himself! I mean, what do you think this is?! The shower room at Penn State?! I'm kidding. We like to have fun in our department, so I was like, ""Oh, look. What? Is this like the shower room at Penn State?!"" I joke around. This is my head shot."
"Oh! Oh, and ""your momma"" jokes are better?! They've been around since the '50s!"
"Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, I received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda?"
It's my business because Child Protective Services is accountable for these kids!  Have I given you my head shot?
"Okay now, are you only giving these kids Dr Pepper to drink?"
Excuse me!  Let's have a look around.
Oh my God.  What's going on here?
"What have I done?  I took you kids from your parents without even checking into where you were going! I put innocent children in a dangerous environment! What am I, a recruitment coach for Penn State?  It's not funny!"
"No, no, take all these kids back to their parents! We've embarrassed the system and made it something nobody wants to be a part of! It's like a Penn State homecoming party!"
