"Ooo, look at this, honey.  A beautiful unspoiled town in the Rockies. This is just what we've been looking for!"
We could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing! And then I could finally live like a cowboy.
O kids?
How would you like to move to the Colorado Rockies?
You bet!
"Well, here it is. Our home to be."
"Why thank you, young man. We're the Smiths."
"How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Token while your mother and I check out the town."
"Great, Snoop Dogg, and you?"
"Great, Snoop-Snoop. Listen: Remember how we always talked about wanting to buy property up in the mountains so our kids could ski and ride horses?"
"Well I found the place, Snooty-roo. It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered, laid-back, and beautiful."
You really should come give it a look. Jada and I would love for some friends to move here with us.
"Great! Well, let me let you get back to your recording."
Bye.
So we're uniting and marching on the town square!
What?
We'll give you a hundred dollars.
"And so it is with great determination that us decent rich Americans have gathered to say: ""We will be separated no more!"""
AAAaaahhh!
Kids! Go find the limo and get in!
I didn't know!  I.. DIDN'T... KNOHOHOHOW...
