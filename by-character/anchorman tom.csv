"The government efforts to stop the Peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day.  In cities all over the world  flute bands have been removed and quarantined.  But more may still be out there. Homeland Security's requesting that  if you see a Peruvian flute band, do not approach it. Mark down the flute band's location, and do not, under any circumstances, buy their CDs.  The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantined area in Miami."

"Okay obviously something different has uh shown up a-... Did he say ""furry""?  Okay uh we're we're experiencing some uh-  My God what is that thing?!  AAAHHH!!"
