"Alright Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with."

Oh! I can't... go on.
Ohh. It's over! We're free!

"Noo, that doesn't make sense!"
Uh-meaning what?
"Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady."
"Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics.  E-yes, what is it?"

"Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?"
"Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it.  Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady."
"Bzzzt! Wrong! Try again, dumbass! Hahahahahahaha  hahahaha!  Okay, okay. Maybe we should try something a little easier. We can work our way up to the hard ones.  Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared."

"Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A."
