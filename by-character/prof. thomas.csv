"Thank you, Mayor.  Now look, everyone, Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what Family Guy is going to do... because they've wrongly grouped us together. Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know... that we had no part in the Mohammad episode. That even though the episode aired, we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it, and we didn't talk about it."
"We bury our heads. In sand.  We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks, fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue. By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels, we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes, and then have the person to our left bury them. If we can manage to get every person's head buried deep, deep in sand before the Mohammad episode airs, we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all."
"If you have children, be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own."
"Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and... not have his head in the sand."
"You realize by not burying your head in sand, you'll appear to be a part of the Family Guy audience."
"If we all bury our heads in sand,  we can avoid being any part of this."
