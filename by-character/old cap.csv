What madness is this?? 
A new Elmo doll. They're releasing a new Emo doll  just in time for Black Friday.
"You've murdered us!  You soulless monsters, you've killed us all! "
"I'll deal with these demons!  If you are here for Black Friday, the line starts on that side of the rope. "
"That's the line for Black Friday, so other people can do normal shopping today."
"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
"Listen, uh... I know why you took this part-time job."
"I see it in you. You care about people.  Same reason I do it every year.  You remind me of my son. He died on Black Friday in '89. Guess I'm still trying to save him.  Look, I just want to say I... I really appreciate what you're doing. I promised my wife this would be my last Black Friday I worked. When I see folks like you, it... makes me hopeful that people will still be okay."
"No, damn it!  No lining up behind the velvet rope!  God they just don't listen! "
"Back! Back, all of you!  If that's how you are, there'll be no wristbands! No go! "
Back away! 
You did good. The watch is yours now.
"This is what we signed up for. Right, my friend?"
"Heh. Now you know how serious this is. Whatever your intentions before, protect this town. You are in charge now. Take this.  Don't let... Black Friday... be the end. "
