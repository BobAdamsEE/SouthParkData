Excuse me. Have you boys seen a leprechaun anywhere lately?
"Ooooo, then you did see him.  That's splendiferous! I want you to tell me everything he said. Where was he? What was he doing?"
"Well of course they are. But just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real. Haven't you boys ever used your imagination?  You young man! How would you like to be a cowboy? Or a- swashbuckling pirate?  And you! How would you like to be an astronaut, faaar out in space? All it takes is a little...  imagination."
"Still not convinced, eh? I tell you what, boys. What say we all take a ride on my... Imagination Flying Machine?"
"Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you."
Ubeuh... uh... n... no?
"All aboard the Imagination Balloon! 
Some people feel imagination isn't real, but I tell them that they're wrong,
'cause whenever I want to play and pretend, I just sing the Imagination Sooong
."
"Oh- Ohhh. But my boy, we're already here."
This... is Imaginationland.  It's where all the wonderful and goofy things that humans have made up over the years live together.  Citizens of Imaginationland! We have distinguished guests from the world beyond!
"Now, good news, everyone! These boys did see the leprechaun!"
OH FUCK NO!
No! It's just a Care Bear!
They're going something to Rockety Rocket.
The only reason they would-  Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier!
The wall! The wall which separates the evil side of Imaginationland from the good side!
"Don't you get it?! If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over Imaginationland for good! YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!!"
That was your plan to stop them??
That's fucking stupid!  They are coming...
This... is Imaginationland.
"If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out!"
"Hey, wake up, stupid!  Come on, wake up, kid!"
NO! You passed out and peed your pants!
"Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest!  Come with me, little boy! I'm going to get you home!"
"Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times."
"NO, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke!"
Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope!
"Through the Gumdrop Forest. Others will be hiding there; go, run! Look out for the evil characters! They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain!"
"Oh look, I'm back!"
The evil characters! They're all behind the wall again.
"Whatever you imagine to be real, is real."
