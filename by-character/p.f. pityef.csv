"Welcome, welcome, to the P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory. How can I be of service?"
"Ah, I see you're wearing one of our brown scauses already. Delightful. What color would you like your new scause to be?"
Well of course! You came for a scause to wear on your paws. And you want others to wear yours upon thaurs.
"Hm. Perhaps I should start from the beginning. 
In the modern age there are those who believe
That a cause is a thing to be worn on one's sleeve. 
And so, we sell a cause. It's called a scause.
And wearing a scause gets you lots of applause. 
We start with some plastic which is shirped by our shirpist
Then dip it in colors that show off your purpose.
There are green scauses for recycling, blue scauses for kitties, 
And pink scauses that focus on nothing but titties. 
Do you hate abortion? Ah! Then a white scause is for you! 
Why not champion your scause with some sparkles and glue?
We make scauses for this! We make scauses for that! 
Why there's even a scause for just being fat! 
What's the matter? Can't think of a scause? 
How about raising awareness for the hairs in your schnozz?
Let's just think of the thing that you care about most. 
Then let's make it orange, like marmalade toast!
And now I'd like to say ""thank you"" for your coming down.
I'm off to go sell these in your little town!"
"One at a time, please. One at a time."
"Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I'll give you two more!"
Absolutely! Five dollars please.
"Oh my, it's the sound!"
"Of all sounds in all sounddom this one's most profound.  That's the sound that means I must pack up my tent. It's the sound of the last cent being spent.  My work here is done, and just look at you now! You're all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow. Enjoy all your scauses. You look great in your cause. Be sure to give each other lots of applause. I'm off to the next town in my little truck. Have a nice day! Toot a loo!"
No please! Please show mercy!
