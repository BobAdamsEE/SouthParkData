What's his name?
"Oh, is he a nice boy?"
"That's great, Kip!"
I'ts amazing! You know Kip spent the morning at the boy's farm?
"Oh, what'd he say about those?"
"I thnk the more time you spend with your little friend, the better."
Have fun and be safe!
"No, he's been out spending the whole day with his best friend Kyle. I think they're at the movies now."
