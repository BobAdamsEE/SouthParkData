"Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland."
"Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers.  But if we all behave and respect each other, I'm sure we can make this a fun and productive day. Let's start with roll call. Let's see, mmmmm.  Eric Cartman?"
"Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?"
"Okay, and where iiiiss… Kenny McCormick?"
"Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today.  I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days — Kyle Broflovski?"
"Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it."
"Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too."
I don't care! Get down here and do it!
"Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club."
"I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year.  Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has been… Cartman."
"Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, I want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on."
"Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, children, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay, and half think the flag should be changed."
"Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the ""Flag Should Stay The Way It Is"" team?"
"Alright. Stan and Kyle,  you can both be the team leaders for the ""Flag should stay the way it is"" team.  Now, who wants to lead the ""Flag should be changed"" team?  Okay, Wendy and Eric can team up."
"Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate!"
"Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club.  I r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well, so, perhaps the children can shed some light on us. We'll start with Wendy Testaburger on the ""Flag Should Be Changed"" team."
"Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point?"
What?
