"Hey Eric, where's Kyle?"
Hey yeah!
Okay.
"That's it, I'm dead!"
"Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning in the news."
"Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan."
"It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal."
"That's easy for you to say, Stan."
That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
"If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not ""fighting"" anybody."
"Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now."
"You just don't get it, Stan!"
"Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people!"
Sooo black people are midgets.
I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!
"No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!"
Nothing!
No!
"Now you get it, Stan."
"Thanks, dude."
Yeah. Me neither.
What the hell?!
... I don't want the code name Blackie.
Whoa.
Go Stan!
"Yeah, Stan!"
Who do they say is the ugliest?
I'm number two? Wow.
She is pissed off.
"Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so."
Yes.
"Good job, Butters!"
"You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw!"
I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!
"Oh! Sure, that works."
I can't believe it's him.
"Okay good, yeah."
"Oh God, how embarrassing."
"Aw, damn it."
I can't help it!
I can't believe it's finally over.
"Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy."
Base!
Why?
He's gone!
Why are you involving me in this?
Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?
This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!
You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!
That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.
I don't know.
A motion detector.
Nuh-uh!
Why?! Why are you happy for me?!
Nothing!
No!
NO.
AAA!
Where is everybody? What's goin' on??
Hey! In here!
"Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on."
Oh... Good.
It sure was.
"Yeah. Now that it's over, I.. I guess it was kind of fun."
I'd like that.
Hey Nichole.
Sure!  What's up?
Oh.
Okay...
"I think, you're really great."
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around.
Yeah.
Yeah I guess.
Yeah.
"Yeah, we're through."
I'm sorry Kyle. I like girls.
Hi.
I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black.
There are still people who will look at us funny. That think we're supposed to be together.
"I don't care, either."
YAY!
"Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness."
"Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television."
"At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything."
"Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air."
"He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I."
"He's chubby,  he's filthy , and he's just a little bit nuts.  Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo!"
Come in.
"I helped you make a documentary, Kyle."
"Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television."
"I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?"
"But she's not black, Kyle. She's white.  The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up.  Not by us, or anyone else."
It actually aired last night.
"Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo."
"Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-"
"That's good, Fatty, get pissed!"
"Yeah, Fatty!"
What the hell is going on?
Nothing.
Yeah.
"I uhhh, have band practice."
"Fuck you, Brad Pitt!"
I'm good.
"Okay, really?"
...What jury?
I don't know what to say.
This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.
Can I go back to class now?
"Alright, that's enough!  You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?!"
What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!
He's just out looking for trouble.
You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!
So what?!
Fuck you!
Oh!
An apology?! He shot me!
Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law!
And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!
"If you know of a way, wizard, then speak."
"Wow, she's hot."
"Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags."
"Come on guys, let's go!"
"Yeah, they left."
"What the-? Damn, baby."
That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
"Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!"
Oh!
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime."
And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.
"""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."""
What are we gonna do?!
"Come on! Hurry up!  Hey, what are you guys doin'?"
"Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks."
"Yeah, that turkey sucks."
But what are we gonna do?
Six!
How do they eat?
"Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.  I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months."
"I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik."
Alright!
My family isn't rich.
But I...
Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park?
I know. But why?
All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.
"I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!"
"I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please."
I'm sure.
"That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting."
Come on!  Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think?
"It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants."
Hey you guys.
I sure did.
"Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart."
Here you go.
It's a DVD of the Lion King
I only have this.
What's a VHS?
"Why can't I be like all the other kids?
They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns.
And cut-up hot dogs for lunch
It's not my fault my parents succeed so much.
There's no one in town I can relate to.
I play with autographed baseball bats
while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones
Has a boy ever felt so alone?
Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something I'm not
If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got.
If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around,
So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down.
Please, God, send more rich kids...
To my...
Town"
Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood!
I'm Token.
"Aah, he's a lawyer. I think."
"All right!  Thanks, God."
...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.
"You do? God, that's great!"
"I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  low to  middle-income."
"Well, they never really had any money."
Well I... think that.. they...
...That's ...great.
Hi.
"Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding."
Oh. Alright then.
"Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms?"
This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight?
I don't fit in anywhere.
"Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be.  Uuuh, yeah."
RRrrr!!
Roar!
"You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!"
Who's Aslan?
Are... you... Aslan?
"Well, I'm Token"
Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.
"Well, I don't know."
What?
...I like jokes a lot.
So can I stay?
Huuuunh  Aslan.
...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.
"They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best."
...No thanks.
"No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger."
Ow.
"Jesus, lions suck!"
Hey guys.
"You mean, you want me around?"
"Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich."
"That's right, huh?"
"You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich."
You're not?
Wait! I liked being ripped on for being rich better!
All right!
"Well, what am I supposed to do?"
"Aaaah. Oh, I know."
"I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with."
I'm gonna start saying that now.
Here comes a sedan.
"""If I could be Bebe.""  ""If I was Bebe I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."""
Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.
Yeah. What the hell happened to us?
"I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape,  just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me.  The fate of Middle-earth... is in my hands."
I'm not playing anymore.
"I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out."
"...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too?  Five midgets, spanking a man... covered in Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love?"
How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before.
"When was the last guy you had a manicure, straight man?"
What?! We don't have a bass guitar.
"Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement."
"So, what are we doing?"
I'm out.
I don't know how to play bass.
I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!
God-damnit!
Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?
"This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!"
What did you say?!
Why the hell would I be looking way over there??
"Cartman, what the hell is all this?"
But you spent all the money we made!
Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.
"Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!"
What?! How did that happen?
Whoa! Where'd you get those?!
"And I am Black Chaku,  with the power of perfect spelling!"
Butters!
Butters!
"Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?"
"Wow, those animals are pretty cute."
Action News!
Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive.
Huh?
"No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead."
"Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute!"
"That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay."
We did that!
Cough medicine?
Yeah. It was great.
"The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise.  Theradryl DM. For kids.  Dexa Cough, children's formula."
Those wings don't look very strong.
There has to be another way!
Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?
Nothin'
Yeah.
I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
...Yeah?
We were at why I should give you ten percent.
"Well, I guess that makes sense. All right."
You'll never find...As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do...
"Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, babyBut I'm the one who loves youAnd there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else."
"... (you're gonna miss my lovin')I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove."
Here you go.
Thanks.
Are you serious?
Oh my God! Okay!
"Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me."
"Send a cress in your plates, folks?"
"Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here?"
"Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home."
No!
Ignoring him? How come?
Oh yeah.
"Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you."
Ginger kids eat in the hallway!
What are you doing?
...What do we do?
