"Good morning, students! How are we all feeling today?  I would like to share with you all my-"
"That, that words are like bullets. And if you give-"
"No, no, it's okay. He'll run out of steam here pretty soon."
"Principal Victoria, I'm very concerned about the behavior of one of your students."
"Why? I don't feel terrible. It doesn't bother me at all.  Words are like bullets, and I let 'em pass right through me.  I just know that with some one-on-one time together with this Eric Cartman, I have a chance to change the way he thinks."
"You don't understand.  You see, words are like bullets. And if you take away the gunpowder-"
"You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless."
"You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing."
"No matter how you act, I can rise above it!"
Shut your fucking mouth!
"He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking"
Aaaaaaa!
"Excuse me: over here, please? All right, I need all students to join me over here."
"I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, ""Hello, fatso!"""
"He has to learn his lesson! You see, words are like bullets.  All right all right, here he comes."
"Now you know how it feels.  You didn't like it when the tables were turned, did ya?"
You can't get to me! Words are like bullets!
"Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point."
"AAAA! Ow! Ow! Okay!  Okay, you win!"
Ung-cle!
"Caroline, don't go into the light!"
There! Now you all see that I am not limited by my size.  I have proven my point! My work here is done!
"Oh... R- Randy... Uh, I'm surprised to see you here."
"Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message? Ooo, this is awkward. Well, the thing is, Randy, you've been- replaced."
"Well we found an immigrant from the future who knows geology and he offered to work for next to nothing. Uh, this is Mr. Glughgogawk."
"I'm... sssorry, Randy. It's just, with all the budget cuts and all, we'll give you some time to clean out your desk. Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk. I'll show you to the copy room."
