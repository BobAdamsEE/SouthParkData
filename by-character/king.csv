"My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve, who,. with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms."
"All right. Chris, the whole world is waiting. Why don't you show us what stem-cell research has done for you.  Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks? Now, Chris, there're some people who say stem-cell research is wrong, that takling cells from a fetus is... unethical."
"And how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells, Chris?"
Wow.  Wow.
