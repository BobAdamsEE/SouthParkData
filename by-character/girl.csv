Shut up! I hate you! I hate you!
I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for?
"Oh, not much, just hanging around-"
"We sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named _________ goes and gets her cats, and we'll just cheese all day long."
I would like to-
"Stop touching me, Elmo!Â "
Mommy!
Grandpa!
"You lied to me, Mother. You said it was the real Mr. Hankey."
"I will not forget this, Mother. I will not forget this, ever."
Give it to me!
What?
"I want a horse. I want a big brown horse with a brown-and-black tail, and a diamond tiara-  Ah!"
Who are you?!
"Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!"
"This way, you pathetic squirt of vaginal discharge!  This way, you beef-witted shriveled-up monkey's penis.  Up here, you gamy mass of baby vomit!  In here."
"I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine!"
I don't wanna to go to hell.
I want Ike to be president!
"Robby! Robby, no!"
Me neither.
Eeww.
Doggie?
Can we have horses?
"Look at the little black lion, Mommy."
Is this the South Park Crime Unit?
I lost my dolly.
"If I knew where it was, it wouldn't be lost."
Hi Jimmy.
What's he do?
"Talk to you, Bertha."
Sure. Come on in.
Ron Howard?
What is it?
Shut the door!
