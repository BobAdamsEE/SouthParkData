This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.
"The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it."
Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys.  Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest.
And here is a three-toed sloth.
"Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature."
"What's the matter, little boy?"
"Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it.  Oh!!  Agh."
