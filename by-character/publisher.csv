"First and foremost, Mr. Garrison, I would like to thank you for choosing Harequin Romance."
"Uh yes, Mr. Garrison, we did read your book."
"Well, uh, frankly, Mr. Garrison, n-we don't know if the Harequin Romance label is appropriate for you."
"Mr. Garrison, uh... are you aware that the word ""penis"" occurs six-thousand and eighty-three times in your novel?"
"Nnnno, I don't think that this book really qualifies as a ""romance novel."""
"No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call... gay. Really, really gay."
It's just that the focus really seems to be on the... male organs.
It is.
Hmmm.
