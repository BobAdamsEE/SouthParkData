"Oh, you knight."
"Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you."
What's the problem?
"Oh, I know just the song for you.
There's got to be a morning after
if we can hold on to the night"
"Hello, children!"
"This is so wonderful! Let's sing! 
There's got to be a morning after."
"Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie."
Huh?
A what?
"Boys, you know how silly that sounds, don't you?"
"Boys, come here. I want to explain this to you. I know Chef is your friend, but Chef is a grown man. He has needs you boys can't fulfill. He wants a life with me because I make him happy. Do you understand?"
"Good. Oh and boys. Just one more thing. I'm going to marry Chef tomorrow,  And there's not a God-damned thing you can do about it!  Toodle-oo!"
Children! That hurts my feelings.
I do!
There's got to be a morning after.
I'll take care of them!
Aaargh!
Noooo!
