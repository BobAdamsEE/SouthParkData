"Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?"
"All right, that'll be 6000 credits."
This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.
"Oh, all right, then I have to have 6000 credits."
"Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present."
"Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you."
Hey. What do you think you're doing?
"You aren't welcome in this store, ""nigger"" guy."
"Ma'am, is that your son over there?"
Tourette's Syndrome?
Oh...
Yeah.
It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.
Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?
"One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid,  seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches.  Okay, is that everything, little boy?"
"Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each."
"...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats."
"Oh, you boys are  like that, huh?"
Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
"Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?"
The North Pole?  Who the hell goes to the North Pole?
Take a number and wait with everyone else.
Take a number and wait with everyone else!
"Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya."
Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.
"What do you mean ""back then""? Don't forget, it's 1864."
"Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time."
"Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-"
"Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time."
Yeppir!
"Finally, a fella that talks some sense."
"Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is."
"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!"
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert."
"Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?"
"Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh.  Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh."
"I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?"
Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.
"Hm... that's improbahbluh,  but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you."
"Have a good flight. Next, please?"
I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?
Can I help you sir?
"Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here."
Sure. New state laws say it's okay.
Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.
"Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary."
"I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store."
Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.
"Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure."
"Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous."
"Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour."

"All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar."
"All right, you guys look ready to zipline!"
"Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others."
"Alright, our last zipliners are here."

"Hello, can I help you?"
You wanna return it?
The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it? 
"Uhh, noo, somebody has to control it."
"I'm sorry, but we don't do returns. "
"Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it. "
"Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?"
"Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes."
That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
"I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train."
What?! Why the hell would they do that?
"No can do, sonny."

Damn it!  Just like all the other returns!
"Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it."
"Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down."
Why? I don't know. I was drunk.
"Well, that certainly would explain a lot."
"Well, like this.  I've been wondering what the hell this was."
I can't give you your money back.
No! I won't take it back!
"All right, you win."

What the hell are you talking about?
That'll be six dollars.
We don't take pubes!
