"Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something."
"Getting readings from the other side... the, that's it. We've made an opening to our imagination, sir!"
What is it?!
"Nine one one, what's your emergency?"
Taken hostage where?
You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?
Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.
"Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves."
Five dollars for three balls.
"Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth."
"Okay, we've got a player!"
"Okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper."
It's gotta go through her mouth
"Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars."
"Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts."
Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
"Just three tickets, boys.  Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?"
Sure. It's veery scary.
Keep your hands in at all times.
"So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS!"
"Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!  All right, boys. Ride's over."
"Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets."
Can I help you boys.
"O-kay, five dollars for three balls."
"Sure, as long as they're good."
"Sorry, kid. Try again."
Uhwhat are you doing?
Shenanigans?
"Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son.  Here you go.  There, you see? We have a winner!"
"Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick."
"Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those."
"You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade them in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
"Step on up, just five dollars to play!"
"Hello, and welcome to Voice Box Express, your #1 source for voice boxes. I'm Amanda. How may I help you?"
"Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride here at the John Denver Experience. Have fun."
"I'm sorry, but we're done doing freak shows for now. We're looking for people for a new topic."
Please help my out-of-control child.
Really?  Is your mother in tears every day over how disobedient you are?
Does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age?
"Well that's great! If you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out."
