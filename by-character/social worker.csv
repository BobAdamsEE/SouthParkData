Nonsense! You did drugs! I suppose you forgot all about your family.
And you lost your job.
"Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an adult.  The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them. There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's called college! Now, I want you to repeat after me: Drugs are bad."
Drugs are bad.
"Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are fully recovered."
Just one more thing.  Remember that you can stay sober.
