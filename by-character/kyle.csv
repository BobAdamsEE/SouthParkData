Going away? For how long?
"Draw two card, fatass."
Yeah!
Chef! I can't believe you're back!
"Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef."
Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles!
Like what?
Weirdo.
Good.
...Chef?? A-are you okay?
This doesn't make any sense!
"Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!"
"Chef, the police are asking questions about you!"
"Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!"
"He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things."
"Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex."
"All right, come on guys!"
"Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?"
"Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids."
"Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!"
...Dude!
"Dude, what are you doing?!"
Just what the hell is that thing?!
HA! I knew it!
The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!
"All right, come on."
"Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club."
"But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!"
No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
"Come on, Chef! You can do it!"
...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?
We're not going anywhere without Chef.
No! Hey!
"Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!"
"Chef, come on!"
Here!
Get outside!
"Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?"
"No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??"
CHEF!
You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!
"We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains."
"And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all."
"Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off!"
"Dad, I think Ike is starving to death."
What?!
"Dad, can we go home, please?"
"But Dad, I want-"
"Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?"
Helping my Dad give people fake tickets.
"Dad, let's just go!"
"Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you."
We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too...
...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm...
...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
You do??
"Righ!  Okay, good."
What??
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
So... what do you do for fun?
"Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff."
"Yeah, fine, Dad."
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
"The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls."
Hey Stan.
NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!
"Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it."
Yeah!
"Yeah, I guess so."
"Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass!"
I have no idea!
I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
"Okay you guys, check it out."
"Dude, it's a good show."
"Hehaha, heh."
That's it? That's all they did?
"Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!"
Uhhh...
"Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!"
"Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea."
"No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad."
Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
"All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!"
Dad? Are you sure there's time?
No!
Ike? Iiike!  Ike!
Ike!  This way!  Iiike!
Nooooo!
"I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled."
"Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before."
"It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together."
"I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that."
I got some sound advice... from an old friend.
Yeah!
I'm set! Let's do this!
"We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time."
Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!
What are you talking about?!
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
What?  CARTMAN!
Ahhh!
No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH!
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
You just want Family Guy off the air...
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!
"What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?!"
Who?
Thanks a lot for the ride.
I'll do everything I can.
Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?
"Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air."
"Oh thanks, dude."
"Hello? This can't be right, I-  Ow!"
"Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?"
Cartman!
You fat sun of a bitch!
"Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!"
"Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!"
WHAT?!
Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!
That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!
There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP!
Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
Ow. Quit it!
Ow. Quit it!
"No more timeouts, fatass!"
"Thanks, kid."
Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!
Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
What manatees??!!
"No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!"
"Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!"
Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!
You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
"Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here."
"Do the right thing, Mr. President."
"I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more."
"If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is."
Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.
Yes!
Dick Cheney?
ManBearPig?
"Just play the game, fatass!"
"Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!"
We know.
"Okay, Mr. Marsh."
He's half man and half bearpig
That doesn't make any sense.
"Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction."
"Yeah, we've got school anyway."
What do ManBearPig droppings look like?
What?
What are you doing?!
Hello?
We're trapped in here!
"Hello, help!"
Forget it! They can't hear us!
"A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here."
"You see anything, Kenny??"
"Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??"
"Cartman, you okay??  You need help??"
It looks like we're completely sealed in.
Maybe we should go for it.
Why?
"No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon."
"Aw, dude!"
"They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?"
"Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!"
C-Cartman?
"Dude, what are you doing?"
"Dude, get away from me!"
"Stan! Stan, wake up!"
"No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him."
"We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die."
Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
Come on come on! Pull!
What the hell is that??
What the hell is that?  Oh my God.
Ruuun!
Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
Yes you can!
I need your help!
We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
"Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?"
You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
You'er not staying at my house either.
"Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool."
"NO, Cartman!"
"We're over here, by the cart."
"If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!"
"Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven."
See where I am? It's this way.
"Wow, look at all these people playing right now."
Who is this?
It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel.
You bastard!
Who is that guy?
"The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!"
He's targeting us.
"Ike, look out!"
"We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times."
Boars?
"Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?"
"Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts."
Me too.
"Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range."
"Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?"
What's the autolocate macro?
"Okay, right behind Stan."
Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.
"No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage."
Cast on him again.
Aaaa...  AH! Huh?!
Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah!
I can't. Just leave me behind.
"I'm out of mana, I told you."
Attack!
Yeah yeah.
That was such über pwnage
Oh yeah.
"Oh God, here we go again! 9-11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!"
Not yet.
Will you shut up about 9-11!
Because anybody who thinks 9-11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
"Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth."
Where did you hear that?
"Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?"
"Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?"
Oh no...
Oh Christ...
Me??!
"Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters?"
"All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9-11!  God-damnit!"
Terrible.
"But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9-11."
Aaaah!
"I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there."
It's not my fault.
Really?
......Dude.
They are?
What? No no no.
...That's retarded.
There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
Code 234
What is it?
Anthrax?!
"Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!"
"Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding."
"Uh, Mr. President, my name is-"
Really?
No. Way.
...Really??
...Really??
It just... doesn't seem right.
"Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out."
Hey!  Dude. You're alive?  Come back here!
Dude! What the hell is going on?!
"Dude, we aren't going to kill you."
Who the fuck are you?!
Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
You f-figured this thing all out?
Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9-11?
I knew it! You didn't plan 9-11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
Stan! What the fuck?!
You knew this whole time? Why?
What??
So you blamed the government?!
"So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?"
"So then, who was responsible for 9-11?"
Huh?
What's he doing at his teacher's house?
"Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello?"
"Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??"
Really?! What's there not to understand?!
"He's a little young, don't you think?!"
All right! We're getting the hell out of here!
"Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom."
Ike?
This is nuts.
"Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher?"
"Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot."
"Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-."
"Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-"
"Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!"
"Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously."
"Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student."
"Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman."
Yeah. She's having sex with a boy.
"Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson."
Yeah.
Yes.
"What?! No, you don't understand-"
Yeah.
I think so.
Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
"Guys, can I talk to you?"
"I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-"
"Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!"
The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
"""stick it inside her and pee"""
"You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways!"
They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
Well they're doing it!
"Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman."
"Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best."
What?
I'm dead to you?
What?
"Ike, are you okay?  Ike?  Iiiike!"
"Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do."
How do you know that?
Who's Beth?
"Can we get going now, please?!"
Oh crap!
"No! Ike, don't do it!"
"Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you."
"Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship."
Ike!
I am doing it.
Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...
"Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!"
Prove it!
"You're afraid to do it, too."
He's right. It's just a spook story.
"I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true."
...Smalls.
Holy crap!!
See? You can still make it for the end of the party.
Will you shut up already?!
"Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient."
No.
"You'll die, retard!"
"Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you."
Hello?
Hello?
What do you want?!
"I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!"
... Uh huh.
... I'm hanging up now.
"Suck my balls, fatass."
"Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you!"
"You got it, Stan!"
"Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous."
"All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan."
"Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?"
I don't know.
"Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate."
I have no idea.
I don't get it either.
...Huh?
Is this all you brought us here to see?
Butters is staying over tonight?
"Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters."
Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
"I mean, that if-"
Hrrugh!
Dude!
"No dude, that makes you gay!"
"You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!"
Yeah huh!
Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
"Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman."
The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
...Idiot.
"What are you talking about, fatass?"
"You figured that out, huh?"
Except for us.
And all the people we tell.
Like what?
"Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't."
"Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on."
"Okay, my turn."
Where's what?
Let go of me.
Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!
I don't have it!
Shut up!
"Ow! Quit it, dude!"
He isn't actually going to show everyone...
You know what? I'll bet it was you!
This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
"Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal."
It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
It was him. It had to have been him!
"What's this about, Cartman?"
"That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!"
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
"All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test."
It doesn't prove anything!
No way.
"Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried."
"Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me."
"I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it."
Yeah?
"What? No, I'm sick."
"Dude, leave me alone."
What? Why?
"All right, all right."
"Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?"
Over a hundred.
White Stripes
What?
Dude.
"Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school."
I guess so.
Wuh what doesn't follow?
Okay.
"Yeah. Actually, there is."
There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman?
So then maybe you're wrong.
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
Yeah.  What is that?
God damn it Cartman!
"I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for ""Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally"" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos."
"Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally."
"No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?"
Oh that's a good idea.
"Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay."
Hey.
What's going on?
...Homeland Security?
Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
"Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest."
...Not anymore you're not.
"I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British."
All right! MapQuest the address!
Good thinking
"Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us."
"...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!"
...Maybe.
...That is so missing the point.
"The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-"
No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
What happened?
...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
"Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea."
"Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag?"
The history of Easter.
It kind of looks like... an egg.
Who is Saint Peter?
Peter Rabbit.
I don't see it.
I don't believe it.
So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
So what now?
You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
"You swore on the cross, fatso!"
Don't you have any superpowers?
What?
N-no way! Do it yourself.
"Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus."
Don't make me do this.
Eric Cartman can never know about this.
"Happy Easter, Jesus."
...Jesus?
"Oh God, here we go again."
Our whole weekend is shot.
They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
"He catches the feesh so, then he can make money."
You said you all wrote essays.
"Dude, we're totally fucked now!"
"This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!"
Son of a bitch!
"Jimmy, did you finish your book report?"
We're dead.
Really?
Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something.
Fine.
"You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something."
Really?
"Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!"
"God damn it, that wasn't my idea!"
"Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars."
"No, that... I thought that was a lot."
You're welcome.
Oh crap.
I don't know.
He did?
"Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night."
"Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason."
"I don't want you to jump them, retard!"
Oh my God.
"Holy shit, dude!"
"Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy."
"You barely made it over one, fatass!"
God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
What's it doing?
What about you?
We're nine.
"Shut up, Cartman!"
"Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!"
"You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park!"
I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
"No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea."
That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
"All right, hit it."
"City of Brentwood
They take really good care
of all their homeless"
"Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there."
"Did Cartman just say ""shitballs"" to the principal?"
What?
He's faking.
"You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!"
Who cares about saying whatever you-?
"Grrhh, whatever."
Will you knock it off already?!
"Don't push me, asshole!"
"No! Up yours, fatboy!"
"Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!"
"N-no, I'm just saying that I think-"
"L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun."
Dude...
"Aw, come on!"
"Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh-"
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
"Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!"
...Scotch?
"You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!"
"It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice!"
What did you say?
You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole!
"Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?"
You sure you don't wanna back out?
"All right, then we go with the plan. Just like ""To Catch A Predator"".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219."
"Surprise, fatass!"
"I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa."
"Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?!"
What?
"No, I- I beat you!"
"This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story."
"Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!"
This is fucking retarded!
"Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!"
"Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!"
"You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!"
"Dad, where do leprechauns come from?"
So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
I thought I did.
"Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!"
"I'm not doing it, fatass!"
Just get out of here!
I don't care if I signed an agreement!
"That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls."
Hey dudes.
How was what?
"I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!"
"Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this."
All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
Dude.
Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
"STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!"
Dude!
"A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God."
"Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night."
...And then it got attacked by terrorists?
"Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!"
What did they say??
...Dude...
I...
"Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?"
Let's just get this over with!
God damnit!
Who are you?
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
We just... went on a balloon ride.
...What?
Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
Ah I guess.
"Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there."
"No, no dude, it went up there."
Imagina-eh
"Right, then it was ""Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on"""
Cartman??
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
"Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!"
Stan?
"I didn't ""bail,"" I got picked up by the government!"
"Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-"
"Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!"
"No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it!"
Just get to it already!
"Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!"
Let's just DO IT!
AAAHHH!
AAAAAAAAAAAA-
Stan?
Stan?
"Cartman, what's happened?"
"No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!"
Arh!
"Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!"
"Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?"
"Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on."
Oh for the love of God!
"Stan! Dude, is that you?"
"No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination."
"Dude, what's happening?"
Oh no.
The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
What am I supposed to do?
Stan? Stan??
I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
"No, I don't! The decision was overturned."
"Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!"
"Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke."
"Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!"
Nothing.
Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do!
They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
"No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls"
Huh?
Oh boy...
"Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?"
Aah.
"Yeah, I guess."
Hi Superman.
I know.
Oh God...
"Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore."
You have to stop!
"Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of ""real."" They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us."
"Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!"
"Cartman, don't!"
I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
"Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero."
"Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating."
For reals?
"Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials."
Oh my God!
Do we? He's a legend!
"Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool."
"D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?"
"Oh, okay. Cool."
"Hey dude, how'd it-?"
Who is this?
"Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?"
But it's our game. We bought it together.
Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
I have been sick!
I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points.
I'm not done yet.
No. You're thinking of somebody else.
"Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?"
"Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters."
"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet."
"Thanks, Mick."
What are you doing here?
Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five.
"Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities!"
"Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship!"
"You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore!"
"It was pretty fun, wasn't it?"
"Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway."
I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
"I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself."
"Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?"
"Thanks, Mick!"
Goddammit! God dammit!
"You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time."
"You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?!"
"Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?"
No way.
I'm last? Last?
I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
"Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest."
Oh God! I do?
Ahahah!
"Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!"
Hrrgh!
Hello.
Yeah.
No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
"No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover."
Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on.
They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
Who said that?
Abraham Lincoln?
But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
That should just about do it.
"All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!"
"Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!"
Huh??
"Stan, what is going on?!"
So what number was I??
She's gonna kill us?
I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
Cartman has HIV?
Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
...No. Way.
"...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute."
"I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly."
I do.
I'm sorry. I gotta go home.
Wagh.
What? No?!
What?
"No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch!"
"I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!"
Why do I have HIV?!
What did you do?!
Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?!
Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
AAAAAAA!
Here you go!  Here you go!
He gave me AIDS!
He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
An apology?!
...What?!
A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
I'm going to break everything that you own!
"There is no cure, you asshole!"
What hope?!
You're lying!
Magic Johnson?
So what?!
"You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!"
"Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!"
NO!
Don't. Touch me.
"Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease."
Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
"Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!"
Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
Yes!!
Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
Dude.
You sleep with money. Every night?
"Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe..."
Wugh.
Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
I'm still breaking your Xbox.
A hundred thousand dollars?
Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
"It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera."
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
"Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!"
"We uh, we have special permission?"
We did it guys!
Ahall right!
"All right. Butters, go get next to her."
"All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!"
How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
Whew.
"Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?"
Oh my God!
"Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable."
"Oh, God, what have we done?!"
Dude!
Oh crap!
What?!
"Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?"
"Aw come on now, people!"
"Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?"
"Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station."
Yes they are! I have an idea.
"I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!"
"Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?"
Huh?
What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
NO!
You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
"Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?"
Be a good boy? You know all about this?
"She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!"
Corn harvest!
You can get high from choking yourself?
You guys are wasting your time.
Whoa!
"Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!"
"Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering."
"Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore."
"Guys, have you seen Kenny?"
"Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing."
"Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now."
Kenny?
Kenny!
"Kenny, we need to have a serious talk."
Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese!
We've gotta keep this away from him.
Yeah?
No.
"All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend."
I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
"Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?"
God!
Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it!
What?
"What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!"
"I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?"
Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
I have no idea.
And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life.
Kenny!
Kenny? Kenny?!
"Guys, I'm really worried about my brother."
"You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!"
There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
"Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike."
We totally think you should have more money.
Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
The Internet?
They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
"Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon!"
Excuse me.  Hello?
Wait we're working on it.
"Sir, we're doing everything we can."
We don't want you to die.
"We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?"
"Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn."
"Okay, we did it."
Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you.
Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
"Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!"
"Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!"
"He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!"
"If they give you something small, will you end the strike?"
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
Ike. Ike!  It's over.
Yeah. Here you go.
"Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media."
"You're not the teacher, fatass."
You're not an awesome teacher!
The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
Kenny's!
Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you!
What?
Ih it's not working.
I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
I have to get online before school.
It's not working here?
Where... is... the Internet?
"Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that..."
I think... I know what's wrong.
This is gonna suck.
"I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?"
That guy is wearing a digital watch.
Right. Except for it really isn't.
What's that?
"Come on, this is serious!"
Here! Here's the phone!
What's the number to dial out?
"I got through. Hello, police?"
There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
"Sister, you don't know the half of it."
Why aren't the cops coming in?
Will you shut up!
I don't believe it.
"Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!"
Stan?
"I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this."
"Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore!"
"Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't."
"Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!"
Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
"I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away."
I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can.
No... No!  No...
"No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!"
We can't just leave!
Aw it's horrible!
Somebody do something!
They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him!
Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...
"My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible."
"I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone."
Stan?
I love you too.
Did you see it?
Indy deserved more than that!
"I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel."
It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore.
What?
We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
"No, really. We've always thought you suck."
"I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?"
Girls like shaved balls?
I think Kenny likes it.
Two hundred dollars?
...Become a Peruvian flute band?
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments?
"Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!"
Gracias.
This is awesome!
God damn it!
"Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?"
Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
We just wanna go home.
"Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States."
"No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru!"
"You know I can't go there, Stan!"
That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
"Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here."
Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
And that makes sense to you?
So we've gotta find another way out of here.
Yeah. Stuff just happens.
That's right!
Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
"Hey, hey, look at this."
I don't know. It's old.
"Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries"
"Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band."
"Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened."
That is Craig.
Hear that? It sounds like water.
How do you do that?
Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
"Yeah, what a dick!"
"Dude, have you seen my parents?"
"He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine."
"Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won."
What?!
Oh my God!
"Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it."
Ike?  Oh crap Ike?
Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window.
"Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help."
"Hey, excuse me, but we need some help."
"No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!"
We NEED a ride to the hospital!
"We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay."
"E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention."
"Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help."
What the hell?  Ike?
What's High School Musical 3?
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
I'm not doing it either. Kenny?
I swear
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
Aw man.
"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd."
What? Are you crazy?
"We promised each other we would never do that, remember?"
"Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too."
"Well, I had to see it to believe it!"
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
"Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am."
"Do what you want, don't have restraint."
Where did everybody go?
"Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan?"
"Butters, there's no such things as vampires."
"Yeah, it's just so astounding."
This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
"I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever."
What?!
"Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but..."
"W-well, we've heard that she's..."
Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
What kind of protection?
"Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?"
What's that?
"...Well, what does that mean?"
"Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex."
"Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now."
"Yup, he's in here."
"We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!"
"It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd."
"Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!"
"Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you."
What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
Cartman?
Dow...
We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
"Well, now we know."
"...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway."
"...Dude, what?!"
Why do you care?
"Whoa, what the?"
"Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid."
"Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are."
Who? Me? Why?
Well this sucks!
"You want something new every week, fatass."
My fault?
"Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!"
"Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?"
"Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family"
What's that?
What?
What's going on?
What did he do?
"Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!"
"Come on, this is ridiculous!"
"Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel."
"Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money."
I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
"I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me."
"Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith."
"There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now."
"It's okay, Ma."
Heunh.
"Aww, come on!"
"Come on guys, we gotta go!"
It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
Robbed us of our innocence.
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
"We know, Cartman!"
"Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?"
"Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers."
"I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!"
What?
"Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!"
"No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say ""Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"""
"Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing."
"You know what, Cartman? I believe you."
"Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags!"
"Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia."
"No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket."
"Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life."
"Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know..."
Please. Please let him go.
"Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?"
Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
"Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here."
I'll call you back.
What? Are you sure?
"""Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-"" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!"
Oh God. What have I done?
"No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe."
I know! I was lying then!
"This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!"
"Cartman, knock it off!"
They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
"Ike! Ike, what?!"
"Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities."
"I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name ""Billy Mays"" over and over again."
What?
What?! Are you serious?!
"Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!"
"NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!"
What was what?
Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
"It's all just in your head, Ike."
I just... don't understand it.
"But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?"
"But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?"
Purgatory? What's that?
What?
"Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory."
"Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems."
"Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother."
Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
Comoe back here!
Hey! Heeey!
"Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!"
What the hell are we going to do??
"Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?"
So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
"And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?"
What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
"Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants?"
"Go on by, Michael."
Aww crap!
We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!
"Aw dide, this is hopeless!"
So what?!
Yeah!
"Ike!  Ike, you're back!"
"It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay."
So what?
"Butters, I think you should reconsider this."
"Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special."
Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
"You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp!"
"Butters, I really think we should talk."
"Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong."
"Butters, what's happened to you?"
Wrestling is awesome!
"Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this."
"Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?"
Cool!
Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
"I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!"
"Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!"
"Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!"
"If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?"
"Irene, no! Why?"
Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
Let's do this! One! Two!
So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
What dude?
This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers.
Oh my God... Oh my God...
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
"I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone."
"I'll fight anytime, anywhere!"
"Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown."
What are you talking about?
What?
"Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them."
So what do we do?
How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
He's here! Vince McMahon is here!
You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
Wait a minute. Who is that?
"You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!"
What?
Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
"Dude, they've been doing that for a long time."
"What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are."
Hello? Stan?
This... is exactly what I needed.
Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
"Oh, what the hell?!"
Yes.
Sounds good.
Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
"W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town."
We aren't talking about gay people.
"Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag."
Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
"We're sorry, Mayor."
We gotta run!
Yeah. You definitely made your point.
I don't either.
"Yeah! We did it, you guys!"
Will somebody shut him up?
"Oh God, no!"
"""These, are the morning announcements."""
"Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want."
"All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?"
You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
"Okay, go ahead."
"I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?"
"All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!"
"No dude, Butters' pee is in there."
No they don't!
Dude!
NO!
I'm not getting back in the water.
"Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?"
Do you pee in the pool?
"Aw, come on!"
Most likely.
So what?
"Well then they're not minorities, are they?"
"Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!"
"No, you're the minority!"
"Blow it out your ass, Cartman!"
Eewww!
Aaaaah! Gross!
"Aw, sick!"
Aahhh...
No way!
"Dude, that's all pee!"
I'll die if I do swim in it!
Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
...What?!
You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
That is gross!!
"Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh,"
"Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?"
"Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!"
No.
Not in pee!
Oh who pees in the shower?
"You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!"
Jesus Christ!
Let's just get this over with!
Yes.
What?!
Why?!
"I am not, not, d-rinking pee!"
That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
No!
I'm thinking about it!
"Gah, ah.  Gaagh."
Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH!
Are you fucking kidding me?!
"That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!"
Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
"Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!"
What the hell for?!
AAAAAAAA!
"Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool."
"Jesus, dude."
"I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?"
What?!
"Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?"
So what happens to us now?
"Oh God, it's true."
"Butters! Butters, stop it!"
"Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!"
"No! Butters, stop!"
"Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!"
Hello?
"Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet."
"Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions."
"Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease."
"Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?"
...As soon as what's dead?
I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
What?
What bastard?
I guess it... feels great. Thanks.
"Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?"
"No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is."
I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing.
Why the hell was this book banned?!
"Dude, some people really do consider this obscene."
"Yeah, sweet."
The Tale of...
"Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one..."
"Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!"
What?
"Yeah, we wrote that!"
"No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters."
"Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!"
"Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-"
The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
Yes!
I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
What?!
"Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker!"
"Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!"
Butters wrote a second book!
We can get people to believe us now!
A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
"Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning."
"Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!"
So where's the KFC now?
...so no KFC?
How the hell do you have more friends than me?
"How many friends do you have, Kenny?"
What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
"Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it."
"Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page."
"Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!"
"Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend."
There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
"I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit!"
Can I come in?
I... don't... have... any... friends...
"I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now."
"'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?"
Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!
"'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up..."
"Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!"
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
"I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad."
I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
No. What's chatroulette?
"Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool."
"Aww, that's some dude jacking off!"
That's just a guy's penis too!
"Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!"
"Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!"
"That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends!"
"Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?"
Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
"Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. ""Hey Kyle, really like your farm."" Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan?"
...What?
"Dude, w-what are you doing?"
Profile status?
"Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late."
Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
Café World.
"An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!"
"Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's."
What? Why?
"Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him."
"Unh, that does it!"
"I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy."
"You should know, fatass."
Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
"Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything."
"Dude, what did you do?"
"Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again."
"Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?"
K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
Aww come on! This is ridiculous!
"A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?"
There doesn't have to be...
But Muhammad can't be seen dad.
What kind of extremists are these?
We can't give him over to the gingers!
Aw crap.
"Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here."
Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
"I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on!"
"Come on, Muhammad, the door is open."
"Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand."
"Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!"
"Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!"
"Oh, you are not doing that again!"
Stop talking with your stupid hand!
Dude!
We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
"That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works."
"Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear."
"Wwait, what?"
"Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!"
You gotta be kidding me!
"Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up."
"If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im."
"When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything."
"Please, sir."
"Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men."
If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
"We're here for Towelie, fatass!"
"This is serious, you fucking asshole!"
But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
Oh my God!
"Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on."
"""What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up""?"
"Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself."
What?!
"Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!"
How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
"I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!"
"Mom, Dad, what's ""muff cabbage""?"
"The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop ""muff cabbage""."
She said they're from New Jersey.
Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
"Know what, Ma?"
Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
Where the hell are they coming from?!
"Hey, dudes."
What are you talking about?
So what?
"No, it doesn't!"
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
What's strike three?!
Shut the fuck up!  What?
Why does it matter?!
"No, it isn't!"
"No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God."
"Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now."
"Not now, Mom. Please."
"All right, all right."
"What am I, Mom?"
What are you saying?!
No! I don't wanna look like this!
I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!
"I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!"
That's enough!
"Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in!"
Why?
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
"All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?"
"No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?"
"Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!"
Agggh! Agggh!  No!
"Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!"
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff!
"Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel."
"It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing."
What's it say?
Dude. What's wrong with you?
Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
"But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with."
How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy?
Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
"We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?"
"He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay."
He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
"Let's hear it, Cartman!"
Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
"Just let us see your iPad, Cartman."
"So, plug it in."
"You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone."
"Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y-"
What? Ready for what?
"What ""agreement""?!"
Hey! You can't do that!
What are you talking about?!
The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!
You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
"It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!"
"I don't know, I didn't read them!"
Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
"You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?"
"Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right?"
Gahhh!
"Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!"
"Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!"
But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
AAHH!
Dad! You tasered my dad!
What is this? What's going on?
...What?
"Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!"
We didn't read them!
The first what?
(I need some help! I can't take it!)
(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
(Yes! Please! Let me go!)
(You're fine!)
(Yaaaaah!)
(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!)
(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
(NOOOO!)
"(Yes. Yes, hurry up.)"
"(Oh, shit!)"
(Yes. I promise I'll read.)
"Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea."
"Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either."
A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
"Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!"
"Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this."
"Butters! Butters, is everything okay?"
"Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!"
"I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs."
"Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!"
Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?
"Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out."
It's working!
"No problem, Funnybot."
"Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?"
...I don't know.
"Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?"
I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
I'm just doing the line.
"Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am."
"Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?"
"I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada."
"Hmmm, yeah."
"...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened."
"You get in trouble again, Cartman?"
No they didn't.
That doesn't make any sense.
How big do they say mine is?
Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
Didn't you forget something?
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
Thirteen point seven inches?
Your wiener is not 13 inches long!
"Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!"
I'm so happy!
Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
"Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch!"
Why do they have to put this on TV?!
"Aaaggh, God."
"I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude!"
What exactly can I do to help?
"Oh it's, it's so sad."
What are you doing here?
...What are you doing here?!
Why do you have a video camera?
"I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?"
Thanks.
What's going on?!
So what are you doing?!
"Alright, what is it?!"
Why do you need me?
I knew you were doing something terrible!
Lots of people will when I tell them!
You what?
A thousand dollars.
There's a big wait to sit down.
Jesus Christ.
Wow...
"And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side."
"Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest."
"I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff."
Crack baby... basketball.
"No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?"
"Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that?"
"Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!"
"I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya."
I need to talk to you.
In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
Gut they're the ones risking injury.
"The government could come after us, Cartman."
So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
A hot tub?!
Gravy?
No way.
"I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal."
What other companies?
"Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!"
It happens to be called poutine in Montreal!
"Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies."
"I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!"
...What?
"And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?"
What?
"Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!"
Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
"You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!"
"It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!"
"This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?"
But who paid for all this?
You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.
Oh God...
"Here, this one's from me, Stan."
Yeah dude!
Yeah they're the best!
But that's our music! We like it!
Gross!
"Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this!"
Hey Stan.
"Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite."
Sure.  What's up?
Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.
Why? What's it sound like?
"What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?"
No.
"NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor."
"Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?"
"Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?"
What's that?
"Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire."
"Yeah, we got him!"
We're gonna level up to detective!
"Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?"
You don't wanna eat it?
"Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?"
"Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?"
I know! That's so hilarious!
"No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-"
"Alright dude, we were going to the movies."
"Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is ""that looks like shit"" and, and ""this is shitty!"""
"Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time."
Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.
"Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!"
"Shhh, you're doing it again!"
"No, they're penguins! Stop it!"
"That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you!"
"Dude, you've... you've changed."
"No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo-"
Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
"That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!"
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
That's what they're talking about on the news!
Yes!
You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!
"I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse."
"I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything."
"NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude."
What's the matter dude?
"You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman."
Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.
"Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!"
"About three minutes, fatass!"
"Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?"
Stan?
"Hey, Stan!"
"Stan, are you alright?"
"Really? Uh, Stan, that's great."
Dude. Have you been drinking?
"It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now."
See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
"Yeah, it's fine."
"Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there."
"Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn."
"There, ten mediums and five medium-rares."
"Next please.  Oh, hey."
What are you doing?
I don't know.
Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
"Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!"
"You said ""fuck you"" to my face, Stan."
"Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us."
"You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!"
"Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!"
"Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them."
Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
Better than being a fatass Texan!
"No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!"
So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
Butters?
"Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead."
"Wugh, game on."
"Cartman, what the hell is this?!"
"""Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol""?! ""Permission to shoot on sight""?!"
Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
"Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!"
"Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco."
The blond kid?
How do you know?!
What's that?
"Dude, that's so wrong!"
What's up?
"Dude, that's fucked up."
It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
That's not funny.
I'm not looking at that!
It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
"So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?"
Where is it coming from?
If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
One.  Two. Three!
Get it!
Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.
What?
What is that thing?
Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!
Here's a shoebox!
Grab him!
What the hell happened?!
"Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes."
Four weeks we gotta do this?
"Shut the hell up, Cartman!"
How do you murder a stuffed animal?!
"Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?"
"Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire."
"It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!"
We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
"Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over."
"Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!"
How is that gonna help?!
What? This isn't history.
What??
We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
Dude!
"Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!"
"Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!"
"Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel."
We saw it on your channel.
You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them.
...Uh oh.
I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
Ack dude!
"Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!"
Would you guys stop!
"No, ah I don't."
I actually only just said that sarcastically.
"But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them."
I'm not a professor.
You are the fucking History Channel!
"So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?"
"Wow, awesome. Um..."
"Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that."
Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?
"Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd"
"You know, could youuu..."
Would you please just open your wormhole?!
Errh!
"Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all."
I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand.
"Oh, come on!!"
"Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious."
That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
"My name. Is not. ""Kyel."""
I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
"How was jail, fatass?!"
Is your mom always like that dude?
"Cartman, it was actually really lame."
"I know, fatass. I was there."
That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all.
What's going on?
From what?
"Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener."
So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
"All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet."
"Aw, he's dead?"
You hear that Clyde?
Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
What?
That... was six grand?
"Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says ""Cash For Gold and Jewelry."" There must be a lot of people doin' it."
"Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!"
Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
"Dude, that's terrible!"
That's the chemical equation for gold?
"...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?"
Yeah!
What does that mean?
"Nuh uh! It's ""Whoever denied it, supplied it!"""
"We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!"
What's he doing?
"Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?"
"Alright, Butters. Bring it in."
"Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman."
Go Cartman!
"So, what do you want to do now?"
"You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?"
How can that be? Already?
How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
"Yep, that's great."
"Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?"
"W-what's the matter, Kenny?"
"Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?"
"We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?"
Benedict Arnold.
Kenny?
You guys are sellouts.
You're freaking sellouts!
"Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there."
"Yeah, good idea."
"We have to face it, Cartman."
I really thought it was gonna last.
It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
I-It's good that it became something else.
"Yeah, that's awesome."
"What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting."
It's super awesome.
"Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango."
"Two, one. Go Cartman!"
"Cartman? Go, Cartman."
"Yeah. Do it, Cartman."
Get out of here.
Get. Outta here!
What are you gonna do?
No?
What does that have to do with Passover?
"Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies."
I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
"If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!"
Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
"These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid."
What are you doing?
"Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go."
Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
"That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!"
It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
That's just how God is.
This is what God told us to do!
You'll see!
Yeah.
"I know, you're not."
"Happy Passover, Cartman."
"Where's your lunch, Butters?"
"Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters."
"Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?"
Pansy.
"He doesn't wanna do it, dude."
"Why are you doing this, Stan?"
You're gonna stop bullying.
With Cartman singing about his vagina.
"Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!"
Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego.
"Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!"
I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God.
Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!
What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
"Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them."
"If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!"
"If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!"
"Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help!"
AAAAAAAH! I can't take it!
We were stuck. We were completely stuck.
We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
"And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining."
We've definitely not done that before!
Cool! Ziplining.
"And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."""
"So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late."
We don't mind.
Jesus Christ!
"How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?"
"Dude, did you fart?!"
"Well? How was it, Cartman?"
Zipline.
"It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster."
"E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?"
STOP!
Wugh!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us!
Me?!
"Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!"
You fat piece of shit!
DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
"The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!"
You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
"Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true."
"Oh, thank God!"
AAAAH!
Can we please go faster?!
AAAAAAAAAAH!
Just go. Go without me.
"I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say ""long story short""? They're not making it short, Stan."
What's the point?
Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
"Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!"
Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!
"I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it."
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!"
"IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!"
"So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!"
You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
"You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan!"
"How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one."
Mr. Hankey!
"Just tell us, Butters."
Will you shut the hell up?!
"Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!"
"Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?"
Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
"Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!"
"Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya!"
"It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately."
You motherfucker!
What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
"The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!"
"Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!"
What?!
Who is Cupid Me?!
You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
God-damnit!
Hey man. You okay?
What happened? It just didn't work out?
"So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?"
"So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?"
"Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?"
"Huh?  Dude, what the fuck?"
That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together!
We don't have kickoffs anymore.
This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
We don't even understand how this game is played.
"Dude, what do you mean ""We don't have a coach.""?"
But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
We can't.
"We need you, Butters. You're the man!"
"Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat."
"Right, you're not fat."
"Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy?"
Why do they even allow those things in stored?
You've gotta be kidding me!
"Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year!"
Why?
"Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-"
Oh no!
You don't need that! Get off of it.
"That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!"
What??
So take a shit somewhere else!
You have got to be kidding me!
We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
Who's Honey Boo Boo?
"Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore."
"Come on, hurry it up in there!"
This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
"Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?"
"You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right."
"Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue."
Fatty Doo Doo?
What?
What have you done?
"When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!"
"You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??"
"When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?"
"I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?"
"Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo."
What?
What? Oh my God.
"I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger."
You found a network to buy it?
"I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan."
Huh?
I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
"Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?"
"I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-"
Oh no...
"You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do."
Take a look.
Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
Yeah dude.
"Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time."
I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
What?
It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
I know...
What?!
"Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!"
"The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!"
"Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet."
"And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself."
"Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?"
"Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?"
"You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!"
"Dude, come down here!"
"Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?"
Butters?  Why?
"Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-"
What?
"Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him."
"Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him."
"Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?"
But what about the costume contest?!
Stan can't come.
Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
"Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?"
"Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea."
"All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?"
He looks fine.
"We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-"
Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!
"Oh, sorry dude."
For Odin! For Asgard!
Oh my God!
"And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend."
Stan!
What happened to you?
"Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!"
Stan?
The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
Did you do it?
What are you people talking about?
"Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you."
You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
Because you kind of made it matter.
S-so you did superglue it.
"Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this."
Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
"Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?"
"Nothing, watching the election results."
What?!
"Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!"
It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
Sure you do!
"Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election?"
What the hell is this?
I don't believe it.
Why do you have these?
Dude!
"Knock it off, Cartman!"
"You're not getting away with this, you fat turd!"
"This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it."
Upstairs! First door to the left!
But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
"Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!"
Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
"Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter."
"God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!"
"Butters, you know something, don't you?!"
What did Cartman tell you?!
Tell us what you know right now!
Then you have to tell us!
Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it!
Can we please just try and talk to him?
"Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!"
"I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!"
Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
"What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!"
Where?
What?
"All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?"
"Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!"
"Anything in the basement, Jimmy?"
Well keep looking.
"Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him."
"We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-"
"Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken."
What?
I... what?
It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
"It matters, Stan. It it matters."
Oh my God.
Look! There they are!
"We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us!"
No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
Protect it?
Well... if you put it that way...
"I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!"
AAAARGH!
That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
Then take that shit off speaker phone!!
How do we have a choice?!
Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
What the hell are you doing?!
You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
"Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!"
"Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know."
What? How do you know?
That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. 
"Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!"
You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
Corey Lanskin?
We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
"Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house."
So you know it.
"We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft."
"Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please."
Can we talk to your supervisor please?!
You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
"Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!"
He's doing it a-gain.
"Yeah, that sucked."
You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
You're a murderer.
"Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me."
"I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head."
"Hey Ike, how's it going?"
I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
"Ike, I just want us to be friends again."
"Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times."
It always has been. See? This is nice. 
What?
"Ike, is that chewing tobacco?"
"No, I just don't think it's healthy."
"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?"
No.
It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
Right now.
I don't know.
What?
"He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex."
"Yeah, he just seems so young."
"Let's just give it a chance, Ike."
What the fuck is going on?!
"I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!"
He doesn't even let me near him!
What??
"Oh, thanks! "
I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
Hey Ike.
"Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live."
"I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike."
"Ike, I do! I just-"
Ike no! Stop!
We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
That's what I thought.
"Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing."
"I'm your big brother, Ike! "
"I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling-"
Hey!
"Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!"
What?
"No, this is his brother."
Satisfied with-  Wait a minute. What medication?!
"Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!"
"Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!"
You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
"I dunno!  Try ""strangetamer."""
Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
"Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!"
Ike!  Wait! '
"Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand."
"Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!"
"Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it."
Ike?
"It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?"
"Yeah, I bet she does."
About what?!
"Alright, Cartman, joke's over."
Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
Huh?
Nothing.
Wuwhat's going on?
I don't speak Hebrew.
He said they come on urgent business.
"The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!"
It's right over here by uh-
He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!
Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
"Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!"
NOOOO!
Yeah.
No shit!
Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
"Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!"
"Dude, go to Hell!"
Wwwait.
Mom?
"Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you."
"You're a fat skank, Mom."
"You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue."
I just... thought it'd be nice.
Yes sir.
Yes.  I love Cartman's farts.
Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
Yummy yummy thank you Cartman.
"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?"
"If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?"
Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.
Because they taste so yummy.
Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
Please...
Yummy yummy.
Hey
"I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled."
"I just do, Stan."
Yes.
Yes.
NO.
This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?
I don't care.
That's fine.
"Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be."
"No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more."
Huh? Who...? Who is that?
I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
I... I know.
"That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking."
Yes.
I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
Yes! Yes I will!
"Yes, whatever you want."
"It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you."
"Hello, Stan."
There are greater things at work than what you understand.
I'm actually the complete opposite.
"I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place."
I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
"All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!"
Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
Dude! Do not do this!
"Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!"
"I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!"
"I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!"
"Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry, Kenny!"
Hurray!
"Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!"
Yes! It did!
"But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!"
But it's the truth!
Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
Larry and Brad Stoltsky
Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
Yeah.
"Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system."
"If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine."
"No, the XBox's are gonna be better."
"No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?"
"Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One."
Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
I know.
I don't know.
"This isn't helping us, Butters!"
"Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?"
"Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances."
"It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday."
Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
"If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong."
Grounded? For what?
"No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!"
What?
"Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control."
All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
"Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!"
This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
"Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!"
"I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have."
"Go ahead and tell him, Cartman."
"Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers."
"Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there."
"Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too."
"I swear, Stan."
"Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!"
Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
What the hell did you do??
No. Tell me you didn't!
"Thanks, Mrs. Marsh."
Ok-okay.  Stan? Stan?
"Stan, it's me."
"Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us."
"You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair."
You didn't?
"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine."
"Stan, don't say that."
"Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! "
"I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!"
"I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!"
"The fight is over, Cartman!"
Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
Stan?
"Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?"
Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
"Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together."
"Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship."
Yes! 
Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
"Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!"
Well what are you watching?
You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
"Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?"
"Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days."
"Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame."
"Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!"
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary."
"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! "
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it."
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
"Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?"
"Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!"
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
What the fuck?!
"Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!"
But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
What do you think you're doing?!
You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
Let's Plays?
You're not gonna believe this.
"I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition."
Come on! 
See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
"This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!"
It's dying. The living room is... dying.
I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
"You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV."
Do you mind?!
Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
"What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-"
It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
"Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!"
THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
Barking vaginal belch.
Bloody butt cough.
How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
"Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company."
What?! Tell us!
Washington Redskins?
What?!
"Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal."
"Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original"
"Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for."
I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
No way!
"Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them."
People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
That's the Catholic Church!
That's the NFL!
"All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking."
Maybe I'll start my own company.
I don't want to! It's a stupid name!
Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
"It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!"
"You okay, bro?"
"Give it time, it'll grow on you."
"Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!"
Well whattaya mean?
"Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table"" is holding you back."
Yeah. Good luck with yours.
"What the hell is wrong? ""Can't find the server"" Kickstarter."
What?!
"No, I just can't get it to load."
My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
He's right. We should do a merger.
"Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it."
"Whattaya say, Cartman?"
"When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%."
What the heck is that?
Change our name?
When was that?
Well what the hell do we do?
Hey guys!
"Sup, Jason?"
"Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out."
We were- trying to be funny.
"Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore?"
"Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school."
I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
"Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever."
"Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us."
"No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go."
"A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?"
"Yeah, it's going to be this weekend."
"Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!"
Hey Cartman.
"Dude, calm down."
Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
"Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up."
"That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?"
"Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up."
"We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!"
"Jesus Christ, dude."
Cartman?
"Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man."
"We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us."
"Are you okay, Cartman?"
"Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!"
"Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore."
"That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it."
Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
That's terrible!
Are you happy now?!
"Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?"
"See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!"
"I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-"
I was in the bathroom-
"No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!"
How is that spying?!
Hey Jimmy. What's up?
Oh. Really?
"Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out."
What?
This is stupid!
It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
Who makes this crap?
You... missed school today?
Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
"Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?"
"Kenny, who told you about this game?"
"Dude, what?!"
"Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?"
"Dude, what are you doing?!"
You need to stop recommending that app to people!
"Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!"
You just push it on other people?!
"Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!"
But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
You have your crutches!
You're saging these games do this on purpose?!
"Sure. Come on, guys. "
"We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-"
"Wuh, what's done?"
Hey dude.
Y-you alright?
"Coup de grah, Cartman"
"Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!"
"You should probably listen to him, dude."
Maybe we are.
Hello?
Again?
Uh huh.
"Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now."
You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
Fuck you!
"Get up, Cartman!"
"Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!"
Fuck you if you're in on this.
"Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service."
"Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset."
Kyle.
I don't care!
You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
Fuck you!
He said they're doing a Total Recall.
You haven't done anything yet!
We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
"Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you."
"Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible."
"Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here."
"Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here."
"I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me."
Www-what do you mean?
Fuck you!
Don't... do that!
"NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-"
No. Then I came into this virtual space.
Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
"Or if you sold one to an ""Eric Cartman""?"
Dude... What?
"Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?"
"Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-"
Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
God damn it Cartman!
He's lying.
Why not?
Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
"Alright, dude, take off the headset. "
"Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?"
But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
Can Kenny block his elderbeast?
He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
You've never seen anything so ruthless!
"Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok."
It doesn't even look like they're open.
It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
"Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally."
"Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!"
You were?
"Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything."
We don't... really know the difference.
Then he's perfect for us.
Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
"You can do it, McNuggets!"
All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
You mean there's more to this?
It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
"Yeah, you gotta know people."
This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
"Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude."
"Come on, Kenny!"
He just had to shuffle it.
"Holy shit, dude!"
"Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened."
"Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?"
Got what?
"It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube."
"Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-"
I'm NOT a GRANDPA!
"But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom"
Whattaya think?
Really??
"Hm, I wasn't really going for ""gay,"" I was more going for ""wholesome."""
"But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values."
Bill Cosby.
Is here. To see me.
Hello.
We?
Wow.  Well that's awesome!
"M-Ah, I'd love to."
Uh okay! No problem! 
"Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!"
"Dude, what are you doing?!"
"They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!"
"These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!"
"No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!"
"Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room."
That son of a bitch!
Why would he do this?!
"Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!"
Mom?! Where is Ike?!
That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
"Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!"
WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!
"Cartman, open this door right now!"
What the hell are you doing?!
Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
"Because you just said, ""here in my room""!"
"What are you talking about, Stan?"
"Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped."
I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
"Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad."
How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
I am so confused.
"Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again."
Help? How can you help?
Really? That's what you guys would do?
"Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!"
You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear!
PewDiePie?!
"Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night."
"Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats."
"No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here.  And I, think that's great."
"Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again."
"Ike, you can't come to school with me."
"Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!"
"Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!"
"Well, what?"
"Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!"
Kick the baby.
Really? What about?
Totally!
"Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows."
"Yeah, fat boy saw it!"
What's an anal probe?
Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
Why are you walkin' so funny Cartman?
"No, Ike, go home."
This is it. This one's for the game.
Kick the baby!
"Damn it, he's still there."
"No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me."
Ike! Go home!
"Oh, my God!"
"Ike!  Stop the bus! Miss Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!"
But I have to get off!
No.
But I...
Arrghh!
"I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!"
What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted.
"Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, ""Where's your brother, Kyle?"" ""You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"""
"""You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!"" ""Brush and floss, Kyle!"" ""Where has that finger been, Kyle?"""
"Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now."
"No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens.  It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe."
"Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?"
"I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!"
"Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?"
Damn it!
Dude!
"Dude, he's farting fire!"
"Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger."
"Dude, what does the note say?"
Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
"Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back."
Bad.
"Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?"
No!
Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
That was cool!
"Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me."
"Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?"
He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
Hey!
If you visitors can hear me-
"-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!"
Give me back my brother!
"You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!"
"Now do you believe us, Cartman?"
"Cartman, they killed Kenny!"
"He's dead, Cartman!"
"Go on and go home, you fat chicken!"
"You're all I have left, Stan."
"You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude!"
Rats.
"Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now."
"You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do."
"Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?"
Just make sweet love down by the fire.
...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
Why?
"Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman."
"Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop."
How come the visitors aren't coming for him?
"Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!"
Sure you do!
"Fart, damn you!"
"Whoa, look at that."
"Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh..."
"Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing."
"Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again."
Did it work?
"Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!"
You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
"Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!"
"Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!"
Ike!
Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
"Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike."
"Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner."
"Yeh, we're running out of friends."
"Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school."
"Cartman, you do have pinkeye!"
"Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?"
Nobody hates rainbows.
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
"No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?"
"Wow, what did you write about Cartman?"
What was your paper about Wendy?
Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?
"Wow, are you gonna do it?"
"What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?"
"Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's."
"Bulk up to what, fatass?"
"Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load."
"You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!"
"Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go ""God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"""
I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
Stop who?
"Uh oh, we're losing him."
"Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!"
"Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play."
"Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway."
"Ready to go hunting, Cartman?"
Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
I like chocolate milk.
"Wow, that'd be cool."
What do you mean?
I guess so.
What?!
Shoot it Stan.
"Hey, what's that?"
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!
"No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee."
"Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!"
Deformed how?
A knife.
"Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!"
"Yeah, give me that flashlight."
What is that?
"Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand."
"Stan, Stan, wake up!"
I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
They're out fishing with Kenny.
"Well Stan, you want to know what I think?"
Look!
"Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying."
"Look, up there."
"Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it."
Whoa!
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
Oh my God! Look at his leg!
Aaaaah!
"Hey look, Kenny's okay."
"Yeah, make up your mind, dude!"
"Dude, I don't understand hunting at all."
"Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice."
Who's that?
Wow! Cool!
"You're on, dude."
I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
Who's Middle Park?
"Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?"
You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
Did it work?
Oolala
Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
"Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else."
What'd he say?
"Come on dude, we have to get to practice."
"Uh, Chef?"
Chef.
Chef!
What's the matter dude?
"Wow, it's been like two days."
We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.
You what?!
But I never practiced quarterback.
"Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!"
"Set, set.  Damn it Cartman!"
Cartman farted!
No way dude!
"Ah, dude, weak."
Hut.
"Hut, hut."
"Wha-? Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You Bastards!"
Hike!
"Hey Stan, Ah- I'm open, I think."
Oof.
"Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan."
You mean this one?
He's my new pet elephant.
"I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three."
"No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch."
"Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid."
"Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya."
Mr. Garrison?
"With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?"
"That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs."
"Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want."
I'll bet you can't.
Genetic Engineering Ranch!  Sweet!
We can use Cartman's pig.
"We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood."
Ready to go Stan?
To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
This must be it.
"No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together."
It's just a stupid pig.
"What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!"
"There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!"
Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
"No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets."
How does that make the world better?
"Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?"
Which song is that?
"Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?"
Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy.
"Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!"
No! We're already halfway done.
It's more than you've got!
Oh my God! They cloned a foot.
Hey Chef.
"We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice."
I told you guys.
You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!
"We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk."
"Yeah Stan, she's just a girl."
"Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, ""Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."""
"Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig."
Come on Kenny.
"Come on elephant, keep drinking."
Dammit! This is never gonna work.
"Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex."
Hey look!  It's working.
Aah!
Aren't they ever gonna wake up?
I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
"Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?"
Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
Is he bigger than a regular clone?
How big do you think he is?
"Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?"
"Come on, let's go!"
"Wait, Stan, there he goes."
He recognizes you dude.
What should we do with him?
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!"
"Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya."
"Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now."
"Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?"
"Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip."
But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
Ow! What the hell was that for?!
Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
"Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna."
"Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all."
But won't your grampa be there?
"Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?"
"I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance."
"Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?"
"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
"Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever."
What are they doing in there?
"Yep, all done."
"Yeah, stupid!"
"Well, it, it looks like..."
Why is Death coming after us?
What are we gonna do?
"Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids."
Good point man.
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!"
"Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?"
"Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?"
You bastards!
It looks like a UFO.
"Dude, it can't be cooler than mine."
"Ha ha, you look like a pansy."
"What uh, what are you supposed to be?"
Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
Wow! Cool!
Cartman! What kind of costume is that?
No it's not cool!
Hehe. Sissy.
You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.
"Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?"
Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous...
Everyone came as Chewbacca?!
Dammit!
"Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!"
Wookies don't live on Endor!
Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
Aren't you hungry Kenny?
"Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal."
Check this out!
I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
"Dude, I thought she was dead."
"What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers!"
Hey dudes.
Check.
What's that?
You still didn't get a costume Kenny?
"Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains."
If everyone is turned into zombies...
"Chef, you've gotta help us!"
"Yeah, I'm scared."
I found it! I found it!
"See Cartman, your mom is on the cover."
Chef!!!
But the zombies are coming!
There's a bunch of zombies here!
"Uh, okay. Then what?"
"Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!"
"Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary."
Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
It's working! They're turning back to normal.
"Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us."
"...No, dude, that's Christmas."
Costumes and candy.
"We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom."
Yeah!
"Oh, cool."
"Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House."
"Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman."
Did they say if it's waterproof?
What did she say?
Ass-raper.
Ask her if we get the watch right away.
I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
"Hey, look you guys."
The digital sports watch is here.
"Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians."
Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.
What's your name dude?
Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
"Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother."
"Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me."
Totally.
We do!
"This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin."
"Yeah, that one."
"Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude."
But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
Because why?
Then you take care of him.
You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
"I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin?"
Here you go turkeys!
You bastards!
"Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman."
Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
"Come on, Mary!  Push!"
I can see its head!
It's a boy!
...Sorry
"Shut up, fat boy!"
I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...
"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-"
"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?"
"We can, too!"
Officer Barbrady!
Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
Damnit!
No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.
"Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo."
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
"Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!"
"It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas"
"What's going on, you guys?"
"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
"Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?"
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
"It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-"
Wait...
"But dad, he always sh..."
There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.
I said Ike's on fire!
It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!
I'm not hearing that.
Mr. Hankey?
"Go away, Mr. Hankey."
I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.
Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.
Nothing.
"Mr. Hankey, come here."
"Say something, Mr. Hankey!"
Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?
"Nobody believes in you, not even my friends."
"Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends."
Yeah!  We'll show them!
"Hello, everybodyyy."
It's a surprise.
O-Okay.  But don't scare him...
Wait! You guys!  He's alive!
"Come on, dance!  Daaance!  Dance, damn you!!"
"Shut up, Cartman!"
"I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
"Shut up, Cartman!"
Mr. Hankey.
"Mr. Hankey, no!"
Uuuuuuhh...
I don't have a problem.
What's that?
Mookie-stinks?
"Wull, not on purpose."
"Well, sometimes..."
Well sure.
"No, dude!"
But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...
Here.  Just look more closely at it.
I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.
No.
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma..."
"I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew..."
"Oh no, I'm not sane yet!"
Friends?
You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy?
"Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right."
"What is this, Cartman?"
"Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever."
"Damn, what a freak!"
Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
"Yeah, that's weak!"
"You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table!"
Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
Bad.
"Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak."
The new kid.
"We told you, dude."
"Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny."
Yeah.
... K.
"Ohh, dude!"
We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
"Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?"
Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.
See ya.
We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
"Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?"
"Yeah, you have to hit him."
"Hey, you just got here, Chef!"
"And neither were you, Pip!"
Wow!
"Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien."
"It's a game, dude. It's really fun."
Aaaaa!
They were all out of 'em dude!
Aaaaaaaa!
"Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you."
Uuuuh. Stan?
Stan.
Stan!
"Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second."
"Yeah, dude!"
Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Hmmm.
You bastard!
Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
"Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!"
"Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!"
"Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful!"
Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents.
My laundry detergent?
Yup!
"Stop kissing ass, Cartman!"
"Where's your present, Cartman?"
Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
"No, she wasn't!"
Oh cool.
"Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy."
How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
A plebeian?
"Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?"
"Hey, yeah!"
"Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fatass."
Really?
And I got these killer Birken-stocks.
"Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!"
Yeah!
So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Down by the fire?
You bastard!
"Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!"
"I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange."
How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
Wendy! You didn't!
"Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it."
I don't know.
That was cool!
"You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now."
"No way, fatty, it's mine!"
"You threw it away, fatso!"
"Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'"
"You liar, Cartman!"
"I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it."
What would we use a marble sack for?
I didn't steal anything.
Good!
Whoa!
No.
Aagh! Stop that!
Yyeeaahh.
"You threw it away, Cartman!"
Yeah. How'd you know?
Triangle of Zinthar?
AAAAAA!
Cartman?
What the hell are you doing?!
"Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!"
"Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!"
"If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!"
Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
Your triangle?
"Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45."
Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?
"Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!"
Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!
"Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?"
"Whoa, that was cool!"
You bastard!
The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.
"No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr!"
Disintegration is the best album everrr!
We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted!
"Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?!"
"Well, that whole experience sure did suck."
"But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead."
Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
Yeah.
"Whoa, dude."
"Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school."
Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
Really?
"Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman."
Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
Woo-whataya mean?
How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
"Yeah, dude. It looks riveting."
Hunh?
Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
"Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video."
Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
"If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs."
"You live on the Eastside, Cartman!"
You bastards!
"Yeah, with butterscotch."
Woohoo!
"We're gonna win $10,000!"
I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
"Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000."
They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!
You bastards!
Dammit!
"Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test."
"Dad, how could you?!"
You bastards!
He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
"Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads."
"Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman."
Really?
I'm sailing away
Set an open course for the virgin sea...
"Whoa, dude!"
"Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad."
"Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!"
Stan!
"Hey, Cartman."
I'm sailing ay...
I don't know if that's gonna be too easy.
Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
D'you have any wire here?
"No, he'll die!"
You bastard!
He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
I don't know. Let's find out.
Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
"Wow, these books look cool!"
Who are you?
"Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical."
It looks like a note.
Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
"Whoa, dude, what's going on?"
How about a brain transplant?
"Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?"
Oh no!
What's it say?
"Here, give me that.  ""I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."""
"Here! Here, I found one!"
"It says, ""Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--"" What's this word?"
"How's it goin', dude?"
Just read the sentence.
"Come on, dumbass, you can do it!"
"Yeah, maybe you read it wrong."
He's here!
"Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!"
So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
Cartman!
"Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens."
"Whoa, dude!"
"I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?"
Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
It's poetic justice.
"We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
"Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?"
"No, it's his bris."
"I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band."
Uhhh... I'm not sure.
Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
How's it going?
Why bad?
"Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits."
No.
"Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?"
"No, not ham, you fat fuck!"
Your heart?
"Hey, wait!"
Stop who?
What?
Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad!
Mom! Dad!
"Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?"
Meaning what?
AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!
I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
"I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back."
"Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike!"
"Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?"
"You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?"
I need one ticket for my little brother.
Huh?
But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
"They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses."
"Dammit!  Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.  Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!"
"Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!"
"There, what do you think?"
"I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner."
"Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!"
I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
"Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!"
"Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky."
"Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up."
"No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him."
"Put him down, you stupid dog!"
"Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?"
What??
"You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!"
"Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska!"
"Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility."
You bastards!
"Aw, how the hell should I know?"
"All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother."
"Yeah, right."
He's not my brother!
"I'm sorry, Ike."
What do you want?!
"Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!"
No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
"Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!"
You stay away from my little brother!
"You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!"
And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
"No!  No, it isn't true!"
"It's okay, Ike. I'm here."
"Ike, you're okay."
"Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about."
And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.
M'kay?
We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
"No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school."
I caught it! I caught it!
"Here, Pip, you throw."
"Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?"
"Throw the ball, you stupid frog!  God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,  you'd be able to-- Ow!"
"Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!"
"No. No, it'll be okay!"
Oh-- Noooo!
Ye-yes.
Ye-yes.
I know.
Oh!  Phew.
"Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball."
AAGGGGGHHHH!!
OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
"...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled."
No. No-it looked dead.
"Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?"
And then she walked over to--
Uhhhh... Yeah.
Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
"Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?"
"Go for it, Pip."
"Come on, you Frenchy little frog!"
"Get him, Frenchy!"
"Some hadka fish, some gafagga..."
"Wow, that was easy."
"Hey, why did you guys forfeit?"
Know what?
But we could get killed!
"Dude, what does that mean?"
"Yeah, you're from China."
"But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people."
You... bastards...
What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
Agghh!
"Well sorry, dude, we weren't here."
"Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool."
"Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?"
"Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show."
Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
"Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison?"
F-minus? Can he do that?
How do you know? You weren't even there.
"Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!"
"We've got to get him back, dude."
"Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing."
Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy...
"Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!"
Come on! We've gotta make another one!
"Der, Cartman!"
"Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk!"
"'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!"
"Dude, they're gonna look so stupid."
Look!
"Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke!"
"Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!"
Who are you?
You bastards!
Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
Wait a sec. Where is your producer?
"Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!"
"Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there."
"I know, but, it's really snowy today."
"Oh, she would, dude. She would."
"Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!"
I'm scared!
"Yeah, what are we supposed to do?"
"'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!"
"I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'"
"We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days."
What?
Worse than this?
How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
"Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!"
Sure you do!
"Fart, damn you!"
"Whoa, look at that."
"Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream."
You can say that again.
Nope.
"Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny."
"Don't do it, kid."
"Holy crap, dude!"
On Wednesday or Thursday?
"Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus."
"Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt."
Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
Oh my God! Look at his leg!
Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
Dude! He's making ice cream.
"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation."
"Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!"
What was what?
What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
"Hey yeah, I remember that."
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
You... bastard?
"Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right?"
You bastard!
We've just gotta stick together.
You bastards!
"Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?"
What are we gonna do?
There.  I think we got it.
Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
"Don't do it, kid."
"Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream!"
"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation."
"Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it."
Du-hude! Your dad's a retard!
Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
Oh no!
Hello?
Really?
Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.
Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
What do you mean?
I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
We wanna buy M-80s.
What a baby.
What do ya mean?
"Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?"
Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
Oo bastards!
"Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?"
"Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks."
Yeah!
"Let's go, dude. We're ready."
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
Dusty the dirtball
"Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison."
"Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?"
Yup.
"Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee."
"Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics."
"Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always."
Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
Dude! That thing is huge!
Kenny! Watch out!
You bastard!
"What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!"
What'd he say?
How is that gonna help?
"A lot, I think."
"I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon."
We're bored.
Wow! These are huge!
"Hey, look! It's snowing!"
"Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?"
"They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?"
"Sick, Kenny."
All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
Cool!
If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
"I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-"
"I'm poopies, ma!"
Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
Could it be?
"Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?"
"It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!"
"Well, I'm sure it was him."
"So how was that movie last night, dude?"
Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass.
Well?
There it is again!
It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble.
Where does that grill go?
"Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!"
"Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer!"
"We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey."
What the hell?
In a sewer?
"Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?"
Mr. Hankey!
I told you guys he'd be here!
"What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?"
And that's why you got a cold?
"Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys."
"Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?"
Aaahh!
"Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food."
"He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die."
Huh??
"Dude, no one even listened to me."
Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey?
They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
"Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!"
"Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?"
"Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!"
"You guys, we have to hurry!"
Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!
I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
I want you guys to all meet my friend.
"You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't."
"Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?"
Nooohohohohohoho-
"What is it, Mr. Hankey?"
What is it?
Yes?
Nooo!
Nooo!
Noo! No!
Uuf.
I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
"Chef, does poo go to heaven?"
Mr. Hankey?
He's back! He's back!
"You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef."
Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you!
Behold! Mr. Hankey!
No!
O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead.
I don't know.
"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!"
Are you guys having a meeting or something?
Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
"Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house."
"Heheheh, buns."
Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
I don't know.
Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
"Cartman, what the hell is that?"
"No, it's not cool!"
Yeah. I feel great!
"Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast."
Yes. Why?
"No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!"
"Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him."
Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
"Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?"
"But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?"
Gods and clods?
"Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!"
"Could we go home now, Ma?"
But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
"What's ""ookie mouth""?"
"Sick, dude!"
"Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!"
Argh!
"I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible."
What the hell does that have to do with American history?
"Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes."
"What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?"
"""So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."""
What?
Oh my God!
You!
You!
You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
"Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!"
"You get away from me, you crazy woman!"
Stan! Stan!
"Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?"
Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
"They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway."
Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
Because they're a bunch of assholes.
"Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!"
"Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?"
"Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face."
"No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back."
"Chef, we wanna know about herpes."
Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
Do you know anybody with herpes?
"Cool! Thanks, Chef!"
Are you old Frida?
Someone who wants a favor.
Huh?
"Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital."
"D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!"
"Aw, man.  I don't feel so good."
Ugh...
We're sorry.
"This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman."
I'm better now.
We gave you guys herpes.
You bastards!
"Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention."
To where?
"Yeah, all the constellations look alike."
"You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!"
"I thought it was ""plane-tarium."""
"Hey, who are you?"
Whoopie.
"Oh, man, I don't feel so good."
Me too. It was sweet.
Did what?
My head still feels funny.
"Like you really need it, hippo-ass!"
"Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!"
"Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd."
"Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?"
I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
"Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too."
"I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV."
What do you mean?
Sshh!
Why?
"Oh, yeah."
Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
"You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars."
What does that do?
Kenny! What's it doing?
We're bastards!
"We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!"
"But it's true, dude!"
"Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!"
He's not highly intelligent.
Cartman! You saved us!
He got a full dose of the stars.
"Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing."
Yeah! You're dead!
"Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!"
Well? Now what are we going to do?
I dunno.
Okay.
We do?
"Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip."
"Whoa, dude!"
"Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!"
"Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?"
"Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass."
What? Why?
Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives!
"It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!"
"Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?"
Fine!
Fine!
Fine!
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"Good guess, dude!"
Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
To me??
"We should use nails, dude."
"Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?"
"Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?"
"Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy."
Okay.
"Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls."
Right. Why?
Too eager to what?
Okay.
Yeah?
Umm. Dare?
What?
"What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!"
"It's just wrong, that's all."
What the hell have you gotten me into?!
Hoh boy.  Sick!  Aggghhh! Fucking sickening!
Okay.
Huh?
"Okay, that's fine."
But I don't care.
You bastard!
"Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls."
"Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs."
"Dude, that kicks ass!"
"You suck, Cartman!"
Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
But ih-
"Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!"
Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom.
"Mom, give me some money!"
I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
I will if you give me money!
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
Is it like a- haunted house or something?
"No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
"You'd better be right, dude."
Okay.
That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
"That was a waste of money, Cartman!"
We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
This ride better be good!
We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
Finally!
Yeah.
Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
"Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!"
"You dumbass, Cartman!"
"No, it's not cool!"
"How much do we have left, Cartman?  How much do we have left, Cartman?!"
"What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!"
You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
"Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!"
"Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?"
"Give him your food stamps, Kenny!"
"Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!"
Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS!
I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
"Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator."
This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
It worked!
No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
What?!
"You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-"
"Damnit, I have to have those dolls!"
"Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!"
"Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!"
"All right! Now, come on! We have to practice!"
"You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?"
That wasn't quite ten seconds.
"Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!"
"What'd you say, Cartman??"
I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
"Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull."
"Okay, Cartman. You ready?"
Open the gate!
That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
Get the bull in the balls with a snowball.
That's better.
"Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough!"
"No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP!"
"Dude, I think we broke him."
..Oh.
We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
Damn it!
You think?
He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
"Yeah, I think so."
"Hey, where's Cartman?"
"He's up in, like, twenty minutes!"
"Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake."
What do you mean?
"Hang on, Cartman!"
"Go help him, Kenny!"
You bastard!
How many ball does that get us?
You will?
"We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!"
What are we gonna do with them?
..What the-?
After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS!
"Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!"
"Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh."
Really? What about?
"No! Cartman, that was just a dream!"
"What the hell are you singing, Cartman?"
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
He'd be better used as a coat rack.
He singing some new hit song.
"Wow, then you should get money for it!"
"Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time."
It’s the same goddamn song!
We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
I don't know.
"I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman."
What's going on?
"Yeah. Ready, Cartman?"
"What's that, dude?"
Did you ever know any famous people?
"You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you."
"Yeah, b-but how?"
"Whoa, dude, this house is huge."
Are you Elton John?
"Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?"
We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
"Yeah, dude."
"Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!"
"He’s not dying, Cartman!"
Yeah. Do you know him?
"Gosh, thanks, Rick James."
We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
Cartman?
But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
Dude… Chef is gone.
But what are we gonna do?
Chef Aid?
"Hey, that's a great idea!"
Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
"Wow, cool!"
We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
"Well, we helped."
You bastard!
"Hey, that's your song for Wendy!"
He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
"Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?"
Did you eat too many pork rinds last night?
"What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!"
"Where have you been, dude?"
Aunt Flo?
Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
Here he comes.
"You said you could get us money, Cartman!"
"Well, at least he's back to normal."
It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
That's not cool!
"It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?"
"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good."
"God, will you shut up?!"
Yeah.
"I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again."
"You seem tired, Stan."
Why?
"Hoh, that sucks, dude."
Cartman?
"You can't be standing there, Cartman."
Because you're standing over there!
"Uh, Chef?"
Chef.
Chef.
Chef!
We have problems!
Will you stop saying that word?!
Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
"There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude."
"Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book."
What?
"Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"""
Why?
Like what?
"You kick ass, evil Cartman!"
"You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him!"
"Hey, yeah! I almost forgot."
"Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella."""
"Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?"
"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!"
"Leave him alone, butthole!"
It's the evil pets
"We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe!"
Which one is the good Cartman?
"Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!"
"Oh no, dude!"
Damn it!
"That's nice, Cartman."
Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
Please stop.
Please stop!
What's all that stuff?
"Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!"
"I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous."
It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
Cool!
"Oh, God!"
"Jesus Christ, finally!"
Agghh!
That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
"Dude, your family died?"
What?!
What is this??
"Sick, dude!"
"Whoa, dude!"
Aaww!
"Jesus, dude!"
I know what you mean.
Arrggh!
"Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!"
Oh. Arrggh!
"I heard it, too."
"I wanted to make sure, too."
"Dude, it's coming through the window!"
"We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman."
"Yeah, they do!"
"Dude, we have to get to the mall!!"
"Good for you, Charlie!"
Do you see him?
I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!
"That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous."
So?!
"Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants."
"Hoh, boy. Here we go!"
You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake!
Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
What?! What did you say?!
Behold! Here's your false prophet!
It was a fake!
Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
"I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!"
"God, I hate the holiday season!"
"What's your mom doing here, dude?"
You bastards!
Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
Yeah.
We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
"No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?"
"Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
"Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up."
We're his oral report buddies.
Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
"Come on, you guys! We better get to work!"
"Man, this stuff is strong."
Don't worry about it.
"Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up."
Woohoo!
"Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!"
"Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?"
Killer!!
"Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!"
"Hogh, my stomach hurts."
"Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek."
Sure.
"Thanks, dude."
"Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!"
"""And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America..."
"And that's our report, I guess."
I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
My butt hurts.
Uh...
I don't like big corporations.
"Oh, God, when is this gonna end?"
So what are we gonna say?
Does anybody know anything about corporations?
"Well, how about we just say, ""corporates should be stopped""?"
"Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!"
"Sshh, don't scare him."
Cartman!
Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
"Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid."
Show us.
Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
"Sooo, what's phase 2?"
Do you guys know anything about corporations?
"You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers."
What?
Big corporations are good!
Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
"Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time."
"Go, dude, go!"
Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
"That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!"
"Get away from me, Cartman!"
AAAAAAAAAA!
HELP!
You guuuys!
I think so. Is Cartman up there?
"Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat."
I don't think so.
"Sick, dude!"
"Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here."
"Dude, it's a dude!"
Wow. Cool.
"Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!"
I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
"No, dude! We have to name it Steve."
"It's my name, and I found him."
"What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!"
"Kenny, who found the ice man?"
But we found a frozen ice man from the past!
No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
We came for our reward.
Sweet. How about Steve?
"Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope-"
Gorak's a gay name.
Why are you being such a dick?
Nuh-uh!
I'll go.
You bastards!
"Good job, dude! You freaked him out!"
Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
Fine!
"No, he sure doesn't."
"Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!"
He's my creature!
But it isn't right!
What?! I'm not talking to you!
I'm here to bust out Steve.
His name is Steve!
Steve!
Steve!
"Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man"
Does so!
You're a dick!
"You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!"
"Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?"
"Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick!"
"Steve, wait!"
"I've got something to show Steve, dick!"
"Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!"
"It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you."
"Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!"
"No you don't, butthole!"
"We have to get our friend, Steve-"
"Frosty, Steve, whatever."
"Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now."
"Okay. First one to die, loses."
Okay.
"So, here we go."
Go.
Ow!
Oh.
"Oh. Okay, it's over this way"
Later.
Uhuh.
Cool.
His name... is Steve!
"Steve! Steve, look out!"
"Steve, look out!"
I can't believe he's gone.
Hey!
"No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him."
"Me, too. He sucks."
"Shut up, fatass!"
"Hey, Craig."
Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
You can't do that!
Thanks!
"Fuck off, Cartman!"
No! That's a stereotype.
"God-damn, it's hot out here!"
"No, dude. That's a branch."
No. That's the same branch again.
What's the Yanogapa?
My guess would be 'yes.'
"Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!"
"Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back."
"Um, no."
Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
Aaaaa! There's a dude here!
I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
Hey!
Yeah. It happened once before.
"Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people."
What the hell?
Yeah! Fragile my ass!
Dude! Bulldozers rule!
You bastards!
They're... they're bastards.
What?
"Whoa, dude!"
"No, I don't think so."
"No, that's a hair dryer!"
"Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""?"
I need to get a nurection for my dad.
"Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody?"
I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
You bastards!
Yeah.
"Well, I'm Jewish."
I guess not.
"Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!"
We'll do it! We'll do it!
"Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?"
He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
This is gonna be fun.
You're too fat to be Jesus!
Stan should be Jesus.
You're such a fat baby!
"All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!"
Die!
"I don't know you, dude."
"Hey, that went really well. They really liked it."
"Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!"
Yeah. That looks pretty good.
"Yeah, me too."
"Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days."
Then I can give it to my dad.
"Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection."
"Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad."
"How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!"
"Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap!"
"We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!"
Jesus Christ!
"(Dude, I think you pooed a lot.)"
"God, that was not cool at all, dude!"
Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.
(Sick!)
It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
"Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too."
"Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak."
"Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up!"
She's not worried about you.
How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
"Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade."
"Yeah, take that!"
"...Oh, yeah. Sorry."
"Dude, those people are pissed!"
Where's your dad?
"Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad."
"Dude, that was Star Trek again."
"""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan."
She's upstairs.
Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore.
"Well, my dad is, too."
I forgot all about him.
Wow!
"Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?"
I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
"Yeah.  Oh, here he comes."
Why?
"Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do."
Mr. Derp?
Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
"Shut up, Cartman!"
"Yeah, but we didn't believe them."
Moving in?!
"But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better."
This... is insane.
That bitch!
He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
"Yeah, so?"
"Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around."
Good idea.
They said that Chef works in one of these buildings
Dude! Just take them off!
"He's a big guy, with a beard."
"We need you, Chef."
"Chef, this place isn't you!"
"No way, dude!"
Chef should be here any minute.
I can't believe it!
"All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!"
"Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!"
"Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?"
"All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?"
That's it!
This is totally what's happening!
"Thanks, Mr. Garrison."
Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
"Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him."
There he is!
We have to talk to him!
What's tree-fitty?
Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
"Well, you are taking Chef from us."
This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
"Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!"
I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
"Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."""
I don't know.
Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
In three hours.
Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open.
He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
Bitch.
Dirty bitch.
"Now, Cartman!!"
Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!!
You bastard!
It's great to have you back Chef!
Mr. Adler?
"Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble"
"Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec."
Do you wanna bet?
"Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him?"
There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
"So, do you agree to fight him after school?"
We'll see!
"Yeah. That's not cool, dude."
Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
What?
"Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet!"
Tweek?
"Well, Craig showed up."
"And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!"
"Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya."
He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
"Shut up, fatass!!"
"That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!"
Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
"Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy."
"No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby."
How??
Not like that!
Fine!
"Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!"
"Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low."
"This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek."
"Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!"
"Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?"
Craig just called you a boner!
We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
You bastards!
"Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other."
"Boy, do we ever."
"Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters."
"This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,..."
Just go behind a tree.
"Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!"
"You just squat, stupid!"
Watch out for ground eels!
What do you have to think about?
"No way, dude!"
What?
"Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!"
Over here!
It just ran by here a second ago.
It's stupid.
"You don't like anything, Cartman!"
Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
What are we supposed to do with him?
"Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!"
"What are you doing, fatass?!"
"They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!"
Shut up!!
"Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby."
"Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was."
Gross!
"Dude, this sucks ass!"
"We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears."
There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
Cartman! Wait!
Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
About what?
"This is freaking me out, dude."
Dude! He got a lawyer?
Dad?!
It's... big.
"Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?"
And you don't see a problem with that?
"You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?"
"I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money."
"Hey, what about that stupid panda?"
Huh?
Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
"Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!"
"Hoh God, here we go."
Isn't that fascism?
Do you?
What??
You bastards!  Hey! There he is!
"Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!"
"No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume!"
"Okay, sorry, sorry."
That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
Wait!
Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
"Hoh, dude, weak."
Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me.
"I'm coming, Ma!"
"""Get ready"", ""answer the door"", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind!"
"Oh! Hey, Kenny."
"I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee."
"It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure."
Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
"Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight."
"No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!"
"No, Ike!"
I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
What? You want me to lie?
"Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--"
"Wow, cool."
He was huge.
Who are you?
"You have to go with him, Ike."
"Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building."
Kyle Broflovski.
"Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg."
This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
"That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand."
"This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up."
"Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle."
This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
"It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!"
"Shh. Shut up, Kenny."
"That's Moses, stupid!"
It's a duck.
Don't worry. I know what to do.
"Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish."
He doesn't get cake?
"Dude, what the hell is going on?!"
"Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us."
Kenny will find a way.
"Go, Ike!"
What is that?
Look!
Kenny! Noooooo!
Kenny!
"You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass."
Hey dudes.  What are those?
Huh?
"No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll."
Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
What's the Primary Main Objective?
"Well, what's the Evil Power?"
What?
Shit!
"Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?"
I'm not sure.
I don't know.
"Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon."
"Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass."
Thanks.
Neither do I.
Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
What?
Huh? No.
Damnit!
I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller!
Camp?
"No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight?"
"Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?"
"What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen?"
God damnit!
...our hearts.  Kenny?
...Power.
Destroy it?
Liberace gay.
Owatta Beikoku!
But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
What?
"Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!"
So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
"But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya."
"Aw, screw it; I'm too confused."
"Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while."
"No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!"
"Relax, fatass."
"You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!"
Cartman!
"God job, fatass!"
Why would anybody send this asshole money?
Yeh-hah.
Starvin' Marvin!
He did take a ship.
I think he wants us to get in.
Let's go somewhere.
Yes!
"No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too."
"Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?!"
Where are we?
This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
"Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'."
"Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there."
"Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!"
No!
"Oh, no, dude!"
"I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!"
Watch out! Here I come!
Kenny!
"Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!"
What was that?
"Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar."
"Well, how'd we do it last time??"
"Which button did you press, Cartman??"
You don't remember?!
"Yeah, now finish 'em off!"
Where did that come from??
"Sorry, Marvin. We tried."
It's pulling us in!
Marvin...
"Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars."
Thanks.
"No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth."
"Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween."
"Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff."
"Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck."
The what?
Nuh-uh.
Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
"That's not scary, fatass!"
"He must have a huge bone in his ass, then."
"Yeah, fatass, a dead body."
"Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!"
"Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??"
Are you insane?!
Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
"Naww, let's dig up somebody else."
"This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma."
Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
"I don't really care, dude."
"Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma."
Aaaah!
"Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!"
"Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!"
How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
"Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!"
Cartman?!
Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
No Grandma??
She's not here!
"Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!"
"God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!"
Somebody took my dead grandma.
Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo.
"Then, you'll help us?"
Right.
Wow! That was easy.
Whoa. What was that?
Yeah! Where's Grandma?
"Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you."
"What's a ""home-schooled kid""?"
Wow!
What??
Definition?
"Uh, could you use it in a sentence?"
"""Krocsyldiphic."""
"""Krocsyldiphic."" C  Damnit!"
What's your name?
Wooww.
"Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?"
"...Uuh, can I talk to her?"
"U-u-uh, hi."
"Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all."
...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
What??
"Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school."
"Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,"
Huh?
"Uuuh, okay.  Gah!"
"Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go."
You will?
"No no. I mean, go with me."
You got my note?
"Uh, can we sit down?"
"Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?"
"Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us."
"From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study"
"Love, for one thing."
"Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss."
When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
"Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy."
I'm not completely sure.
"No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right."
Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
"Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams!"
You suck!
Rebecca. You...
Uh. All I did was show her how to-
Aaaah!
Ooww!
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
"Well, you have to hit it softer!"
"You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!"
"Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!"
Cartman!!!
"Give me the drum, and you play the flute."
You dick!
He'll show.
"Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?"
Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
"The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!"
"No they're not, stupid!"
How much do you wanna bet?!
"Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!"
And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
You're on!
Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
What do we do?!
"You cheated, Cartman!"
"Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!"
"They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop."
"I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?"
Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
"We have to stop him, dude."
We'll give you 10 bucks.
"You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!"
Hey!
Yeah.
"Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-"
We'll never stop them now.
"Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States."
"Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year."
Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off!
"Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!"
What??
"Yeah. Thanks, dick!"
"Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play."
Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
"Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!"
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
I made you out of clay.
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
with dreidel I shall play.
"Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay."
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play."
"Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
I made you out of clay.
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
with dreidel I shall play.
"Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
I made you out of clay.
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
with dreidel I shall play.
"Hi, Mom!"
"Oh, hi Dad."
"Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!"
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
I made you out of clay.
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
with dreidel I shall play.
"Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
I made you out of clay.
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
with dreidel I shall play.
Dad?
Dad.
We're singing about a dreidel.
"Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
I made you out of clay.
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
with dreidel I shall play.
"Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
I made you out of clay.
"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,"
with dreidel I shall play.
"Bye, Mr. Hankey. See you next year."
I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
"What, fatass?!"
You got your what?
"Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right!"
"Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass."
"Dude, did you get your period yet?"
"Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty."
Yeah.
"You got your period too, Kenny?"
"Ike, can I talk to you?"
"Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!"
"Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore."
"Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little."
"Thanks a lot, Ike!"
"You guys! I got my period, too!"
"Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place."
Awesome! We get powers?
Here.
"I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde."
Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
"Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly."
Phew.
"Okay. Today's word is ""spirituality."" What that means to me is uh-"
Hormones?
"Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones."
"Whoa, dude!"
"Hey, here comes Stan."
"Did you get your period yet, Stan?"
How do know that?
"Shut up, fatass!"
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
"Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!"
Nuh-uh!
"There is no brown noise, fat boy!"
Who the hell are these guys?
"Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!"
Kenny?
"Alright, dickhole!"
"Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere!"
"Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef."
What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
Awwgh!
"Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means."
Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
How about... finkleroy?
Mung's good.
"Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?"
Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up!
Eewww.
"Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!"
What the hell is that lady talking about?
Yeah. They think they're so cool.
"Calm down, Cartman."
I don't believe it!
That's amazing.
"Yeah, dude!"
We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
This is gonna be sweet!
"Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-"
"Well, that whole experience sure did suck."
Huh?
"Oh, no!"
Huh?
Oh yeah?!
Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
Fatass.
What the hell are they doing?
"Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon."
"Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman."
"Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde."
"Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!"
"Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move."
"Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?!"
We killed Kenny?
"Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?"
If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
How?
Sweet! Let's go!
"Hey, fatass. How's prison?"
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
An ailnay ilefay.
"Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!"
"They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!"
"Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-"
Me too.
Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals.
So now what do we do?
"Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away."
Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?
Killer.
"Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!"
"Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit!  Oh, sorry."
Huh?
Why not?
"I don't start, you start."
"And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?"
"But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday."
He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
"Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him."
"On the sled, fatass!"
"Go, fatass!"
Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
We won! We won!
"It's good to have you back, Cartman."
He's fat and he's stupid?
No way!
I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
...Totally what?
Me too.
"You still have baby teeth, Kenny?"
"Almost. You ready, Timmy?"
"When I say ""go,"" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?"
Right. You're Timmy.
"Alright! Get ready, Timmy."
"Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth."
"Yeah, let's go."
"No, Timmy, wait!"
"Come on, fatass!"
Did the tooth fairy come?
Four dollars?
No more money??
"Cartman, what's going on?!"
"What do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?"""
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
"You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!"
It's not true!
"Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?"
Oh my God! You did lie to me.
"Peter Pan, too??"
What about Moses and Abraham?
Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
Wahahahah!
"Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah!"
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
"Oh my God, what if I'm not real?"
"I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?"
What if this is all just somebody's dream?
Two years?
Cartman!
See ya.
"Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality."
"Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one."
"Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?"
"I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!"
"But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together?"
"Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading."
"Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening!"
"I am nothing, and everything."
Hunh. That was pretty weird.
"Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us."
Awwww!
How long does this thing last?
Whoa.
Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!"
"Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville."
Let's go practice.
It's Kenny's singing!
What?!
"What's a ""quin-tuplet""?"
But there's only four of you.
"So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?"
How can you say that?
"Oh, yeah!"
"Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going."
"You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there."
Alright!
"Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??"
"Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!"
Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
The Declaration of Independence?
Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
...I am eight.
No way!
"Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?"
We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
"That's correct, Chef."
"Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium"
"No, not at all."
"Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin?"
"Yes, let's."
You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
Bastard.
"Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us."
Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
"Come, see him with us."
Yeah.
Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
Yeah!
Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!
"Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn."
What?
AIDS?!
What?
"You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!"
"See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out."
"I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah!"
Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
"We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt."
"Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny."
"What are you talking about, fatass?"
They are?
We don't wanna go!
We don't WANNA go!
"Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too."
"Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?"
Dude. Being mature is boring!
"I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here!"
Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
How?
Dude. You have sex with children.
Dude. You have sex with children.
Seriously.
"Well, Cartman"
Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
"I don't know, I..."
How much?
"Better, thanks."
"Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan."
Oh. ...Thanks?
Huh?  What the?
Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
Told ya.
"Yeah, we got it."
"Yeah, me neither."
Not really.
"Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them?"
"Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!"
"I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner."
"Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend."
"Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there."
"Pretty good, I guess."
"Kenny ate all the mints, dad."
Oh.
"Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing."
Huh?
W-we really didn't see it that way.
"Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter."
Yeah.
"Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?"
"No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist."
...How?
I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
"So, all boy bands have five members."
"'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members."
It was?
I promised my mom I'd let him try.
"Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!"
"Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!"
Me too.
I wanna be the tough one.
I wanna be the tough one!
Jews are tough!
"Since Abraham, fatass!"
Jesus Christ!
Wow. I feel so rejected.
Run for it!
"Dude, what's wrong with your leg?"
Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there.
He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
It's Stan!
"Dude, where the hell have you been?!"
You bastards!
"Dude, he's pretty dead."
"We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!"
We made two dollars.
Yeah.
...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
"Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million?"
"Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?"
Uhwuwhat?
No-o-o-o-o!
Oh good. I don't?
I am not!
I'm gonna go ask my mom!
Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?
"Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell."
We don't? But what if we're wrong?
"Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell."
"Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me!"
Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.
"Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?"
Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
HAAAAH!
But what if we're wrong?
"Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever."
"Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!"
"Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!"
Ask him what hell is like.
Yes!
Yes!
Ow!
"Uh, I think so."
Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
You're keeping that money yourself?
Then why didn't you tell us?!
The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
"Serves you right, Cartman!"
Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders!
"Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!"
"Ungh, gay, dude."
"You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver."
He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship!
...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
Together we are strong!
"Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?"
"Holy God, dude!"
Yeah!
And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
I just didn't think it would come so soon.
Huh?
Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
How?
"Oh yeah, time travel."
"Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement."
So can you do it?
"I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!"
Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
Come on!
What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
No??
Oh no! What have we done?!
"What do you mean, ""can't""?! You made it work; just build us another one!"
Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
"Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!"
"Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either."
"Yeah! You suck, Cartman!"
"Hey, Timmy's back!"
Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
"Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten."
"But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek."
"Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!"
He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
"He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--"
"Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"
You are?
I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
"No, I don't! I don't care!"
"Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!"
I'm gonna!
I will!
Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
"Whoa, dude..!"
"Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast."
That should do it.
"Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!"
"Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!"
Hey! What are you doing?
Oh... Okay.
"Yeah, that'd be faster."
Here we go again.
"Dammit, Cartman, open up!"
Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
"Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!"
You ba--!
Why is that bad?
"Step on it, Bill Cosby!"
"Not-- Aw, damnit..!"
"I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU."
"Screw you, fat ass!"
Cartman!
No!
I can't reach the CPU.
Got 'em!
"I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak."
Can we take a lunch break now?
"What is it, Butters?"
We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
Okay!
"A smart one, that can do tricks."
"Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!"
"What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!"
"Alright, we'll take him. How much?"
But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
"...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy, let's go!"
"Aw, blow it out your ass!"
It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles.
"Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one..."
I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
"Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it."
"Timmy, we already got a turkey."
"Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off."
What Butters?
So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
"You ready for the big show, Timmy?"
"Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?"
"He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave."
"Hey, look!"
"Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be."
Butters told us their play was awesome!
"Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny."
"Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!"
"Aw, dude, check this out."
"Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?"
I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
"Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!"
What's the matter?
Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it.
"Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen!  How much, Kenny?"
I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
"That's 19 bucks, Kenny!"
"Kick ass, dude!"
Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
Whoa!
What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
Good point.
Huh? Why not?
I don't know.
Why?
"Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you?"
"Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?"
Six hours.
Great.
For what?
Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
"He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus."
"...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!"
"Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great."
"Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!"
Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
"Come on. Throw the football, Ike."
Hepatitis B?
...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
Hold on. I'll be right back.
"Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?"
But all the guys are going!
"But Mom, I-"
Ugh!
My parents said I can't go.
"Ah. Oh, now I already told them."
No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later.
"...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!"
What's Cuba?
"And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?"
"Hoh, geez."
Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
"And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish."
I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
What??
"But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!"
But that's not fair! You lied to me!
What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
Well I wish I didn't have any parents!
It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
How?!
What's that?
Wow! Three months without parents!
Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
"""My parents molestered me."""
"What's ""bad touch""?"
"Okay, molestered, bad touch."
"Cool, thanks."
...Nothing.
Not one adult left?
Yeah.
The fatass. The mayor.
"Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that."
"Sure, outlander. I'll get it"
Parents. Mom. Dad.
Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
"Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us?"
Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
Did you make it to your job interview?
"Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are."
Mom! Dad!
Yeah. We're fine.
But you didn't do anything to me.
"But, you guys, I--"
Huh.
Sure.
"He's gonna be here any minute, Ike."
"Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me."
"Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does."
"Happy Chanukah, Mom."
Go away!
Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
"Okay, good. You're all here."
It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
"It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come."
"If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!"
"Dude, you sneezed on my back!"
"Hey, look.  Hello?"
"...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-"
But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
Sure we'll help!
"Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!"
"Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!"
"We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town!"
How hard can it be? Look at it.
Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
"Ah, Mr. Hankey?"
"We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card."
"Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days."
"Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got."
"They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us."
"God job, Butters."
See ya!
"No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later."
What's a hard p?
"Oh, yeah."
We wish-
What?
"Well, yes, I think so."
"Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--"
"Don't you oppress me, fat boy."
Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
"Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame."
Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
"Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame."
That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot!
"Now, the next mouth."
"Okay, where are the E-mouths?"
"Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again?"
So how much done is that?
"Aw,  Jesus Christ!"
"Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames."
Cartman!
Fine! We'll do it with out you!
We'll dub his voice over.
"Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!"
You love-
-And I'll labor.
You sit-
-And I'll stand.
"You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?"
"Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter."
Cool! Now let's try the script!
"Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy."
You wish-
-And I'll whittle.
You sit-
-And I'll stand.
"Let's all try to help a little, 'cause"
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!"
"Okay, Mr. Hankey!"
What?
"Yeah, I think so."
What?
Dreidel dreidel dreidel-
All that hard work.
But we spent it!
All that work!
"Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey."
What the--
They did it! They got it working!
...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
"Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted."
What?
Ah.
Yeah.
"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!"
"Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days."
Hey you guys! Look what I have!
Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
"Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool."
"What, doughboy?"
What?
What?!
"Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?"
"They're gonna say ""shit"" on television?"
Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
It's stupid!
"No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!"
"Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else."
How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
I don't really give a fuck!
Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
"Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?"
"Oh, whatever."
This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
"It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!"
There's no sand in my vagina!!!
"You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying!"
"Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television."
"I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death""."
"Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on!"
"Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from?"
"No no! The word, ""shit""."
"Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death""."
"Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague."
A... curse word.
"Cartman, this is serious!!!"
"Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire!"
"We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word!"
"Cartman, stop being an asshole!"
"We think that you might have could it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word."
"It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny."
...No.
Now what?
We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
And asshole.
Wait!
It's okay. The curse has been lifted.
"You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems."
We're all saying the S-word too much!
"The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances."
"That's pretty cool, dude!"
"He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass."
"Wow, that's cool!"
Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
"""David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go."
I'm not really happy.
My potential hasn't even been reached.
Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
"We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four...."
"So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95."
You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
I'm Kyle.
What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..
What are we doing?
"Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere."
"It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something."
Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
I'm not going anywhere!
Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
You're Stan.
Then I guess... I'm a dumbass.
"Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore."
"Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you."
That's right.
"...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square."
David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
How many tickets can we put you down for?
Great!
That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
"I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a-"
This is a really good turnout.
"Dude, no way!"
"Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist."
Yeah. Why is that good news?
Mass suicide?
"Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!"
It's just me.
Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
"I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad."
"I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too."
"Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell?"
"What have you done, Cartman?!"
"Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!"
"Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!"
"Cartman, no!"
You bastards!
You bastards!
Stan!
I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water!
Wagh.
Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
"Haha, hehahaha."
"What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?!"
...What the hell are you talking about?!
"What's ""pubes""?"
Oh.  No you didn't!
Hell no!
Uh what are those?
Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
"Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!"
Yuh huh!
"Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!"
Yeah.
"Cartman, can I give you some advice?"
"Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you."
One please.
"Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off."
What's in it for us?
"Okay, Cartman, what do you want?"
"Oh, Jesus!"
"Okay, so what's the plan?"
...What?
"You're such a dumbass, Cartman."
Scott Tenorman?
"We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch."
"'Cause, we're his friends."
'Cause we hate him.
"Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya."
"Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this."
"Yeah, sure."
"Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again."
"Okay, dude, it's 3:30."
"Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch."
Oh my God!
Write the number down! Write the number down!!
"I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!"
What??
Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
"Uhuh, but that's why we're going."
"See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival."
"Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!"
"Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat."
"Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?"
We have to talk to Terrance.
Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.
"Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh."
"Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform."
"Phillip, your partner."
But the guy who replaced him sucks!
But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
"Uuuh, we didn't get them."
"Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy."
"Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada."
"Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side."
"They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."""
"I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times."
Ih-it'll be okay.
They said they'd come.
He's here!
Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
"Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?"
See? I told you it would work.
You can't leave! The show starts soon!
You bastards!
"Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video!"
"Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month."
"Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!"
"I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!"
Haaah!
"Wait! dude, LOOK!"
"""No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"""
"""Have mercy!""  Yeah ha ha!"
Nuh uh.
"What the hell are you doing, fatass?!"
Kenny wasn't lying.
Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
"No... No, this isn't possible."
"No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?"
Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
"Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park."
"Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow."
Great.
It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.
"So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!"
"Hunh, I guess you're right."
Where are we going?
"Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!"
Hohohooho! Oowwww!
"Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!"
"Oh God, get me off of here!!"
"Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!"
My life can't get any worse!
Lucky.
"Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?"
"But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude."
"Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?"
No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
Agh!  Agghh!
Awesome.
I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
Satan talked to God?
And that's it? That's the end?
That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
"Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God."
Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh...
Huh?
Huh?
You are up there!
"""No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."""
"""Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"""
"""AAAAAAAH!"""
"What's this all about, Kenny?"
No they don't!
That's awesome!
"You ""beat off?"""
"Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""?"
Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
What the hell is wrong with them?
No.
Nuh uh.
Is that what you learned in sex ed?
"Oh my God, dude."
Yeah. Quick!
Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
"Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things."
"Uh, what are ""studzes"""
It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
Sure.
Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
"You mean, intercourse with a girl?"
"Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!"
Yeah! You get out of town!
"Man, he's pretty good."
Seventeen?
HA! I killed you!
"Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?"
"Hyeah, that poor, poor thing"
"Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?"
"Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?"
Cool!
"Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM."
"Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park."
"Awesome!  Oh, crap."
I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
"I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake."
"Thanks, Towelie."
"Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games."
"Okay, turn it on."
"Oh, this is so cool."
"Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?"
"Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!"
"She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight.."
Uh no.
No we don't wanna get high!
Me too.
"Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid."
What? You mean Towelie?
"Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29!"
Where is it?
Where the hell is it??
What?
"Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!"
Where the hell is he?
What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
That's a towel call?
"Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water."
There he is!
Just come on! It's getting dark.
Are you sure this is where they said to be?
"Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!"
"Aw, God-damnit!"
Are we getting close?
How long has it been since you've been back there.
The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is!
That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
"All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?"
Who's they?
Okay.
"Dude, I figured it out."
"If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!"
Seven and a half.
That's it?
Well let's look in here.
What terrifying secret?
And we don't care.
Go ahead.
"Photon rifle, whatever."
Our GameSphere!
Sweet!
Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer!
I've almost got it!
I got it!
Awesome!
Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
"These are gas masks, Butters!"
"Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe."
"Dude, what's going on?"
Well what are we supposed to do with it?
"Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster."
"Uh oh, they're closing!"
Yeah.
"Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us."
"Hey, wait! There are children in here!"
Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse?
"Oh God, it was horrible!"
Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
"You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people!"
"Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!"
Is this the right house?
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Then why did you send us the goat?
Jawas?
"Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!"
"Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?"
"Good job, fatass!"
"Oh crap, it's him!"
But I thought you hate us.
"Cartman, where are you going??"
"Cartman, he's crazy!"
Where do we go?
"All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America."
"Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!"
Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
Yeah.
I'm confused.
Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
Yeah.
Go America.  Go Broncos.
I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
No. This is taking forever.
"What, Cartman?"
"It isn't that funny, Cartman."
But I never take off my hat.
This is how I look natural.
Crap.
Gay-ass.
Hello?
Hello?
Cartman?
I don't know. Let's go see.
Why'd you call us?
...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
"No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children."
"...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?"
...Nuh uh.
"Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!"
Uh
"Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house."
"Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
Blew a funny fuse?
Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
Alright.
Butters! Hey Butters!
"They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!"
"Dude, that poor kid."
"Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them."
Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
"When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh."
"There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad."
"Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up."
What's he look like?
I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother.
Hey dude.
"Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?"
"Oh is, is this beef?"
"Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass."
"Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-"
"We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble."
"What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?"
"Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?"
"Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on."
"Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle."
I can't believe how cold it is out here.
It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
"Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?"
Cartman?!
"Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are."
"...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker."
Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
"Eh, oh, alright."
Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
"Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?"
"Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands."
"Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?"
Now what?
But it's down in the snow.
But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
"Alright, then."
Uh you did what?
"You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?"
"Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me."
Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
"Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go."
Boy it sure is dry out here.
I'm ba-ack!
"I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous."
"It seems like I might get splinters, though."
"Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast."
"I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus!"
It's a least a couple of hours.
I'm ba-ack.
I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus.
"Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle."
"Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long."
I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
"Oh, Jesus!!"
In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
"Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had-"
"Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!"
I'm back.
"Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there."
"Well, Kyle, I I gotta go."
"Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut."
"Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin."
"Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya."
Re- really?
"Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags."
"I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya."
Haha!
Aharmani Exchange?
"Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive."
What's a VHS?
Is that fun?
Alright.
"I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan!"
"Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy."
Right.
And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
And Cartman for being fat.
And Cartman for being stupid.
And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole
"No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy."
"Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss."
"Yeah, that was pretty good."
'K go!
"You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?"
"What, did he lose a hundred pounds?"
"Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!"
A trampoline?
...What?
I'm leaving right now!
"You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!"
"Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!"
"They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases."
...I hate you so much.
"Yeah, they're gonna get busted again."
"We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!"
"Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat."
"Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know."
Kenny's sick?
Wait. Kenny's going to die?
Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.
"They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die."
"Hey dude, how's it going?"
"Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude."
"Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?"
"Stan?  Stan, where are you going?"
"Dude, he needs us right now."
"I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!"
"Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!"
"Stan, you can't leave!"
Cartman?
"Cartman, were you... crying?"
"Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too."
"Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will."
"...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane!"
"Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny."
"Neat, huh Kenny?"
He said his wish is not to die.
"He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself."
He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
"He just said... ""Where's Stan?"""
"What, Cartman?"
"I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you."
AAARGH!
"Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken."
"Okay, Not-Kenny."
Dude! That's today!
Excuse me? Could we get through here?
Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
Them?
"Oh, ""A I D E S,"" aides."
"Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial."
"But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular."
"It matters, dude."
That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
Tha- that's diarrhea.
That's a great idea!
But Butters isn't fat.
Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
"Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast."
"Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters."
"You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise."
Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
Wow! He looks great!
Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
"Yeah, we're all set."
"Well, what do you mean?"
Wow!
"Yeah, you're still fat!"
Why are you doing this to us?!
"Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip."
"Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision."
The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat.
"Alright, it's working!"
It's out of control!
To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
Yep.
"Wow, that was pretty good."
We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.
"Uh, why not?"
Wait!  You're all making a mistake!
"Aw, just forget the whole thing then!"
"Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams."
"No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee."
What
"Go on, Ike."
"...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman."
...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.
"Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!"
What do you wanna do now?
"Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude."
You don't even know Heather!
"Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend."
I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches.
"Awgh, dude, I can't look."
"Good job, dude!"
"Mom, Dad!"
"Yeah, what a stupid sport!"
"Okay, Not-Kenny."
"This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!"
Cool!
Do you think they'll believe it?
Awesome!
But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
Yeah.
"Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!"
We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
"We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool."
That looks awesome!
Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.
"Yeah, he sure is."
This is gonna be awesome!
Wow!
Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
"Aw, dude."
"Then why the hell do they call it ""veal""??"
What??
Yeah.
"Come on, we've gotta go!"
"'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!"
What?!
"Screw you, Cartman!"
No!
Have Butters kiss it.
Awww!
Sick! I felt it on my face!
Hyaaaa!
You need to freeze some of your ass off.
What?
Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
"Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!"
Butters has that at his house?
All right!
"Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?"
"You're getting in pretty deep, dude."
So what happens now?
"We're with you, dude."
"We're with you, Stan."
...No I won't.
"Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!"
Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...
"Cartman, stay away from that door!"
"But we will have to sleep, dude."
Good night.
We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
"He might be right, dude."
All right!
Yeah! And fried chicken!
"We're eating, dude."
Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
"Dude, that's messed up."
"You guys, check this out!"
It is?
"Huh, what the hell is that?"
Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?
"Dude, are you okay?"
"Dude, maybe we should end this."
Don't give him anything!
Dude!
"Stan's getting worse, you guys."
Stan! It worked!
"They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!"
Mexico here we come!
"Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on."
Oh no! No!!
"Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan??"
"Whoa, dude."
"But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause."
Do we have everything?
"Look, it's almost time."
It's the biggest night of the year.
"Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway-"
You'd miss the new trailer?
Kyle.
"Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break."
"Dude, thank God for stupid people"
"Just don't mess with it, Cartman."
Just just leave it alone.
God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!
"God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!"
We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet.
"No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it!"
They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
"But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage."
"God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house."
"God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!"
"Heuh, the commercials!"
"Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show."
"Get it back to normal, Chef!"
The TV left.
We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
We're not too late!
They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!
"That'd disgusting, dude!"
"It's okay, it's still the show."
"Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it."
Will your sister let us watch it?
Look! Crack addicts with a television!
Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??
Well why not?!
This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
The last commercial break is starting!
What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!
They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see??
"It looks even better than their first movie, huh?"
Who wants to tell him?
Lame
"But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were."
"We're sorry, Butters.  Our mind is made up."
Phew.
"Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think."
Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
"Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high."
"But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes."
Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy
Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .
Tweek.
This looks pretty good.
"You're such a fatass, Cartman!"
Token.
Timmy.
Tweek.  Pip
Towelie.
Jimmy.
"Anything that'll impress us, Token."
"Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there."
Yeah! Isn't this great?!
"Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything."
"Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on."
So? You're a smartass!
Good point.
Cool.
Just stick it on.
Yeah.
"Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny!"
Yeah.
No way.
Nuh uh.
No way.
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars.
"Ah, alright."
"I told you, Cartman."
Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
"See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed."
Oh God!
"Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!"
We don't know who else to talk to.
"Wow, I guess this really is a big deal."
There's nothing here!
"Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright."
Ms. Choksondik stinks inside.
Quick. Hide.
Got it!
It is?
"Oh, really??"
I'm so glad we're not murderers.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Well what are you gonna do?
"Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman."
Huh.
Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us?
...Yeah. So?
Hey! It's Tweek.
The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
Hey dudes.
What are you guys doin'?
In your butts?
Why would he put anything in your butts?
Hm.
"Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation."
Yeah.
"Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!"
It wouldn't work!
I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
"You're on, fat boy!"
"Well, Cartman?"
"Well, go on, smartass, and do it!"
No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
Get the fuck out of here!
What?
"Go fuck yourself, Cartman!"
"Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!"
So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature!
"It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!"
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
So?
"Cartman, there's something I need to tell you."
"You were totally, one hundred percent right."
"You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend."
"No, dude. They only changed ""terrorist"" to ""hippie"" to make E.T. more P.C."
Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
"Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now."
"Yeah. We'll be the ""Save Films From Their Own Directors"" club"
"""Free hat?"""
"Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough."
"Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats."
We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
What?
Yah.
You?? Why?
Me.
"Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!"
We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
"Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children."
"Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!"
No. NOO!!
Nonono! We need to do this first.
We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
This looks like the right room.
That's it!
"Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark."
"...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart."
Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
"It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is."
You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
"When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society"
Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film!
What??
Yup.
"Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!"
Yeah. I I think so.
...What?
"Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice."
"She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay."
"Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her."
I don't know.
Dude! Bebe is really smart!
"Yeah, it's cool."
Yeah.
Yeah. She's really cool.
"That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-"
I'm showing her.
Hoh!
"Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-"
Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh!
Hah hah hah!
We were throwing rocks at cars.
Maybe she's in the lunch line.
Yep.
Right.
Yeah.
Huh??
"Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!"
No way! Tweek's cool!
I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
Hoh hoh hoh!
What the hell are you doing?
"Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today."
Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
Boobs are stupid!
It will.
So?
"Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!"
"But, wait. Where's the other team?"
"Dude, we weren't playing anybody."
"You're such a fatass, Cartman."
"Yeah, it was like four days ago!"
It was such a long time ago!
"Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember."
"Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny."
"We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??"
Yeah. Closure.
"There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny!"
"Alright, we made it!"
"Let him out, Cartman!"
Is he in there?
I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot!
Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
Goddamnit! There has to be a way!
"A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny."
Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
Cartman? Cartman?!
"Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!"
Maybe you got brain cancer.
"Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back."
Do you see anything?
Grandma??
Huh?
What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
HAAHH!!!
Hey Kenny.
You're too fat to be Kenny.
"What?? For God's sake, why??"
Are you gonna burn me?
Jesus Christ!
"You did, dude! You drank his whole body!"
"Yeah. Good job, fatass!"
We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!
"Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny."
"What do you mean, fatass?"
Do you see anything?
"Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home."
"Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now."
"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy."
"Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?"
"Stop him, Kenny!"
"That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!"
"But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?"
Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
"I'm a Paladin, Cartman!"
Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
"Gentlemen, we are off!"
The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
"Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings."
"Butters, what the hell are you doing?!"
"Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!"
This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
"Oh, crap, the sixth graders!"
You can't keep it.
"Dude, that video is making people act strange."
We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
Hide!
Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
"Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do."
We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.
This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.
Paladin!
We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
We were almost killed.
"Hey, what are you guys doing?"
You guys. Somebody is following us.
Butters?
"Jimmy, are you sure?"
They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
"Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost."
Oh brother!
"No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before."
Oh no! They're closed!
Finally.  It's over.
Butters! No!
It has to go back!
"Let go of the tape, Butters!"
Fine!
Middle-earth is again safe.
Funny.
Not him!
Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.
"Hey guys, can we talk to you?"
"Uhh, not cool."
"Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay."
"""Fat tits."" That's a good one."
Bad.
"Gays, I guess."
"Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass."
"We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef."
"Uh, a bear?"
"Eh I, I don't know what else to paint."
Aaaa!
People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
Oh.
Can't... glue... any... more.
"Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care."
"Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix."
"Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?"
We're gong to New York?
Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
We have a dead friend.
Yee-yeah.
I'm Kyle.
Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here?
Oh my God!
Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.
Four white birds!
There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
I'm not going back.
I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them.
"Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!"
He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
"You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever."
"Throw it away, Clyde!"
Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
...Where did you have sex with her?
Wow. That's pretty cool.
"'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows."
"Hey, what happens to me in the future?"
"What are you doing, Cartman?"
What's it?
That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
Mr. Hankey!
Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
Yeah.
Me neither.
"Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??"
Finally!
Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?
"Wow, cool!"
Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?!
"Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?"
What are you doing?
"Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!"
All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
"Jesus, behind you!"
You bastards.
"On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel."
"Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!"
Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!
"Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!"
"Dude, where have you been?"
Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with.
"Ah, damn it!"
"My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!"
"No, Ike! You can't come to school with me."
"Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!"
Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
Kick it!
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Really? What about?
Totally!
Yeah. This does seem really familiar.
"Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?"
You don't?
"Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car."
And then you said
Weird
Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
"What is a proc-tologist, Chef?"
What a dick!
Other than his monstrous size.
"And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it."
Are you okay?
"No way!  You do it, Kenny!"
I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
God-damnit Cartman!
Stop it Cartman!
God Dammit!
That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
No!
You're lying!
That does it! CHARGE!
It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
Candy bars?
Aaaah! Runrunruuun!
The aliens are chasing us!
I think we ditched them.
"What the? Where are, where are we?"
It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
Yeah.
"Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay."
No!
Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
Earth?
"You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up."
What?? Who cancelled us?
"Dude, we have to try!"
"Mighty powerful network executives,"
Please don't cancel us. Please.
"Oh my God, this is great!"
Kenny!
The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
What the hell is that?
"Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve."
"Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something."
What?
"Cartman, just stay out of it."
Yup. I'm not seeing anything.
Mee tooo.
A reindeer?
How dare she talk to us like that?!
TP her house?
Oh.
Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
"You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?"
Oh.  Uuugh.
"Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside."
So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
"We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!"
What have we done?
"We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble."
How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
"Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!"
Noo! No.  Noo!
Ah! Oh God! Oh God!
Oh God!
How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?
"Ah, Ah I, ah I thought..."
Why are they doing us one at a time?
I can get a better deal?
Noo! No.  Noo!
Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm!
I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
Oh. Okay. Thanks.
"Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now."
"What's this all about, Cartman?"
A boat ride?
"Well, okay."
Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
"I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!"
Cartman!
You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it!
They did?
Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
You con-fessed?
"You guys, we can't let him do this!"
"Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house."
Because it was-
"I still feel bad, Cartman"
Yeah. That makes it even worse.
I know.
We feel bad for other people.
"You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!"
"Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you."
We have to confess that we were the ones that-
Cartman??
That's not fair!
"But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!"
This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
"Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now."
Oh Jesus!
You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
"Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!"
What should we do?
Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?
"Uuuh, n-no blood for oil."
"Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!"
Shut up and study!
What are you doing?
"That isn't gonna work, dumbass!"
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying!"
"Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!"
Cartman? Cartman??
"No, turdpants, it's Kyle!"
"Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit!"
"Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!"
Cartman?  Cartman??
"Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!!"
"But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!"
"Oh, Jesus..."
God damnit!
Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
We didn't do our homework.
He does?
Cartman? Cartman saved the day?
I-I don't know.
I hate this town. I-I really really do.
"...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you."
Cool.
No way.
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
"No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!"
Stop it!
"Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!"
"She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!"
"Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!"
God dammit!
"Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!"
That's not what I meant!
"Can we go now, please?!"
"Stop it, Cartman!"
...What?
No!
"Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson."
Good.
"Aw, God-dammit!"
That does it. I'm out.
"Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!"
I hate you.
Come in.  COME IN!!
So stop doing it!
You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
"Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!"
I can see your lips moving!
See?! I just saw your lips move!
"Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!"
"Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!"""
"YES, dude!"
Out!
Oh Jesus.
"Oh no, no, nonono."
Stop. It.
"Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?"
"All right.  All right, I guess it's possible."
"Awww, shit!"
"Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea."
Really?
"Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am."
I think we can piece this case together now.
"Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory."
"Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet."
Then saw off the arms and legs.
"But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog."
We're in business!
Do you kow where your doll is?
"All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!"
But the window isn't locked.
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
"Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!"
"Yeah, but how?"
How... do you make semen come out?
"Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast."
What?  What??
They've got the doll!
What do we do now?
"Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people."
We've got to do something.
...Grrrr!!!
But they said we can't charge the front door.
"We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!"
Wow!
Ah... a a a meth lab?
"What is a meth lab, anyway?"
"Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it."
We're sorry.
"Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore."
"Better how, dude?"
We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.
"Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison."
"Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-"
No.
"Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble."
"Uh, it's okay. We know the owner."
"Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat."
Certainly.
"That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners."
"What is Native American comedy, anyway?"
"Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go."
I said I wanna leave.
"What?? No, no, I mean, I-"
Native Americans.
Dog parade?
How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
"The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand."
What the hell are they doing??
You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
"Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for."
What?! Get the hell out of here!
Hey dudes.
What?
"Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear."
"Hi Mom, Hi Dad!"
"I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen!"
Thanks.
"Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual."
"I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me."
Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
Stan?
No! Ah!
I got beat up at school... for being different.
No! For not being a metrosexual.
Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?
Gah! Just leave me alone!
GRRRRR!!
That does it! I know what I have to do!
"One ticket to New York, please."
I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?
I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
I thought of it first!
Did so! Did so!
I thought of it two days ago!
Cool.
Clear!
They aren't gay? Then what are they?
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!"
No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help!
Mom!
What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
"...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?"
God-damnit!
"He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz."
I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
Christian rock?!
"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!"
"Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!"
"You're on, fat boy!"
What a stupid asshole!
"Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?"
Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
"Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops."
"Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!"
Aaaargh!
It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
Really?
"All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder."
Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome!
I don't know.  Let me go check.
I don't know!
"Um, sir-"
We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
What's the matter with him?
"We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh..."
"So, he's gonna get it, right?"
"No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!"
"Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!"
"We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!"
"You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!"
"You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!"
Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
"Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!"
"You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!"
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop.
"That's us!  ""Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."""
"""We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha.""  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album."
He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
"Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening."
"From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?!"
Oh.
"I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say ""Congratulations. You were right"" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it."
"Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars."
This is the worst day of my life.
"Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!"
"You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!"
It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
"Dude, look!"
I don't know.
"Dude, is that your dad?"
I can't understand him.
Why are they all out driving at the same time?
Aah! There's another one!
"Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside."
They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
"We can't fight them, Cartman."
Country Kitchen Buffet?
"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!"
"Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?"
You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
"No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!."
It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
Who said I'm inviting you?
Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
"I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one."
Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
"Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! ""I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm."" ""Fuck off, Cartman!"""
"You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you."
"Sorry, my mind's made up."
I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go."
"That isn't it, Cartman."
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
I know you don't.
Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice?
"Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday!"
Well?
How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
"Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did."
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?"
"That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too."
"And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place."
Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
"Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally!"
"Oh. Thanks, dude."
Oh wait. Cartman.
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
"All right, let's go."
Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
"Aw dude, weak."
"Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing."
"Nah, I can't. We should help look for him."
Yeah. And then we can try the football field.
"Yeah, it's pretty cool."
"Oh, awesome."
What?
What?
I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
"It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute."
Cartman!
Cartman!
Jesus Christ!
"Oh, dude, what a little asshole!"
"Dude, that new kid is such a douche!"
"Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!"
What are they doing?
What happened?
You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
"Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?"
Wow!
"Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?"
Oh no...
"Dude, this is unbearable."
"Aw dude, this is really hard."
"Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing."
D'awww sick!
Oh God...
Yeah. This is really their fault.
Who's Rob Reiner?
"You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke."
"Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?"
Oh no...
"But... isn't that, kind of, lying?"
What??
"So, tobacco helped to build America."
That sound perfectly reasonable.
"But dude, you're making stuff up."
"Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!"
"This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something."
Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
"No, we really want nothing more to do with these people."
What are you doing?
"Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous."
Who's going to kill you?
"Yeah dude, don't get us killed too."
"No dude, get away!"
Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!
Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.
No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
"Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!"
God-damnit!
"No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it."
"You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!"
No.
"No we didn't, dude! No we didn't!"
Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan?
Why?
"Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework."
"God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up."
"'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you."
"No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic."
"Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live."
"Dude, not now!"
"Jeez, he's worse than I thought."
No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
"What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?"
"Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me?"
"Hey. Uh, this is Stan."
"Okay. Okay, come on you guys."
"Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there."
What are you doing?
"Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball."
"Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?"
"Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!"
"Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!"
"God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!"
"Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!"
"Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!"
Yeah. She is.
Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
"Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!"
What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
"Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back."
No Ike! Shh!
Ike's not my little brother anymore?
"Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?"
"You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-"
"Guys.  Guys, I need your help."
"It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone."
"Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying."
"I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-"
What?
Is that true?
"I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money."
"It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this."
We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
"Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines."
"Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible."
Four.
How about fifty daura?
Fifty-five daura.
Okay. Sixty daura.
Okay.
Got it.
Why not?
"You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid."
All right! We're going to Canada!
"Hey, where the hell are you going??"
I'm trying!
No.
Hey! We're in Canada!
"Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?"
Who's that?
"Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?"
So how do we get to Ottawa?
Word!
Who are you?
"That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves."
French Canada?
We don't have time for this.
Hello?
"Okay, you can come with us."
"God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!"
"Can we just get going, please?"
There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
Well come on!
Do you think we can still make it in time?
We need to see the new Prime Minister.
No. No!!
"Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me."
Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back.
Really?
"Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-"
Ike!
"Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything."
But why are you making such strange laws??
"You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!"
What the hell??
"Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back."
"Dude, come on."
"Stop it, Cartman!"
"Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me!"
"Wow, cool."
"Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude."
Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
Kaii yo!
"Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble."
"No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them."
"You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!"
I still say this is a bad idea.
But don't tell anybody we have them.
"Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next."
"God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!"
No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
"That doesn't count, fatass!"
Who the hell is that?
Whoa.
"Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto!"
"Okay, okay, you can have your powers back."
God dammit Cartman!
"What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!"
Oh man! We are in serious trouble!
I agree with Cartman!
You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!
"If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened."
"God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again."
Oh no.
"That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!"
We need some more fur.  I think that's good.
"We've gotta hurry, it's getting late!"
"Quick, hide Butters!"
"He said, not now, Craig!"
I swore to never fight again.
Oh no. Butters!
"Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!"
Butters!
"Dude, look!"
"Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?"
"Yeah, we know."
Butters!
"It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence!"
"Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything."
"We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!"
"Screw you, fatass!"
I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
"Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!"
Where?!
Then it's not too late!
We have to get past them!
You have that power too?
"Oh dude, we are gonna get it now."
"Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?"
"Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!"
"Yeah, I c- I can't believe it."
So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
"Yeah, that'd be cool."
"Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys."
"...You're an asshole, Cartman."
What?
"Oh no. Cartman, no!"
Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
Because!
God damn you!
"No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics."
"It says right there ""a parent has to be with you to sign up,"" and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha!"
"Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive."
"I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!"
"I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!"
I came here to talk about you!
I'm a Vulcan!
"The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing."
No! I'm on the away team too!
I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge.
No it doesn't.
"No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!"
"Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!"
He does not!
Naw uh!
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
People don't hate the Jews!
...You're a stupid asshole!
One please.
"Yeah, I know, but I have to-"
...Thanks.
Haaaah!
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
"You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know."
"You were, you were right?"
You were right.
Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh!
"Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over."
"Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord."
"Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night."
But how can the Jews make it better??
"Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father."
"Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus."
"If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it."
I saw The Passion!
"Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!"
"No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!"
Look out!!
"Dude, what's wrong with him?"
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
"Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche."
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump.
"Hey, who are those kids?"
...What the hell just happened?
Yeah.
"Dude, that is a sweet RC car!"
"We're not interested, thanks."
Yeah! Go Stan!
All right Stan!
Yeah! You got served!
That's right!
"What the hell are you doing, fatass?"
Why?
Why?
"Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top."
"Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago."
Hey Look!
Hey. Do you live here?
"Dude, he must be loaded! What does he do?"
What's wrong with his face?
"Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up."
Mr. Jefferson?
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
"Dude, what happened to your knee?"
Mr. Jefferson!
"Mr-&#160;! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up."
"Alright, this is gonna sting for a second."
"I know, I know. Be cool."
"So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?"
And where is your mom?
"You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?"
What?
So you never met your mom?
"Yeah. Yeah, that counts."
"You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid."
"Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one."
They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
"Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard."
He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
What?!
"Come on, Blanket."
That poor kid.
"Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?"
"Jesus Christ, dude!"
"Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!"
"All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude."
I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on!
"Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay?"
"Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us."
You bastard!
Come on!
"Hang on, Blanket!"
"All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!"
All right! Things just might work out!
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
All you ever do is talk about your balls!
"If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!"
Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
Dude.
What?!
"Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!"
"Aw, dude."
This is really gay.
"Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Giant Douche."""
Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.
"It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in ""Giant Douche!"" It's way funnier!"
"Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?"
"Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?"
"That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche."
You hate Butters.
"You misled him, fatass!"
"Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier."
A giant douche.
Giant douche.
A giant douche.
"All right, it's decided. Let's all write in ""Giant Douche."""
Cartman? What the hell?!
"You won't get more votes than us, asshole!"
Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.
Giant Douche is your man!
"Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich."
There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
"What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!"
"Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy."
"You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?"
"Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part."
"Woah... wait, what are you doing?"
"No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich."
"...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche."
"Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!"
"Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!"
"Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche."
"Ha! You lose, fatass!"
"That is fucking stupid, Cartman!"
Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
"You only need one copy, r-tard!"
"Okay, fine, I will!  H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop!"
"Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night."
"Why, Mr. Farkle?"
"Cartman, stop it!"
"See?! That sucks, dude!"
"Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the-"
What the hell?
Butters? What the hell are you doing?
But you run the Wall-Mart.
"You hate Wall-Mart, too?"
"No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility."
It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.
"Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?"
"How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?"
Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!
But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!
"Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!"
No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
"Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, ""Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along"" or something."
"All right, fine. Come on, fatass!"
I heard that!
You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
God-damnit!
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
We want to talk to who's in charge.
So how do we stop it?
The heart of Wall-Mart?
"All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home."
"All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it."
I knew you were!
"Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!"
"Yes, I did!"
"Yes, I did!"
"Yes, I did!"
Yes. I did!
-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-
"We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us!"
We've gotta find the television department.
I think I see the television department in the back!
Who are you?
Where's the heart?
"The question is, ""Where is the heart?"""
We'd better get out of here.
The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out now!
All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
Duh.
"Okay, hang on a second I-"
"All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you?"
Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?!
"Oh, no! No!"
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
Yeah.
"Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool"
"Totally, dude, let's play Fireman."
"Shut up, fatass!"
"Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool!"
Do you know how to start a fire?
We're firemen!
Code 7! Bring in the firemen!
We saved the school!
My mom is gonna break my legs!
Not us. We're good kids.
"Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!"
"We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!"
"Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it."
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
"Dude, we shouldn't be here!"
We need you to protect us... from a bully.
"Well...  Well, what do you want?"
Wait! We'll do it.
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
What else has big round squishy globes?
"No, the nipples are more in the middle, see?"
Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.
"God, I hope this works."
"Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?"
Naw.
"Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!"
"Oh, Jesus. You told him that?!"
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
So you're gonna help us?
"The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids."
"Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you!"
"Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!"
"Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit."
What?!
"Geez, all that from a stupid video show."
"Gah, I just don't get it."
"Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!"
How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.
Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.
Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.
"Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle."
We're making the news more appealing to students.
We beat Close-up Animals!
"Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig."
"What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no."
Thee... uhhh. What if the-?
Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!
That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.
How do we know which one to use?
It's not?
"Oh, okay."
"All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise."
"Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right?"
Me too.
I could watch this for days.
Ah!
"Butters, get away from me!"
I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.
"Jesus, you may be right."
"So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested!"
Twenty-two people?! All right!
"Dude, bail?"
What's going on?
Do it! Do it!
"Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!"
"Awww, go on and do it already!"
"Cartman, what did you do?!"
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
"Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!"
You don't have any powers!
He can't do crap!
Ha! You see?!
What?!
This is fuckin' ridiculous!
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
Hey! What about this guy?!
"Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!"
"Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man."
No.
Why won't anybody listen to me?!
"I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman."
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
"All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it!"
"I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m."
"No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard."
Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.
What the hell?
My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
"Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus."
No. I'm Jewish.
Huh?
"Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!"
"No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!"
"With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!"
"Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!"
"Oh, stop it, Cartman!"
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
"Dude, why do you care?!"
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
"All right, fine!"
"HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the --  Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this!  I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!"
"Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist."
"Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there."
"Goddammit, Cartman!"
How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
"I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman!"
Yeah?
Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
Oo whataya mean?
I know. I deserve it.
"You're right.  Jesus, that was fun..."
But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do.
Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?
"But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?"
Yeah. That's right.
Totally! I totally understand!
"Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one."
"Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?"
"No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black."
I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
Yeah!
Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black.
Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery.
"Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??"
But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
"Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside."
Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
But Jews can't play basketball!
I'm never speaking to either of you ever again!
"Yeah, but it was totally worth it."
"Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!"
"Alright, Dad!"
"Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play."
"Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?"
"All right!  Dad, I can play!"
"I'm a hundred percent ready, coach!"
All right!  Ow. Hm.
I got it! I got the ball.
But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
"Hey, let's ask them."
Wha- whataya mean?
Ugh! Those dirty liars!
"Yeah, we're pissed off."
"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!"
You said it!
"Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em."
"Yeah, it's called a town."
You're doing what?
We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
"Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us."
How come we never get opportunities like that?
We're not talented?
Probably.
Why?
Can I talk to you?!
What the hell are you doing?!
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
Yes he does!
"Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!"
"Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you."
"Welcome to the team, Token."
We knew you could do it!
Twenty dollars.
"Mister, you can't do this to us!"
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
"Sir, we would love to sign your wife."
"Jesus, we made it just in time!"
Oh crap!
"Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-"
"Aw, just forget it!"
Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
"Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?"
"Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?"
Let's do it Wing!
"Oh my God, dude!"
What?
Get out!
Woohoo! Yeah!
What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
Wing?
Wing?
They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
"Damn, CAA is pretty impressive."
You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
"You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!"
"Dude, maybe we should give up!"
Cartman!
Wing?
Stupid talent agents!
"All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!"
They killed Kenny!
She had a contract with us first! We own her!
Her life belongs to us!
Yeah.
Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.
Me too.
Token?
That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
Wuh what'd I do?
"Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell."""
Kenny had a will?
That's... really touching.
Oh my God!
Kenny! You're alive!
He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
He did not!
Did not!
Cartman!
Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!
That dirty no-good sonofabitch!
How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
"Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!"
"Yeah, come on!"
"We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!"
"You say tomato, but I say Kenny!"
"Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace."
"Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons."
"Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone."
"This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home."
"Aw God, I'm so borrred."
"Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season!"
No more boring baseball until next year!
Nobody said anything about a post-season.
I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
"You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport."
You hate this game too?
"No, we're gonna get creamed!"
"Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base."
Crud!
We're so proud of you kids!
What?
"Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game."
I know who.
"There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play."
"Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team."
You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
Aw crap!
Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
"Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long."
Get up! You have to fight!
"God, this is gonna be sooo yummy."
She's here!
I want some!
"Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good."
"All right, let's eat Colonel!"
The skin's the best part...
You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
Hello?? I've been saying this for years!
"Yes, but he thrives on that."
That sounds great!
Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
Thanks.
We're ignoring him.
Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
"He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle."
"We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have."
"Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy."
"I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?"
"Huh wuh, what's the matter?"
Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
"Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen."
Huh?
How do you know that?
George Bush?
Terrorists?
Communists?
Chinese radicals?
...Cartman?
Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!
"Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now."
"Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside."
How?
We can't get out! The flames are too big!
"Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us!"
"Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!"
"Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!"
What are you doing?
What gold??
"No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!"
Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
"Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!"
"Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!"
"...Okay, fine! Here!  Now let's go!"
What are all you guys doing here?
The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
That's a pretty solid idea. But who?
"Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there."
"Jesus, what are they doing in there?"
"Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong."
Can you see anything?
Wait! I don't wanna know that!
"I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass!"
It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
Hello? Oh hey dude.
"Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A."
I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
Why?
Who?
"Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked."
"Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?"
"It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg."
At who?  Heh- hang on.
Huh?
"Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!"
"Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!"
"Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;"
"Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade.  Freakin' weirdos, man."
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
"Dude, it's totally fine."
"Dude, did you hear what's happening?"
Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
"She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?"
"Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!"
Impress Wendy??
What the hell are you talking about?!
Stan?
"Stan? Stan, I think we should talk."
"Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!"
I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
"Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend."
"Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either."
"It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me."
Yeah dude. I'm sorry.
Yeah. And I can still get my A!
Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?
"Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!"
Don't fail us! We'll be right there!
Thanks dude!
Keep running!
Hang on! Wait!
Gays can get married? What??
What did we do?
What?!
"That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!"
This is all a bunch of crap!
"It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!"
"Fine, I will!"
Stupid supremacist asswipe!
"What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?"
Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
"We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles."
But it's... it's not true they... have no souls.
I just had a couple more questions about-
"And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you."
Thanks Butters
"Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch."
There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
Hey.  That's a great idea!
Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
"Wow, Cartman. You look... different."
Is that an umbrella you're using?
"...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?"
"Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one."
"Dude, this is going awesome."
"Dude, check it out."
"We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers."
I don't believe it.
"Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer."
"Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!"
"Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!"
Are you in?
Oh... hey there.
Let's just... let's just walk this way.
"Yeah, good idea."
Kenny!
In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door!
Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we?
"Oh Jesus, I should have known!"
Cartman! I need to tell you something!
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
"You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman."
"Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer."
"How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?"
So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
"Yeah dude, nothing fun is free."
Yeah. See ya.
"Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies."
"Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into."
"Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times."
What secret truth??
I didn't know you were depressed.
"Dude, Jambu is the best!"
Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
"Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him."
I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
"Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu."
Who said that?
No way!
South Park.
What do you wanna talk about?
Rocket ships?
Why? Aren't you happy here?
This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this!
Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
"Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!"
I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out!
"Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?"
"He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!"
"Goddammit, say something!"
"Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?"
Sick?
Oh my God...
That's terrible!
"Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,"
"The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work."
"Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?"
Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
"Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?"
Stan?
"Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here."
"Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money."
"I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away."
You can? Awesome!
Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
They want twenty million dollars.
"All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all."
"I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project."
"Okay ma, thanks!"
"Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?"
Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
"Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??"
Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
"Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy."
"Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!."
Huh?
"You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!"
"No! Please, we have to go!"
"But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried."
All right!!
It belongs with its family!
"Tijuana, Mexico!"
"You're going home, Willzy-x!"
"Willzy-x, I think we're here."
"Come on, guys!"
"Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you."
"Get him in the water!  Goodbye, Willzy-x!"
We did it!
"All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing."
"I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle."
"Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon."
"He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?"
Are you sure you're all right?
"Dude, I think you're being followed."
"No, dude, it's the police."
I think his pants are falling down.
"You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30."
