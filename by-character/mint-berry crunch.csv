"Sit back, justice believers, and listen to another edition of America's favorite superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch!  Our story begins in a remote corner of the Gulf of Mexico.  The BP Oil Company drills into the ocean floor,  but they drill too much, and the BP Oil Company accidentally unleashes Cthulhu, an ancient evil god from another dimension. Halfway across the country,  a mild-mannered attractive fourth-grader, Bradley Biggle, hears of the disaster on the news while with his friends.  But Bradley Biggle is no ordinary fourth-grader! Not long ago, he realized he had superpowers he could call upon by turning in place and saying the magic word, ""Shablagoo!"" And in a flash, Bradley is transformed into the thrilling superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch! Joined by the other Coon Friends, Mint-Berry Crunch went to investigate the Gulf spill crisis! The superheroes came across a cult, in existence for years, that had been waiting for Cthulhu's arrival. They are the key to stopping Cthulhu from taking over the world! Sometimes, when everything seems hopeless, that's when you need to bring it all.  That's when you need... to bring the Crr-runch!"
Rrright!
The power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch!
Nono. Mint-Berry Crunch doesn't ever pee his pants!
Is he? Oh Jesus!
A what?
A double rainbow? Shablagoo!
Waaaaaaaaaah!
"And so, the Coon had returned with the dark lord Cthulhu! Upon seeing Cthulhu in person, Mint-Berry Crunch heroically dashed off, to, to save the day! With Minty coolness he hurried back home! And heroically watched Judge Judy, knowing that his superhero friends were probably just fine without him!"
"Ahaaa! Don't worry, Mysterion. Mint-Berry Crunch is here to help you with these black cultists!"
"Mint-Berry Crunch isn't afraid of his fat sister! Grab her legs, Mysterion!  M- Mysterion?  Aw crap."
"Hey Mysterion, wait up!  Come on, wait uuup!  Us Coon Friends need to stick together remember? Where are you going?"
What? But he'll kill you.
Oh right. Maybe I can find the reason for my powers too.
"How was it that mint and berry came together delivering full flavor in an intense crunch?  We must find out answers Mysterion.  Mu-Mysterion, I'm going with you."
"Mysterion, no! What are you doing?!"
"...Uh yes. Yes, please go on."
Wow!
"I will, father. No more running away for... Mint-Berry Crunch!  Hello, Cthulhu, I heard you haven't been ""berry"" nice!  Not enough, huh? Maybe the intense flavor of mint will freshen things up!"
"I reached the Gulf of Mexico in no time, and with all my strength, I dragged Cthulhu back to the depths from whence he came! My trusty hero companions were there, still alive. I returned them to their world encased in a protective berry bubble. Then it's back down to fill up the hole created by the BP Oil Company, returning home only momentarily to flip off my fat sister."
"Oh no, we worked as a team! All the Coon and Friends stopped the BP drilling spill crisis."
"Well, I'm off. There are still many more questions left unanswered. I need to know what happened to my parents."
I will. Shaaablagoo!
