"Peter!  Oh God, Harry! It's our son!  Peter, it's Mommy."
"So we put him up for adoption. But as the years passed, I, I just felt an emptiness in my heart.  Oh it's so good to see him."
"I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter, we came to take him back."
Yes!
"Peter, you must come with Mommy and Daddy."
Perhaps we were wrong to try and take Peter back. He doesn't belong here. He belongs with his family.
"Me neither. Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on!"
Hello.
Oh I agree. There are so many of us who are moved by The Passion. It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community.
"Wha- what does that mean, sweetie?"
"Well, what does that mean, dear?"
"Oh, this is fun!"
It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.
