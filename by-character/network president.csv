"Look, I'm not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network. Let's just forget aboat it, okay guys?  Aw, come on guys, give me a break."

"I doubt it! I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled."
That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out.

"Eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! You know, women empowerment and the get-go. So we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale!"
"Terrance and Phillip, you've put on a terrific show for many many years. You've made Canada Channel what it is today. You're fired."
"Sorry guys, but this queefing thing is really catching on.  Queef Sisters' ratings are through the roof, and to pay them what they're asking we've gotta get rid of you. Goodbye. Here's some cookies."
