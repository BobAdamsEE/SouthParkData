"...Not anymore, you're not!"
Can't we? You guys are playing Detective. We're playing FBI. That gives us jurisdiction over you!
I want choppers on the roof ready to go!
Good. Then you can help us by telling me everything you know.
Attention! You in the house!  This is Agent Tucker with the FBI! We have you surrounded. Sort of.
"And you did a great job leading us here. Now you just stay out of our way!  The gig is up, Fosse! Bring out the doll! Or we'll tell on you!"
No you're not.
"Time out, kid! We say you can't charge the front door, and you have to obey what the FBI says! That's the rules!"
Yes it does so!
Come on guys. You don't wanna hurt that doll.
