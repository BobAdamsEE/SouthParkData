"Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!"
...But I hate you.
He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!
"Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30."
"...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir."
I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice!
With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice?
How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!
"Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later."
Yeah. That's true.
"You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny."
"Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it!"
"All right, let's do this!"
He had cooties and he lied about it!
I thought I was the only one.
"He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say ""shitballs"" to the principal I'd be sooo happy."
"If I could say ""asspussy"" to the counselor I would be sooo happy."
"If I could yell ""tampon dickshit"" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy."
"If I could say ""titty sprinkles"" on national television I would be sooo happy."
"Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy."
"Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?"
No way.
Dude.
He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.
"Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play."
"Dude, this game rules."
"Dude, what's the matter with him?"
"Oh man, I can't watch this."
How was that cheating!
They did it!
So who do they say is the cutest?
You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
You don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom?
We got the list from the girls!
"Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I?"
"Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso!"
Could somebody toss the football back? Its over there next to the ugly kids.
Nothing!
These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs.
"Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off."
Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?
"Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow."
"All right, let's DO IT!"
"No, it's true. We've always hated you."
What?
...Fine.
...Yeah.
What do you guys want?
You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.
I'll go get the money.
"""Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole."""
"Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys."
"Can we please just go home, sir?"
"Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said ""Hey, you know? This plan might backfire.""  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes."
I'm being a dick?
"You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?"
That would be great. Thank you.
"My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars.  I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house  and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band.  They promised I would double my money in one afternoon.  But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami.  We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru.  And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money."
"Oh, that's awesome."
This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.
"That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world."
Stuff just happens.
You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.
You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.
"""Let's see what's in there."" That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say ""Let's see what's in there."""
What?
I have no idea.
I don't know.
No.
I'm not following you guys any more.
Why?
"Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because ""that's just the way it is."""
I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.
It's easy. Watch.
No.
...Nope.
"Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it."
I didn't say anything.
"Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See?"
"Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes."
"My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains.  Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed.  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen."
"The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security.  My parents were sooo happy.  I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.  We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money."
Peru.
"Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend."
I've been waiting for this all week.
"Dude, I was here first."
Then just give him half.
"I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half."
"Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon."
Just give him half.
That's right.
"Can we have some food, please?"
Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.
Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it.
"Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right."
It's awesome.
"Oh, that's a good idea."
"Please sir, it's very important."
Get out of here.
"Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids."
I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.
"Hey. Hey, I got one.  Why do girls wear makeup and perfume?"
'Cause they're ugly and they stink.
Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.
Game on!
"Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper?"
"Hey, here's a post about Token: ""Token Black's Private Gym Photos"""
Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.
"""In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'."""
It's not somebody in this room.
"Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: ""Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker.""  Yeah. Hey wait, that's me."
Huh?
It's a rat!
There's no telling. It could be about any of us.
Nothing broke on the Web site yet.
Yeah. We're paying for your being fat.
"Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?!"
Where's our five dollars?
It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.
What are you talking about?
"Hey, did you see today's newspaper?"
You guys made the front page.
"Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday."
Jewpa what?
"Okay.  So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?"
So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.
"Yeah, life sucks sometimes, but it'll pass."
Yeah. Boooo!
"Oh, we have a new cheerleader?"
Where?
Hey yeah.
"Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth."
"Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet."
"It just looked like you cut it off, that's all."
"We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too."
"Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me."
He ate it!
Ohhhh.
...The truth about what?
"...Aahhhh, no, I don't think so."
...Okay.Â 
"Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no."
Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.
I have no idea.
It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
"I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!"
Where did you find a red-haired cow?
"Wow, that's pretty trippy."
I gotta show this to my mom!
"Dude, what the hell are you talking about?"
Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.
"Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real."
"Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones?Â "
I thought we were getting Playstation 4's.
Right. Let's all get PS4s.
That's exactly how XBox people are!
"We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!"
"Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us!Â "
"Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well."
They're still undecided.
"We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing."
"Wow, Kenny's a Japanese princess."
At Red Robin?
So how do we take over Black Robin?
Haha.
"Hey, that could work."
"Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl."
"Hey Clyde. Nice score, dude."
"Yeah, but did you see Token's girlfriend?Â "
What are you guys doing here?
But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
"You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves."
Are you guys making this up?
All the pizza we can eat?
"All right, this better be good."
You call this a party?! Your party sucks!
I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.
"Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?"
"Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party."
Occupied.
You can't call dibs on a toilet.
Whoa..
What are you talking about?Â 
For what?
Where was all this?
I know.
...I don't know.
No.
No I didn't.
No.
No.
He did?
Why would he say that?
"Well, I've gotta go over there and-"
Okay.
Red Racer's on.
I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
Nope.
What?! What did he say about Stripe?!
"That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!"
After Red Racer.
"Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow."
Some kid.
"Yeah, don't just ""Oh"" me!"
I uh...
What do we do?
I've never been in a fight before.
Meatloaf?
"Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!"
How can I resist an ass so great?
"This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master."
Okay.
"Okay, okay!"
Respect my authority.
Ugh.
What was on the news?
Huh?
I'm gonna kick your ass!
This girl touched my thigh.
Um...  Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.
Incriminate.
"Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball."
"Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!"
"Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!"
"Enjoying your lunch, nerdo?"
Get him!
"Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole."
"That's the point, buttpipe."
"Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid!  Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
Oh my God!
No! He's my friend!
No you don't!
What?
You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?
"This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line."
Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.
Craig.
It's Spaceman Craig.
"Take that, kindergartners!"
Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them.
I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
"...Come on, we wanna see the ass people."
Don't you have a VHS of it?
"Ha, that guy's a pussy."
"Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb."
What's going on?
Oh.
I don't know. Why?
Yeah. It kinda does.
Urh urh urh!
"That's true, huh? Man, that makes me really reflect on my pet."
"Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you."
Yeah!
Sure is!
Hah hah hahah hah!
Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be?
"I'm sorry for fighting, you guys."
It could hold a mental spell of some kind.
You're too young.
Only the six of us are to go?
Look out!
We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close.
What? That's stupid.
Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids.
"Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?"
You guys look pretty gay.
"Not as gay as us, though."
Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay!
"Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags!"
HA! Told you you guys were straight!
"I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite."
"Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there."
"Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!"
Take your non-flaming ass to some other school!
Everyone knows it's true!
Is so!
Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.
"Yeah, little bitch!"
Where'd you get those?
"Uh-uh, they're not that cool."
"Aha!  There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got!"
"At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead."
"So,  how would you ninjas like to do battle?"
You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor!
"I am not Craig,  I am Ginza,  with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!"
Lose who?
Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding?
"Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!"
To hell with that!
Butters!
Butters!
Butters! Where the hell are you?!
You guys!  You guys!
It's Butters! We saw 'im!
Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.
Butters is right on the other side.
No way.
I believe in Mr. Jefferson!
Yeah!
Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle Lens.
Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.
"Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows."
"This much more than you had!  Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me!"
"Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals."
"You wanted to see me, Mr. Meryl?"
I wouldn't if I were you.
Can't believe it.
Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us!
All the other teams are worse than us.
But who?
He's perfect.
"Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you?"
It's occupied.
What?
I... don't believe it.
Let's go take it!
He got it! He got the device!
I wanna use it.
"You shut up, asshole."
Maybe we should take it so someplace safer.
You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.
"Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking."
Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.
...So it's true.
That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?
