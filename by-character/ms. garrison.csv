"Okay children, let's take our seats. Now I know that we're all still in deep, deep mourning over the tragic death of our classmate, Butters."
But we all must try to move on. And so I'd like you to help me welcome a new student who was just moved here from Dallas. Children please say hello to... Marjorine.
"Why don't you tell the children a little bit about yourself, Marjorine?"
"Now Marjorine, that's not very ladylike. Us Colorado girls love to get pounded in the snootch just like any woman, but we keep it to ourselves."
"All right, have a seat, Marjorine. I'm sure all the other girls will be happy to show you around the school.  Won't you, girls?"
