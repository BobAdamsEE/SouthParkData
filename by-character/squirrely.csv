"Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star."
"You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!"
There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in.
This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever!
Is it gone?
Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.
"Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny!"
He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!
"Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness."
Blood orgy!
Hail Satan.
"The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into."
"Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human."
"Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion."
Hail Satan.
"The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest."
