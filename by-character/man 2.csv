"You in here, Peter?"
Yeah.
They did it!
Ogh!
Nissse
"Hey, it is him."
You homeless or homeowners?
Heard about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.
"Well, that was easy."
Oh my God.
"Canada, on strike."
What's the matter?
"No, don't. You're wasting your time."
Because we just came from there! There was nothing! Not one scrap of Internet!
"Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeño poppers."
"Very cultural, yes."
"To me it looked like Mysterion to me. Everyone who's seen Mysterion, say yeah!"
This is the first guy to actually make sense.
"Mmm, Chipotle."
Look out for the pee!
Are you okay?
Well what are we gonna do now?
"Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others."
"Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request?"
"Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess!"
I'll take ten lemon bars.
"You'll never stop him, you know."
"The Great One.  Cthulhu. He has risen, and soon all will be under his rule. It has all been foretold in the Necronomicon.  Hail Cthulhu! The darkness of the mythos is finally here.  Oh man, these are really good lemon bars."
"Biggest party in the world, baby!"
"If I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first!"
I certainly don't understand kids' music today. Sounds like diarrhea to me.
How long was it?
"Sounds like a dream, bro."
"Don't bro down against Sondheim, Randy! It's suicide!"
"Professor Lamont, we need to talk."
"You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont."
"Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?"
We're having a hard time following you here.
You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?
Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!
"Sorry we made you wait, everybody."
I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again?
I'd like to know about the biology of the trees.
Yes.
Could you get another picture of us?
Skip a free lunch? Not me!
"Rrrgh it's like, I can't explain it. I just suddenly feel like this isn't right."
"Ohh wow, it's the Avengers!"
"Oho, and Honey Boo Boo!  Kids, come see the green Honey Boo Boo costume!"
"All right, I'm next! I'm next! Get this thing off of me!"
Give me a break!
I'm betting on the Devil!
"Oh, yeah!"
Me-ee!
"Oh, where can I hide this big pipe?"
We've got to find those kids!
We can do it!
It's out of control!
You bastard!
Ohh! Noo!
Is it contagious?
"Well, that's about it. Let's go."
"And what about little Laura, the Williams' kid? If she doesn't get that heart-valve operation, she could die.  Yeah! Yeah, that's right!"
Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer!
Yep.
It's a UFO!
"Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!"
Hey! What's that guy doing?!
Yeah.
Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah!
All-natural cell phones!
"Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday."
Saturday is perfect for me.
Mm hmm.
"Oh, march? What are we marching for?"
…Oh.
See you later.
No doubt about it...
Do it again!
Woohoo!
"Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls."
Boring.
Do you know where this shit goes?
That's right.
Cover! Cover!
Whazzat?
Huh?
Oh my God!
"Yeah, I had the minnestrone over here."
"Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching."
Yeah!
Wait! Look!
"Ogh, that is so courageous."
"Hey, whoa now. John Edward is for real."
Well then how'd you know her birthday was in November?
Do me next. I wanna talk to my mother.
My God. We're famous!
"Jennifer, We love you Jennifer!"
"Yeah! I mean, there were children watching that auction! And when that little eight-year-old boy walked up and flashed his... penis! It was an outrage!"
I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.
And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.
We're in the moving business! Fourteen years we've been workin' our butts off! Now these future folk come in and we can't get work nowhere! They took our jobs!
"Yeah, they took our jobs!"
"Need help across the street, Ms. Claridge?  Well all right then."
This is a really nice town you have here. That's why the corporations are trying to use you to take it down.
What the hell are you doing?!
Right now we're proving we don't need corporations. We don't need money. This can become a commune where everyone just helps each other.
"No no, can't you imagine a place where people live together and like, provide services for each other in exchange for their services?"
"Hey, what happened to the tunes, man?"
This is killing my buzz.
"We all have BFFs, and we believe that a BFF is the highest legal authority."
Yeah! George Bush doesn't care about beavers!
"Well uh, we were thinkin' we would, you know, just go appeal to the Governor."
There he is!
Huh?
"Space, sн. Fly."
"Follow, sí, show yo.  The roque lunar?"
"Sí, fly."
Sí.
O-ah... Two hundred.
Two hundred... dollars.
You have to admit you're an alcoholic.
It is a disease because it's a physical dependency. That makes it a disease.
