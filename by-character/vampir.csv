"Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now."
You can't; it's too close to Vampir.
"Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se."
"Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se."
"Ummm, what are you doing?"
"That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se."
Tommy Petros? Is he cool?
All right.
"We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se."
That's Vampir Makowski now.
Of course not. Smoking's bad for you.
"You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se."
"...All mortals share a soft repose,
My soul doth dreadful vigils keep,
More keen than which hell scarcely knows."
So?
What?
We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.
"You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?"
"Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave."
"Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin!  This way. Prepare thyself."
"And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se!  With this thy transformation is done."
"It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires."
"Oh, oh no, are we in trouble?"
"Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se."
"(Please, what do you want?! Let me go!)"
"(No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)"
(I'm not really a vampire.)
"Okay, let's all be seated please?  This is thee noon meeting of the Vamp kids? I am Mike, your lord and dark master, per se."
