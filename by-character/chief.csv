"Ah, Stephen and Linda's child. Last time I saw you, you were the size of a coconut. Who's the haole?"
"In the time-honored traditions of our ancestors, we honor the native Hawaiian Butters Stotch with his hapa noa.  The shark-tooth necklace represents your connection to our island.  Now drink the chi-chi!"

"Right this way, Bill. Welcome to the NSA main office."
"There's a lot of people working here at the NSA. Good people, people who just wanna keep America safe. Only problem is, checking all those e-mails, Twitter accounts, and surveilling all those phone calls can take a lot of manpower.Â "
