And the last time you saw your penis was two days ago?
What is it?
"Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone. Afraid there's nothing more we can do. You'll just have to live with being a woman. A very ugly one. Come on, men."
"Alright, things are pretty quiet out there, boys. Let's try to get caught up on some paperwork. Murphy I want you to-"
"Oh, not this kid again."
What?
"Jesus Christ,  can we get a lock on that window?  Look kid, you need to stop-"
"Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents!"
Whatever. Then we'll just put you in-
Just get out of here before we-!
"All right, stop it!"
What's in here?
"Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have?"
You are a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak and dreary world!
You think your bullets can hurt him?
"Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante"
Well I'm sorry but you're under arrest. Take the kid to jail.
"Dammit Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly son in line!"
"Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like."
Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?
"Alright, we'll put a sheet over him."
Obviously the terrorists are for real!  What does that paper say?  We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah.
You won't believe it...
"Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible!"
"Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to definitely get bombed."
"Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep."
Mr. Mackey? Mr. Mackey!  We're putting a stop to this play! It's over.
"No. it's over! They got him, Mr. Mackey. Tooth Decay. They got the sonofabitch."
"You can let it go, Mackey. Tooth Decay is gone."
"Sir, does this mailman belong to you?"
"There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it."
"We'll send a bill for the damages,  but in the meantime, please keep a closer eye on your child, sir?"
"Well, at least everything is accounted for. Thank God you came when you did, Dr. Janus."
"Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son."
This is South Park Police!
"We know the truth, Dr. Janus!"
He's not Chinese! He's white!
Your name is Dr. Janus!
"That's right. Of all his multiple personalities, the strongest was Lu Kim. And we never would have known... if it hadn'ta been for Inspector Butters."
"Yes, I'm sure he could. But, then again,  does the world really need another therapist?"
"Well I mean, would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking he's Lu Kim forever? Now that City Sushi is gone, City Wok is the only Chinese restaurant left in town."
Done!
Go ahead. We're gonna process him and get him back to the restaurant.
"You'd better give me every cop you've got on the South Side! I don't care where ABC parks their truck, as long as it doesn't block the fire trucks!  Jesus, this protest is getting out of hand! Alright, what exactly are we dealing with?"
And where are the actual protesters?
How are we gonna contain this ting?!
Bon Jovi?
Damnit! Don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards?  Full-on class warfare.
It's here! The class warfare is finally here!
"All right, quiet down people, please! Quiet!  I know you're all worried about your families' security. All I can tell you is that so far, Bane has not been caught."
Now listen! There's nothing more we can do to protect your homes. But there's someone here who says he can.
So you say this man killed himself because he was a psychopath who was forced to have sex with his mother?
Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes.
Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed?
"What?! Are you crazy?! We can't cancel the Monster Mash, it's Halloween Night! It's the Monster Mash's biggest night of the year!"
How many people at the Monster Mash?
You boys say you can identify the Red Box thieves?
All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise.
FIRE!
We got the sonofabitch!
"Well, I hope you guys have learned that crime doesn't pay."
"Nono, none of us watched the video, but if we did, we could handle it. We're police officers. We see sickening things like that every day."
"All right, all right. We'll do everything we can."
