"I can't wait till the day I kiss you.
Until then I have to tease you.
'Cause my mom doesn't like it when I'm naughty.
She'll make me clean my room if I'm naughty."
You'd take your love and go.
To put my arm around you?
"Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take my time.
Can't wait 'til you are mine, but it might be a while. 'Cause,
yeah yeah, girl, we can take it slow, so we have room to grow.
And then someday we can get it on.
Until then, go back to Montreal."
"Hey, there, girls!"
"I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
Can't just do whatever I feel like, I've got to stay right, just and true.
I can't hang out with my buddies and get into trouble, 
'Cause now we're both wearing these rings for each other.
But who needs sex and drugs and partying 
When we can cook a meal, then sit around and watch Netflix...
Bay-bay!
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me that I must behave.
No need to chase after girls; it's a promise I can never break.
I made a commitment and it is forever, 
So we can spend every waking minute together.
And if we get bored it won't be a problem, 
'Cause we can just hang out with other couples who wear these rings...
Bay-bay!"
"I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
What I cannot do.
Bay... bay...
Baaay...
Baybay.
Baybay.
Baaaybaaaaay."
