"Hear me, demons! Lord Satan has demanded a Ferrari cake! Now I will take charge of Halloween, and call upon the spirits of Hell's most evil souls! Ted Bundy!  Jeffrey Dahmer!  And John Wayne Gacy!  You shall rise once again to walk the earth, for tomorrow is Halloween, and I need you... to pick up Satan's Ferrari cake, and deliver it to the W Hotel!"
"Heed my words: Satan's entire Halloween depends on this Ferrari cake. Fail, and you will know his greatest wrath!"
