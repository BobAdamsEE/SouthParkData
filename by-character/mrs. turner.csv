"The new girl in your class, Marjorine."
"I know, sweetie, but I got a call from Marjorine's mother."
"She said Marjorine is having a really hard time being in a new school. Her mom asked me personally if we could have Marjorine over, and besides, her mother told me that she works as a state official and that I should  respect her authoratay."
"Marjorine, sweetie your mom's on the phone."
