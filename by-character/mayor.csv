"Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!"
"Thank you so much for coming, Muhammad."
"Muhammad, would that be OK?"
You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad.
What?!
"Jesus, what are we supposed to do?!"
Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.
"Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator."
"That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?"
Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
"Children, as you all know, Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay."
"Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park."
"Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play."
"Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best.  And who's our little prize winner again?"
"How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?"
"Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!"
"Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?"
"Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it."
"Oh, don't they look adorable?"
Oh my God!
"Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford."
"Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?"
"Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play."
Where is she?
Here she comes.
It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
What?
What? Oh God!
"Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song."
Thank you Chef!
"And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kaufman..."
"...is your favorite celebrity, and mine  Kathie Lee Gifford!"
"Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!"
"We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, butâ€¦"
My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
"Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!"
Just send in the geometrist.
"You are fired, buddy!"
What does this mean to the town?
My God!
"Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there?"
"Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh.  Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control."
"All we know right now is that some of our children  are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?"
"You can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1  All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids."
"Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!"
"Huh, what?"
"And, that would be good? Alright?"
"Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!"
"God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-"
What... is that thing?
Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?
"Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt."
"Oh, how sweet."
Turn off the cameras!
I just had a brown baby boy.
"Ugh!  Why, why Chef. What a surprise!"
"Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia."
"You mean, Tina Yothers?"
"Well, let's get back to it."
"I noticed! Call the National Guard!  Ohohohoh, we'll get you, you bitch.  And to think I actually watched your HBO special."
Hmmm.
"Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?"
The press is here.
Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.
Really??
"Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?"
Shh.
Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
"Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay!"
Yes. We're trapped!
"My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen."
"Buut, how do we decide ""who""?"
We're all going to die in this horrible place.
"Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts."
"Well, there's no going back now.  We're cannibals.  God save us."
"My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive."
But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
"I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful."
He is.
No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.
"Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh--"
"Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady!"
"Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?!"
"Well, how's the reading coming along?"
"Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night."
The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene.
"You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!"
"Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals;  where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.  But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!  And now, let's kick off our weeklong festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!  Let's hear it for these brave souls!  What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators!"
Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.
"Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China.  Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats!"
"And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!"
"Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now--"
Here she comes!
It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
"Wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day.  Let's have ice cream, everyone!"
"This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake.  I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call.  Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems!  Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smartass, I was being ironic..!"
"Well, keep looking."
This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
"Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa--  Oooooogh..."
Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
Ooooh!
Comanche helicopters...
"...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time..."
"Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!"
Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
"Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!"
Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
Shut up!
"Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.  Wait a minute... It's the snake!"
"Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!"
What is fuck is that?!
"Oh, hell. Light the snake!"
"My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.  Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?"
"Yes, you know, expire, end.  Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?"
What?!
"Oh my God!  You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!"
So when does it run out?!
"Oh, hell..!"
"Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly."
"Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city."
They're Hollywood! They can do anything!
"Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?"
"Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town."
"Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?"
"Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!"
"Ohh, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show."
"Oh, come on, buck up, little fella."
"Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp.  Aw, hell..!"
You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?
"Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet?"
"Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are."
"Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country."
"Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do."
"So I guess you wanna do some campaigning.  You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up..."
"...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you."
"All right, what's next."
"Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like..."
"Like Toto. And then the Harbuck's guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes."
"Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say ""yippee."""
"All those opposed, say ""nay."""
"Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment."
What the hell is going on here?
Reward? What reward?
"Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off."
Holy crap! He's alive??
"Well, quick, do something!"
"Well, you just can't let him die."
"Ooh, yes. How are you?"
Right over here.
What?
"Oh, neato."
"Hope. Why, that's a perfectly beautiful name!"
"No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!"
"Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!"
Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.
"And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!"
We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone.
She's a cannon!
"Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out!"
"All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave."
"But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?"
"Yes, Memphis.  You jakovasaurs would love it there."
But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right?
Now what do we do?
You have?
You can't leave.
"Come onn, come on!  Hello!"
"Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?!"
"Of course! That's the point! Just be ready this afternoon at the public access building, and good luck! Hope you win!!"
"We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some normalcy back to this town! Ready?"
"Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose!"
"Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs!  Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France!  And, all one of you lucky constetants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players?"
Okay. Hands on your buzzers.
You have to wait until I ask the question first.
That's okay. Hands on buzzers.
Will somebody please unplug the God-damned buzzers?!
"Now, can we get on with this? First question: What color is blue?"
What?
"What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on.  You're supposed to lose, you idiot!"
"Just don't answer any more questions, got it?"
"Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!"
"What's two plus two, Jakov?"
"Jakov, what is your name?"
"Oh, screw it. Jakov wins!"
You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!
"All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport!  Let's go, people! There's no time to lose!"
"I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution."
"Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!"
"People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying..."
"Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen?"
"O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution."
Children are fickle.  All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.
"Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip"
"Look out, he's got a gun!"
"Oh.  Oh, I think he's tryin' to tell us that he wants to relocate all his species here to Australia."
"Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take all your people in."
Guess the little pecker doesn't like missionaries.
"All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals!  This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary."
"And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds!"
"Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school.  All right, Mark. Your word is ""conscientious."""
Closely attentive to details. Careful.
Mary's analysis of the spreadsheet was... conscientious.
"Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman.  Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr."
"Eric, your word is ""chair."""
Something you sit on.
English!
"Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is ""chair""!!"
"All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school.  Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral."
Having to do with a lake or ocean.
Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.
Correct!
Now we have Kyle Broflovski.  Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.
Krocsyldiphithic.
Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality.
"Certainly. ""Krocsyldiphithic"" is a hard word to spell."
"Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca.  You are truly South Park's finest."
"Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?"
"Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!"
"Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.  and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it."
"Oh, boy."
"Oh brother, what now?!"
"Ooh, Jesus. What a mess."
"Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case.  We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen?  There. Is that better?"
"No, but look! He's got a little smile now!  See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think?  Well, some people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?"
"Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!"
What?
"This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week.  Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag!"
"Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!"
Meugh. Send them in.
You do?
"An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!"
"But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars."
"This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year."
"It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming."
"Oh. Mr. Hankey, it's you. How wonderful."
"Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children."
"We know that after you see this darling short film,  you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?"
"Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties."
"Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!"
Fine. Then we'll sue you.  Johnson?
"They're starting to understand, Johnson."
"Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop."
"Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?"
