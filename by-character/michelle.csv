"Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing?"
"Okay Barack, tell me what's going on?"
"What is it?  Barack, what is it?!"
You gotta be kiddin' me. So the entire diamond vault is inaccessible?! Is McCain online?
You guys weren't runnin' update checks on the security logs?!
"On a new system, in an hour?! Are you nuts? My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three scan hacks into a laser system!"
Egh. Tell Davis to get me a fortrans emitter and enough pulse drives to light a spark.
I've almost got it. You're only going to have five minutes. Do you understand?
"Oh Jesus, now is not the time, B."
"My girls need somebody better than a world-class diamond thief. Woowait, there! I got it."
Go!
You're serious.
"Aww, what the fuck."
"Well, as I was saying, I tried and tried, but my overturned car just won't budge. My husband was trapped for twelve hours."
"That's right. He's a very brave man, and I love him very much."
"Oho good, you're going to be so happy."
"Great, so do you have the two hundred and forty dollars.  Perfect! We're on our way!  Come on over here and I'll fill you in on how the Church of Scientology works.  You see, Stan, Scientology was founded by a great man named L. Ron Hubbard.  Mr. Hubbard discovered that negative emotions are actually caused by things called ""body thetans."""
"Yes! And being the genius that he was, Mr. Hubbard invented a way to get rid of those bad thetans.  This is called an E-meter. It's the main tool of Scientology. You just grab a hold of these handles as I talk you through past experiences in your life. I'll be taking readings here, and we'll be able to determine your thetan levels."
"Come on in the auditing room and I'll show you how it works.  All these people are just like you, Stan, auditing with E-meters to get rid of their negative emotions.  All right, Stan, I want you to just relax and take hold of the E-meter handles."
"Just take a few deep breaths, and I'll just get a base reading of your thetan levels.  Huh, that's, that's strange."
"Somethin-,  something's wrong. Brian, could you come over here a second?"
Will you... look at his thetan levels?
