5,1,Kyle,"Hey you guys! Look what I have!
"
5,1,Stan,"What?
"
5,1,Kyle,"Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
"
5,1,Stan and Kenny,"...Oh.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
"
5,1,Stan,"Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
"
5,1,Cartman,"You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!
"
5,1,Kyle,"What, doughboy?
"
5,1,Cartman,"I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
"
5,1,Stan,"So?
"
5,1,Cartman,"So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.
"
5,1,Kyle,"What?
"
5,1,Cartman,"No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
"
5,1,Kyle,"What?!
"
5,1,Cartman,"You'll never guess.
"
5,1,Stan,"What?!
"
5,1,Cartman,"Guess.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
"
5,1,Cartman,"You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say,  ""Shit.""
"
5,1,Kyle,"They're gonna say ""shit"" on television?
"
5,1,Stan,"They can't say ""shit"" on television!
"
5,1,Cartman,"It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.
"
5,1,Stan,"Holy fucking shit!
"
5,1,Kenny,"(Dude! We've gotta watch!)
"
5,1,Cartman,"Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said ""shit"" on television!
"
5,1,Kyle,"It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
"
5,1,Stan,"Aw, come, on dude! This is history.
"
5,1,Kyle,"It's stupid!
"
5,1,Cartman,"Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
"
5,1,Kyle,"No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
"
5,1,Randy,"Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?
"
5,1,Sam,"Yeah, they're gonna say ""shit"" on television.
"
5,1,Colleague 1,"Hey, we should all get together and watch it at the bar.
"
5,1,Colleague 2,"Yeaaahhh!
"
5,1,Sam,"Yeah.
"
5,1,Randy,"Yeah.
"
5,1,Colleague 2,"Are you guys gonna let your kids watch?
"
5,1,Randy,"Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.
"
5,1,Sam,"And they're gonna say ""shit""!
"
5,1,Kyle,"Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
"
5,1,Butters,"Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say ""shit"" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.
"
5,1,Kyle,"How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes! 
"
5,1,Cop,"Listen, Mitchell, I put my life on the line every day. How dare you accuse me!
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes.
"
5,1,Mitchell,"I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped!
"
5,1,Jimbo,"Oh, was that it? Was that it?!
"
5,1,Randy,"Shipped. He said ""shipped"".
"
5,1,Frank,"I told you, we don't have a record of that. And besides, -
"
5,1,Cartman,"Goddamn it! When are they gonna say ""shit""?!
"
5,1,Stan,"Sh!
"
5,1,Mitchell,"Maybe... maybe protect them from you?
"
5,1,Frank,"Maybe you're forgetting who you're talking to!
"
5,1,Mitchell,"And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too!
"
5,1,Frank,"Yeah? You used to be a lot of things.
"
5,1,Sheila,"Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?
"
5,1,Mitchell,"That's it, I've had enough of this.
"
5,1,Frank,"Don't you turn your back on me, you!
"
5,1,Mitchell,"I said, enough!
"
5,1,Frank,"Is it?
"
5,1,Frank,"Will it... ever be enough?
"
5,1,Announcer,"Cop Drama will return after these messages.
"
5,1,Stan,"Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say ""shit?""
"
5,1,Cartman,"I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
"
5,1,Stan and Kyle,"Uh! 
"
5,1,Stan,"Where are you going, Kyle?
"
5,1,Kyle,"I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
"
5,1,Stan,"But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say ""shit"" and you're gonna miss it!
"
5,1,Kyle,"I don't really give a fuck! 
"
5,1,Stan,"Oh.
"
5,1,Mitchell,"Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop.
"
5,1,Frank,"Well, Mitchell. I guess you're goin'ta do what you're gonna do. Let's just try and stay friends no matter what.
"
5,1,Mitchell,"You're right. Maybe I'll see you around.
"
5,1,Frank,"Goodbye. Oh, and Mitchell?  You've got some shit on the side of your mouth right there.
"
5,1,Mitchell,"Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks.
"
5,1,Bar Patrons,"Wow!!!
"
5,1,The Boys,"Whoa!!!
"
5,1,Chef and Principle Victoria,"Oh!!
"
5,1,Old Folks,"Whoa!
"
5,1,Jimbo,"They did it!
"
5,1,Stan,"I can't believe they actually said it. 
"
5,1,Cartman,"Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!
"
5,1,Kyle,"Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
"
5,1,Cartman,"Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
"
5,1,Kyle,"Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?
"
5,1,Cartman,"Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Oh, whatever. 
"
5,1,Anchor Tom,"Last night, the daring and bold show, Cop Drama , broke new ground by saying ""Shit!"" on television, making ""shit"" officially okay to say around the country.  A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far, while a whopping 76% say they don't really give a shit.  In other news, a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community.  Rick Watts has the story.
"
5,1,Rick Watts,"Thanks, Tom. Shit is certainly going down here in the small town- 
"
5,1,Tom,"Whoa, shit!
"
5,1,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, ""shit"".
"
5,1,Stan,"Wow! We can say ""shit"" in school now?!
"
5,1,Kyle,"This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
"
5,1,Ms. Choksondik,"Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form
"
5,1,Cartman,"Huh?
"
5,1,Ms. Choksondik,"You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance,  ""That's a shitty picture of me."" is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of  ""This is a picture of shit."" is still naughty. 
"
5,1,Cartman,"I don't get it.
"
5,1,Stan,"Me neither.
"
5,1,Ms. Choksondik,"The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example:  ""The weather outside is shitty."" However, the literal adjective is not appropriate. For example:  ""My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty.""  That's right out!
"
5,1,Timmy,"Sss...sss... shit. 
"
5,1,Ms. Choksondik,"Very good, Timmy.
"
5,1,Butters,"Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, ""Oh, shit,"" or, ""shit on a shingle""?
"
5,1,Ms. Choksondik,"Yes, that's now fine.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
"
5,1,Kyle,"It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
"
5,1,Cartman,"Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
"
5,1,Kyle,"There's no sand in my vagina!!!
"
5,1,Ms. Choksondik,"Boys, watch your language! Shit!
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"And so, children, instead of saying ""Hand in your papers,"" I may now say, ""Hand in your shit."" Any questions?
"
5,1,Filmore,"What about, ""I have to take a shit""?
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"No! No, Filmore! You can say ""I have to poop and shit,"" or ""Oh, shit, I have to poop,"" but not ""I have to shit."" Are we all clear?
"
5,1,Kindergartners,"No.
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Look, it's all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I'm gay. That means that now I can say the word, ""fag"". On television they usually don't allow ""fag"". But because I'm gay, it's alright. And with the new approval of the word, ""shit,"" that means that finally I am free to say,Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do? Oh this is great!
"
5,1,Elderly Woman,"Why that store has such lovely shit.
"
5,1,Elderly Man,"Yeah.  Too bad I don't have shit for cash right now. 
"
5,1,Principal Victoria,"Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty.
"
5,1,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've done enough shit outside today and shit.
"
5,1,Man,"Shit, Peter, you look like shit.
"
5,1,Peter,"No, shit, I feel like shit. I think I-
"
5,1,Woman 1,"Holy shit!
"
5,1,Woman 2,"Did you see that shit? 
"
5,1,Barbardy,"What kind of shit is this?
"
5,1,Man 1,"That is some weird shit. 
"
5,1,Woman 3,"Susan, your shit's ready!
"
5,1,Man 2,"Do you know where this shit goes? 
"
5,1,Man 3,"Shit if I know.
"
5,1,Woman 4,"Nice going, shit-for-brains.
"
5,1,Man 4,"''Old McDonald took a shit, E I E I O
"
5,1,Man 5,"No shit!
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"''Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there,-
"
5,1,Man 6,"Oh, shit, 'scuse me. 
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, watch it, fag.
"
5,1,Man 6,"What did you call me?
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"I called you a fag. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word ""fag"". So piss off, you fag-shitter! Heh, so hey there, shity shitty fag fagShitty shitty fag fag, ba doop a doop doo 
"
5,1,Stan,"This sucks. Now that ""shit""'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of ""shit"". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. 
"
5,1,Stan,"What's meecrob?
"
5,1,Cartman,"You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than ""shit"", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. 
"
5,1,Kyle,"You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
"
5,1,Stan,"What?
"
5,1,Kyle,"Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.
"
5,1,Kyle,"I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".
"
5,1,Stan,"What's that?
"
5,1,Cartman,"Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! 
"
5,1,HBC President,"...Seventy-five share. My God, I never thought it was possible.
"
5,1,Director 1,"Sir, your ""shit"" idea has turned the entire network around. We're proud to work for you. 
"
5,1,Director 2,"Sir, I'd just like to take this opportunity: And, I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say, you are the most creative genius in Hollywood, and... well... I'd let you have me if you wanted.
"
5,1,HBC President,"Thanks, Roger, but I've only just started. You see, I've already figured out our new marketing scheme technique for the next run of shows.
"
5,1,Director 3,"Whoa!
"
5,1,Director 4,"He's unstoppable!
"
5,1,Director 1,"What's the new idea?
"
5,1,Director 3,"I can hardly wait.
"
5,1,Director 5,"I'm about to piss myself!
"
5,1,HBC President,"This Saturday... on HBC... we're going to say...  ""shit"" ...twice.
"
5,1,Director 3,"Twice!
"
5,1,Director 4,"Brilliant!
"
5,1,Director 6,"Think of the repetition!
"
5,1,Director 3,"It's like saying it once... but double!
"
5,1,HBC President,"Well gentlemen, let's get on it!
"
5,1,All,"Ho! 
"
5,1,Chef,"Baby you are so fine, and shit!The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day! Oh, hello there, children.
"
5,1,The Boys,"Hey Chef.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from?
"
5,1,Chef,"Uh, from your ass, children.
"
5,1,Kyle,"No no! The word, ""shit"".
"
5,1,Chef,"Oh.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Detective Sandy Vagina here  thinks that ""shit"" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".
"
5,1,Chef,"The Black Death? Are you sure?
"
5,1,Stan,"What's the Black Death, Chef?
"
5,1,Chef,"LaToya Jackson, children.
"
5,1,The Boys,"Oh.
"
5,1,Chef,"But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!
"
5,1,Chef,"It says here the word, ""shit"" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, ""skite"".
"
5,1,Kyle,"Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague.
"
5,1,Librarian,"This is the oldest book in the library.  A priceless original of England's history. Just about everything you could want to know about the plague is in this great tome.  Oh, shit. Well, this other book has some good information, too. 
"
5,1,Chef,"The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.
"
5,1,Stan,"Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. 
"
5,1,Chef,"Look at this, children.  It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse.
"
5,1,Stan,"Word of curse?
"
5,1,Kyle,"A... curse word.
"
5,1,Chef,"Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term ""curse word"" before.
"
5,1,Stan,"Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
"
5,1,Cartman,"You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Cartman, this is serious!!!
"
5,1,Cartman,"So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. 
"
5,1,Librarian,"If you don't mind, I'll have to close up now. They're going to say ""shit"" seven times on HBC and I- 
"
5,1,Stan,"Holy shit!
"
5,1,Cartman,"Oh-Ho, gross!
"
5,1,Kyle,"Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! 
"
5,1,Stan,"Uh oh.
"
5,1,Kenny,"(Uh oh.)
"
5,1,Cartman,"Kenny's got it. heh heh.
"
5,1,Kyle,"We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network,  ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word!
"
5,1,Chef,"Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and ""shit"", could be linked!
"
5,1,Captain,"Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit.  And over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too.  Well, we should be arriving in Los Angeles in about two hours. Until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service. 
"
5,1,Cartman,"Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!
"
5,1,Kyle,"Cartman, stop being an asshole! 
"
5,1,Director 5,"Tha ratings are in, sir. We broke another record last night with the show that said ""shit"" seven times! 
"
5,1,Director 1,"Where is the roof on this thing? I mean, I mean, how can we top ourselves now? 
"
5,1,HBC President,"Gentlemen, I have it. The end-all greatest marketing ploy of all time.  Tonight, on HBC, we will air all our sitcoms... LIVE. And have everyone say ""shit"" in place of their written lines. And we'll call it ""Must Shit TV"".
"
5,1,Director 1,"Bravo!
"
5,1,Director 2,"""Night Of A Million Shits!""
"
5,1,HBC President,"Now, doing this live will be difficult, so we must- 
"
5,1,Chef,"Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer!
"
5,1,HBC President,"Who are you?
"
5,1,Chef,"My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about ""shit"".
"
5,1,HBC President,"Oh brother, another Christian protest group.
"
5,1,Director 1,"Who wants to take this one?
"
5,1,Director 2,"I'll get it.  Gentlemen, we appreciate your concern.  Here at HBC the general goal is providing the highest and most thought-provoking netertainment. How great it is that we live in a country where an artist can express himself freely. That's not only the American spirit, it's the HBC spirit. Which allows us to make great family programs like Halo The Turtle, and of course, everyone's favorite show, Cop Drama. We can't thank you enough for bringing your concerns to our network, for it is you, the loyal HBC viewer, who makes this great network, and indeed, the great country that it is. 
"
5,1,HBC President,"Alright, now, as I was saying-
"
5,1,Chef,"Hey! Hold on a minute!
"
5,1,HBC President,"Aw, are they stil here?
"
5,1,Chef,"Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?
"
5,1,Kyle,"We think that you might have could it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word. 
"
5,1,Director 4,"Hm, right, right.
"
5,1,Kyle,"It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
"
5,1,HBC President,"Do you have any proof of this?
"
5,1,Kyle,"...No.
"
5,1,HBC President,"Then  get out of here before we have you thrown out!
"
5,1,Cartman,"But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?
"
5,1,Chef,"Damn cracker-ass producers!
"
5,1,Stan,"Now what are we gonna do, Chef?
"
5,1,Chef,"I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way.
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"Aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.
"
5,1,Stan,"Oh shit!
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"Stand aside! 
"
5,1,HBC President,"Alright, now, we have to get all our biggest names to say ""shit"", and then we're gonna- 
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"Halt your evil plans!
"
5,1,Executives,"Huh?
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"I possess the Rune Stone of Undoing! Who is in charge here? 
"
5,1,HBC President,"Oh...  No, you guys didn't hire me a stripper for my birthday- oh, tell me you guys didn't.
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"Show your true form, Geldon, lest you be afraid! Your short time in this world is at an end!  Ach. The Rune Stone has no effect! You are not Geldon!
"
5,1,HBC President,"I never said I was.
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"You will die anyway, for you have spread the word of curse! 
"
5,1,HBC President,"Security! 
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"Ach!  oh.
"
5,1,Chef,"Who are you?
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"Take this. 
"
5,1,Stan,"What are we supposed to do with it?
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"Eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. 
"
5,1,Kyle,"Now what?
"
5,1,Chef,"We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!
"
5,1,Announcer,"Lords and Ladies, we bid you welcome to the grandest casino in the land, Excalibur! 
"
5,1,Barker,"Take a free spin. Double your odds. 
"
5,1,Chef,"'Scuse me. Do you work here?
"
5,1,Barker,"How can I help you, noble sir?
"
5,1,Kyle,"We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
"
5,1,Barker,"A what?
"
5,1,Stan,"It might hold the key to a curse.
"
5,1,Barker,"Uh... I can help get you some credit or a comp meal, perhaps.
"
5,1,Stan,"Dude, we need help from the British!
"
5,1,Barker,"Look kid, This is just a casino. I can't help you. You know, not every British person knows about wizards  and dragons and curses.
"
5,1,Chef,"We just need help identifying this. 
"
5,1,Barker,"The Rune Stome of Gaelic! Where did you get this?
"
5,1,Stan,"You know what it is?
"
5,1,Barker,"The Skire once spoke of such a stone! Come, we must see the sorcerer! 
"
5,1,Announcer,"Get ready for ""Must Shit TV""! Starting now, four straight hours of pure shit! It's all live!
"
5,1,Drew,"Hey! Heh, shit! Heh.  Ya ain't shit.
"
5,1,Mimi,"Yeah. Dude, ya ain't shit! 
"
5,1,HBC President,"This is it. My greatest work.
"
5,1,Waitress,"Cocktails. Cocktails.
"
5,1,Barker,"These Americans wish to see the Skire!
"
5,1,Waitress,"Let us make haste to the inner sanctum!
"
5,1,Barker,"How could you foolish Americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting the word of wretchedness?!
"
5,1,Chef,"Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to.
"
5,1,Barker,"Didn't you realize ""shit"" is a curse word?!
"
5,1,Stan,"Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew ""curse word"" meant... curse word.
"
5,1,Barker,"Ha! Leave it to Americans to think that ""no"" means yes, ""pissed"" means angry, and ""curse word"" means something other than a word that's cursed!!
"
5,1,Sorcerer,"Let me see the stone. 
"
5,1,Chef,"But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.
"
5,1,Barker,"Saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing. It's only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place.
"
5,1,Sorcerer,"I've seen this before. Stones that were used by the Knights of Standards and Practices.
"
5,1,Chef,"Knights of Standards and Practices?
"
5,1,Sorcerer,"A legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay. But... they were just a myth.
"
5,1,Mimi,"You know what? You're dumb as shit!
"
5,1,Drew,"Oh yeah?! Well, I don't really give a shit!
"
5,1,Randy,"Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.
"
5,1,Man 7,"Yeah, they're gonna have to come up with a new swear word soon.
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Well, they can't use ""fag"". Because you can't say ""fag"" unless you're a homosexual.
"
5,1,Randy,"Really? So we can't say ***?
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"No. See, you got beeped.
"
5,1,Man 7,"You mean you have to be a *** to say ***?
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"That's right.
"
5,1,Jimbo,"Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say ""fag"". 
"
5,1,Randy,"...Hey, you didn't get beeped.
"
5,1,Jimbo,"Uh oh.
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you freakin' fag! You wanna make out or something?
"
5,1,Drew,"Oh, man, I am up shit creek.
"
5,1,Mimi,"Serves you right, shit-for-brains!
"
5,1,Drew,"Yeah, how could I be such a dumb sh-
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"Say not the word of curse! 
"
5,1,HBC President,"What the?
"
5,1,Mimi,"Holy shit! 
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now!
"
5,1,Sorcerer,"The knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum. Should a curse word ever be let out, they would return. A rune for each word of curse was made, representing each of the eight words that so offended God...
"
5,1,Stan,"Look, there's the F-word.
"
5,1,Kyle,"And asshole.
"
5,1,Cartman,"I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
"
5,1,Sorcerer,"Look at this: The writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil Geldon , who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power. Then all the world will be destroyed.
"
5,1,Stan,"All the world destroyed?
"
5,1,Cartman,"My house, too?
"
5,1,Chef,"Oh no!
"
5,1,Sorcerer,"What?
"
5,1,Chef,"Tonight is the ""Night of a Million Shits"" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over!
"
5,1,Sorcerer,"Then we haven't much time. We must go!
"
5,1,Blond Knight,"Turn off those devices of broadcast!
"
5,1,HBC President,"What is going on here?! Stop this shit!
"
5,1,Blond Knight,"We are the Royal Order of Standards and Practices! 
"
5,1,Bald Knight,"We command you to stop saying the curse word!
"
5,1,HBC President,"Listen, Mr. Shinypants, I am the head of this network, and I will say ""shit"" all I want! Shit, shit, shit shit shit, shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit, , shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit! Oh, shit!
"
5,1,Announcer,"And now, back to Must Shit TV, here on HBC.
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"He is too strong! We cannot fight him without the rune stone!
"
5,1,Director 1,"My, my GOD, sir! What have you unleashed upon the world?!
"
5,1,HBC President,"I didn't know.  I didn't know!!!
"
5,1,Randy,"I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Wait! 
"
5,1,Cartman,"Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! 
"
5,1,Lead Knight,"The rune stone! Point it towards Geldon! 
"
5,1,Geldon,"Agh. Dude, lame. Lame!  Bummer, dudes. 
"
5,1,Cartman,"What a stupid voice.
"
5,1,Kyle,"It's okay. The curse has been lifted. 
"
5,1,Stan,"Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
"
5,1,Kyle,"You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.
"
5,1,Kyle,"We're all saying the S-word too much! 
"
5,1,Ike,"Kyle.
"
5,1,Sheila,"Look, Gerald. Kyle's on television! 
"
5,1,Gerald,"Uh huh.
"
5,1,Kyle,"The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
"
5,1,Stan,"And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.
"
5,1,Cartman,"So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. 
"
5,1,The men,"Yeah.
"
5,1,Randy,"That makes sense.
"
5,1,Colleague 1,"Ain't that right?
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Is this still part of the show?
"
5,1,HBC President,"We're sorry, noble knights of Standards and Practices.  From now on, we will obey your laws.
"
5,1,Blond Knight,"See that you do!
"
5,1,Chef,"I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.
"
5,1,Stan,"Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!
"
5,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, I didn't- 
"
5,1,Stan,"Holy shi-  poop.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Hah, I love you guys.
"
5,2,Randy,"Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.
"
5,2,Stan,"It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.
"
5,2,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
5,2,Stuart,"Well, now, that's part of the fun.
"
5,2,Randy,"Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
"
5,2,Stan,"Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. 
"
5,2,Cartman,"That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
"
5,2,Stan,"Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??
"
5,2,Timmy,"Hyeah Timmay!
"
5,2,Cartman,"Yeah, he's excited.
"
5,2,Butters,"Hey, fellas!
"
5,2,Cartman,"Hey, Butters.
"
5,2,Butters,"Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
"
5,2,Randy,"Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.
"
5,2,Stuart,"You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Hello scouts!
"
5,2,Stan,"Hey, it's Big Gay Al!
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
5,2,Randy,"You're the new scout leader?
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"I just got transferred in.  I think everyone's here now, so we can get started.  Come on, Scouts. We've got work to do! 
"
5,2,Boys,"Hooray! 
"
5,2,Stan,"See ya, Dad!
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses.  Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy! 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Well hello everyone. 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Ji- Jimmay?
"
5,2,Stuart,"Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!
"
5,2,Randy,"He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
"
5,2,Stephen,"Well how gay is he?
"
5,2,Stuart,"He's really, really gay.
"
5,2,Token's father,"Well then, I don't want my boy there, either. 
"
5,2,Randy,"So he's a homosexual. So what?
"
5,2,Stuart,"I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??
"
5,2,Skeeter,"You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls. 
"
5,2,Randy,"Aw, that's ridiculous.
"
5,2,Priest Maxi,"People, people, please! You're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice! As many of you know, I, myself, went through a... homosexual... phase. But the light of Christ showed me how to change. Just give me two hours with this man, and I can convert him back.
"
5,2,Man,"That's what you said about Peterson, and then you ended up having sex with him!
"
5,2,Man 2,"That's right.
"
5,2,Man 3,"You did.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: Motivational standup comedy.  Let's give him a big hand. 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Wow, what a great audience.  Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B.  You guys like im- personations? 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmy.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"How about Jimmy Stewart? ""Merry Christmas, movie house."" And John Travolta. ""Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!""
"
5,2,Stan,"Jimmy's funny, dude.
"
5,2,Butters,"Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Hmph! 
"
5,2,Stuart,"Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock.
"
5,2,Randy,"Come on, Stanley.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Oops, guess we're out of time, kids. Now remember, tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money. We'll meet back here next Tuesday, and see who raised the most. Good luck.
"
5,2,Stan,"Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?
"
5,2,Cartman,"Hey, yeah!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmuh Timmy Timmy Timmy. 
"
5,2,Stan,"Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas.
"
5,2,Randy,"Come on, Stan.
"
5,2,Stan,"Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.
"
5,2,Kenny,"(Yeah, see ya.)
"
5,2,"Stan, Cartman","Bye, Jimmy.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas.
"
5,2,Stan,"You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!
"
5,2,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
5,2,Stan,"We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
"
5,2,Cartman,"Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.
"
5,2,Stan,"And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Yahahah!!!
"
5,2,Cartman,"Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
"
5,2,Stan,"Cartman, don't say ""use him"", you big silly goose. 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Ah.
"
5,2,Randy,"What did you say?!
"
5,2,Stan,"I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.
"
5,2,Stuart,"Uh huh!
"
5,2,Randy,"You do not say ""Big silly goose""! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!
"
5,2,Stan,"Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-
"
5,2,Randy,"Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!
"
5,2,Stan,"...Asshole. 
"
5,2,Randy,"That's better.
"
5,2,Cartman,"Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch.
"
5,2,Stan,"Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired!  What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, ""Are you angry at God for making disabled people?"" I say, ""No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush."" 
"
5,2,Sharon,"What a brave little boy.
"
5,2,Sheila,"He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him! 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park.  H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? ""Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!"" 
"
5,2,Cartman,"Hehe, I don't sound like that.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"And how about that school counselor? ""Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad.""  ""Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?""  Wow, what a great audience. ""Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-""  ""Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat""  ""I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch.""  ""Salisbury steak for lunch."" Eh. Uh. ""Goddamnit, Goddamnit!""  And of course, my very favorite, ""Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!""  ""Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy."" Heh. Sometimes it's like, ""Please, Timmy, learn a new word,"" heh. ""Timmy! Tu-Timmy!"" 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Aaaaaaah! 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake. 
"
5,2,Man,"Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my
"
5,2,Timmy,"Tiiimm-mmah!!!!!
"
5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Well, this is it. We've simply gotten too many complaints from concerned parents about him. I'm afraid we don't have a choice.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Hi ya fellas! 
"
5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"How are you today, Scout?
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event. Yippie!
"
5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Uh, Big Gay Al, it's recently come to our attention that you are... gay.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Well, stop the presses. Did you figure that out all by yourselves, silly buns?
"
5,2,Scoutmaster 1,"Yes, well, unfortunately for you, the Scouts have a policy that openly gay men cannot belong.
"
5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"We are left with no options, Mr. Al. I'm afraid you are hereby... out of Scouts.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Out of... Scouts?
"
5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"We're sorry, Mr. Gay Al.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"But I've been in Scouts since I was nine - it's a... huge part of my life.
"
5,2,Scoutmaster 2,"Uh, you must understand that Scouts is a private club. A club that follows certain beliefs, and one of those beliefs is that homosexuality is immoral.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"I see...
"
5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"It's nothing against you personally
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"What if I promise not to be gay anymore?  Pinky swear.
"
5,2,Scoutmaster 2,"We think it's best you just... move on.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Right. Move on. 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"What's that?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Hur livin' a lah, Timmih. 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"A present? You got me a p-present?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"... Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent.  If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh?  Wow, a parka.  You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Tim-Timmy.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits.  This is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim. Well, I'll see you around. 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
5,2,Jimbo,"There he is! Kill him! Kill him!  Oh, wait, that's not him. 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Thanks again, Tim-Tim.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Tim-Timmay!
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Ah, bye, Scouts.  Okay, okay, Marc, stop playing now.
"
5,2,Marc,"Hey, don't yell at me! Ya asked me to come over and play sad songs for you to pack to, and then ya yell at me.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"I'm sorry. Sorry. But now I've packed everything away, so just... well, play something uplifting, like... ""I'm gonna put all this behind me and make it okay"" music.
"
5,2,Marc,"Ooooh, I don't want her. You can have her. She's too fat for me.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Oh!  Jesus, Marc.
"
5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Parents, this is the new Scout leader, Mr. Grazier. He will be taking over for the homosexual.
"
5,2,Randy,"Nice to meet you.
"
5,2,Mr. Grazier,"Marsh, right? We actually kind of know each other. Your wife and mine are friends.
"
5,2,Stuart,"Your wife, huh?
"
5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Carol is the head of a girls' Mountain Scouts troop.
"
5,2,Randy,"Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then.
"
5,2,Mr. Grazier,"Gonna go pound some brews, huh?
"
5,2,Jimmy,"And so I said to him, ""Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf.""  Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmay.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too.  Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat.  Just for a second, Timmy.  Don't be a jerk, Timmy.  Hey, don't push me!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
5,2,Cartman,"Cripple fight! 
"
5,2,Mr. Grazier,"That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats! 
"
5,2,Cartman,"Awww!
"
5,2,Mr. Grazier,"Alright, Scouts, I am your new Scout Master, Mr. Grazier!  Together we are going to become the best! The sleekest! The most polished Scout troop in all of Colorado! Isn't that right!  When I ask you a question you will answer ""Yes, Scoutmaster!"" Do I make myself clear?!
"
5,2,Scouts,"Yes, Scoutmaster!
"
5,2,Mr. Grazier,"Good! Now, the first activity for this evening will be...  naked pictures  I'm going to take some pictures of each of you naked, in case we need them, for later.
"
5,2,Scouts,"Awww.
"
5,2,Mr. Grazier,"Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! ""We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!""
"
5,2,Cartman,"Man, this guy sucks.
"
5,2,Mr. Grazier,"Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts!
"
5,2,Mr. Grazier,"Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this meeting with a little puppet show.  Here's a little Scout. He's always prepared. He's always ready. Now, here's a little Scout telling his parents that Mr. Grazier took naked pictures of him. Look what happens.  Oh! No! Aw! Aw! Aw!  Do I make myself clear, Scouts?!
"
5,2,Scouts,"Yes, Scoutmaster! 
"
5,2,Mr. Grazier,"Oh, hello parents. Alright, that's all the time we have for tonight, Scouts. We sure had a great time, didn't we?
"
5,2,Scouts,"Yes sir Scoutmaster! 
"
5,2,Randy,"Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape.
"
5,2,Stuart,"Yeah. Now they're acting like men.
"
5,2,Mr. Grazier,"Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside.
"
5,2,Randy,"You bet.
"
5,2,Stuart,"I heard that.
"
5,2,Randy,"See ya, Mr. Grazier. 
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Go away! I'm dead! 
"
5,2,Butters,"Oh, well, here he is.
"
5,2,Stan,"Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!
"
5,2,Cartman,"Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts.
"
5,2,Stan,"Kicked out? Oh no!
"
5,2,Cartman,"But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Really? wull-why?
"
5,2,Butters,"We can't tell you.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Why not?
"
5,2,Butters,"Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! 
"
5,2,Stan,"Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much.
"
5,2,Stan,"What do we want?
"
5,2,Boys,"Gays in Scouts!
"
5,2,Stan,"When do we want it?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
5,2,Stan,"What do we want?
"
5,2,Boys,"Gays in Scouts!
"
5,2,Stan,"When do we want it?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
5,2,Stan,"What do we want?
"
5,2,Randy,"Oh, no.
"
5,2,Boys,"Gays in Scouts!
"
5,2,Stan,"When do we want it?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
5,2,Stan,"What do we want?
"
5,2,Boys,"Gays in Scouts!
"
5,2,Stan,"When do we want it?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
5,2,Stan,"Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. 
"
5,2,Little Girl,"Puppies. Puppies for sale.
"
5,2,Cartman,"Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! 
"
5,2,Stan,"Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit! 
"
5,2,Butters,"Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?
"
5,2,Stan,"That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Wow, what a great audience. For my first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer. Come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Put on the hat!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Pu-put it on!!
"
5,2,Stan,"Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih. Timmih.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Not this year.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih, Timmh.
"
5,2,Cartman,"Cripple fight!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Haaa.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Come on. Come on!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
5,2,Cartman,"Cripple fight! 
"
5,2,Cartman,"Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside! 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Come on!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Uh.
"
5,2,Stan,"Jesus Christ, dude! 
"
5,2,Susan,"Oh my God!
"
5,2,Man 5,"Just let 'em have it out, Susan. They'll run out of steam soon. 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Hahnah Timmih.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Huah!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Hahnah Timmih.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Come on!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"No!  Ow!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Timmy? Timmy? I told you to put on the HAT!!  You dirty motherfucker! 
"
5,2,Man 5,"What's goin' on?
"
5,2,Man 6,"Some kind of gay pride rally.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Lah-livin' a lie!
"
5,2,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice.
"
5,2,Farmer,"Those boys have shown me the light. I never knew the Mountain Scouts was a hate group.
"
5,2,Joe,"This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!
"
5,2,Randy,"Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off.
"
5,2,Reporter,"The rally has also caught the attention of old Scouts members, like Steven Spielberg, director of such films as Always and 1941.
"
5,2,Steven Spielberg,"I salute those boys and their courage. I am hereby cutting all my funding to the Scouts!
"
5,2,Reporter,"The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred.
"
5,2,Gloria Allred,"It is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate.  I am taking this case on, personally!
"
5,2,Reporter,"With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you.
"
5,2,Tom,"Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist.  This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now.
"
5,2,Tom,"Here's one. And here's another.
"
5,2,Stuart,"Kenny?
"
5,2,Randy,"Oh my God.
"
5,2,Tom,"Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here.
"
5,2,Man 6,"Alright, boys, break it up.
"
5,2,Bailiff,"All rise.
"
5,2,Chief Justice,"In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts must allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club!
"
5,2,Crowd,"Alright! Yeah! Woohoo! 
"
5,2,Randy,"Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.
"
5,2,Crowd,"Yeah! 
"
5,2,Chief Justice,"And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast!
"
5,2,Crowd,"Hooray, yeah, yeah! 
"
5,2,Stan,"We did it! We did it!
"
5,2,Gloria Allred,"I did it! I did it! Haha! 
"
5,2,Gloria Allred,"Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are.  And we all it all to me, and these six brave little boys  five... brave little boys. And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al. 
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Thank you all very much. But I don't want this. 
"
5,2,Crowd members,"What's he saying?
"
5,2,Stan,"Huh?
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Look, I appreciate what you kids did; I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If I'm free to express myself, then the Scouts have to be free to express themselves, too. I know these men. They are good men. They are kind men. They do what they think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I love them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club.
"
5,2,Man,"Uh, Hooray!
"
5,2,Another Man,"Hooray, hey!
"
5,2,Stan,"So wait, did we do good?
"
5,2,Butters,"Uh yeah, ah I think so.
"
5,2,Cartman,"Eh, we kick ass.
"
5,2,Big Gay Al,"Come on kids, let's go get some ice cream! 
"
5,2,Gloria Allred,"You can't do this! You homophobe!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts. 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Tim-mih.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih.  Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih.  Aaaaah.
"
5,2,Stan,"Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! 
"
5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Alright, boys, I am your new Scout leader. Everything is going to be just fine. No naked pictures.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Uh, Timmih.
"
5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Yes, Timmy?  Oh dear. Jimmy?
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Yes?
"
5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"You know our policy: I'm afraid you're... out of Scouts.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Out of Scouts? 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Tim-mih.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"What?  Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!
"
5,2,Stan,"Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.
"
5,2,Butters,"Me neither. 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"No! No! 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
5,3,Magician,"Okay, Carol, put the card you picked back into the deck so I can't see ittwah. 
"
5,3,Stan,"What's going on? 
"
5,3,Butters,"Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?
"
5,3,Blaine,"Okay, now hold this card up to the crowd.  Was that the card you picked?
"
5,3,Carol,"No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of hearts.
"
5,3,Blaine,"Four of hearts? Really? Look again.
"
5,3,Carol,"Daa-ah!
"
5,3,Crowd,"Oooohhhh! 
"
5,3,Woman,"Whoa
"
5,3,Kyle,"That's pretty cool, dude!
"
5,3,Cartman,"Who's this asshole?
"
5,3,Kyle,"He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
"
5,3,Blaine,"Sir, c- could you come over here?  Now, what I want you to do, Mr...
"
5,3,Jimbo,"Kern.
"
5,3,Blaine,"Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think about a card. Pick any card, and picture it in your mind.
"
5,3,Jimbo,"O-kay.
"
5,3,Blaine,"Okay, jus... s think about your card.  okay, look at me.  Look at me... Look at me... okay, now reach up your ass.
"
5,3,Jimbo,"Huh??
"
5,3,Blaine,"Go on, reach up your ass.
"
5,3,Jimbo,"Uh, I don't feel nothin'.
"
5,3,Blaine,"Deeper.
"
5,3,Jimbo,"Hhud. I don't feel... hello... wait... wait... 
"
5,3,Blaine,"Was that the card you picked?
"
5,3,Jimbo,"Yes! Oh my God!
"
5,3,Man,"O-hoho! 
"
5,3,Kyle,"Wow, that's cool!
"
5,3,Stan,"How'd he do that??
"
5,3,Blaine,"Thank you. I've been traveling from town to town for quite a while. I've started quite a following, mostly because of my levitation tricktwah. Watch.  Watch. 
"
5,3,Crowd,"Whoa!!!
"
5,3,Stan,"No way!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
"
5,3,Blaintologist,"Pamphlet. Pamphlet. Here you go, kids,  take a pamphlet. 
"
5,3,Kyle,"""David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!
"
5,3,Speaker,"Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and I've been a Blaintologist for about three years. So, when David Blaine performed his miracles out on the street, what moved you the most?
"
5,3,Stan,"His a-miracles?
"
5,3,Steven,"Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader.
"
5,3,Cartman,"When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
"
5,3,Stan,"Yeah!
"
5,3,Steven,"Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?
"
5,3,Butters,"I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
"
5,3,Steven,"...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-
"
5,3,Butters,"And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
"
5,3,Steven,"Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you?  You're not really happy.
"
5,3,Kyle,"I'm not really happy.
"
5,3,Steven,"Your potential hasn't even been reached.
"
5,3,Kyle,"My potential hasn't even been reached.
"
5,3,Steven,"If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we?
"
5,3,Cartman,"Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
"
5,3,Steven,"That's right.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Cool.
"
5,3,Sheila,"Ike, eat your gefilte fish. 
"
5,3,Ike,"No-oo.
"
5,3,Kyle,"Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
"
5,3,Sheila,"That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!
"
5,3,Kyle,"We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
"
5,3,Sheila,"Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.
"
5,3,Kyle,"So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
"
5,3,Sheila,"Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father.  Ike, you will eat this!
"
5,3,Barber,"Prepare to be cleansed and release the magic inside you.
"
5,3,Butters,"I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.
"
5,3,Barber,"Next? 
"
5,3,Steven,"Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean.  Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head.
"
5,3,Recruits,"Wow!
"
5,3,Steven,"So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize! 
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.
"
5,3,Butters,"Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.
"
5,3,Stan,"No, I'm Stan.
"
5,3,Kyle,"You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
"
5,3,Stan,"Who are you?
"
5,3,Kyle,"I'm Kyle.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Heheh, guess who I am, guys?
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.
"
5,3,Kyle,"What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
"
5,3,Stan,"Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
"
5,3,Kyle,"But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..
"
5,3,Stan,"I don't care! I'm leaving!  'Scuse me. 
"
5,3,Aide,"Where are you going?
"
5,3,Stan,"I'm going home.
"
5,3,Aide,"You don't want to go home.
"
5,3,Stan,"You said we're free to leave whenever we want
"
5,3,Aide,"You are.
"
5,3,Stan,"Move out of the way.
"
5,3,Aide,"I'm not in the way. You are. Are you unhappy with the Church's teachings? Let's just talk about it
"
5,3,Stan,"I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.
"
5,3,Aide,"Why don't we go into the back room for a second, and talk? Then you can leave.
"
5,3,Stan,"That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.
"
5,3,Aide,"That's great news. 
"
5,3,Stan,"Okay, it's all clear. 
"
5,3,Kyle,"What are we doing?
"
5,3,Stan,"We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
"
5,3,Kyle,"Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.
"
5,3,Stan,"Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!
"
5,3,Kyle,"It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
"
5,3,Stan,"A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
"
5,3,Stan,"No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!
"
5,3,Kyle,"I'm not going anywhere!
"
5,3,Stan,"Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
"
5,3,Stan,"Oh wait, who am I again?
"
5,3,Kyle,"You're Stan.
"
5,3,Stan,"Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. 
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle, please. You-  You're my best friend.
"
5,3,Kyle,"Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 
"
5,3,Kyle,"Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
"
5,3,Elderly Woman,"Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
"
5,3,Kyle,"That's right.
"
5,3,Elderly Woman,"So you're not a cult?
"
5,3,Cartman,"Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.
"
5,3,Elderly Woman,"Well, alright, come on in.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Cool. 
"
5,3,Kyle,"...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?
"
5,3,Elderly Woman,"No, not really.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
"
5,3,Kyle,"David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
"
5,3,Cartman,"He's going to eat his own head.
"
5,3,Kyle,"How many tickets can we put you down for?
"
5,3,Elderly Woman,"Oh, I can't go.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
"
5,3,Elderly Woman,"I am happy.
"
5,3,Cartman,"No you're not.
"
5,3,Elderly Woman,"Yes I am.
"
5,3,Cartman,"No you're not.
"
5,3,Elderly Woman,"I really am.
"
5,3,Cartman,"No you're not.
"
5,3,Elderly Woman,"But I am.
"
5,3,Cartman,"No you're not.
"
5,3,Elderly Woman,"Alright, two tickets
"
5,3,Kyle,"Great!
"
5,3,Kyle,"That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
"
5,3,Kyle,"I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
"
5,3,Cartman,"Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. 
"
5,3,Stan,"HaaAAAA! 
"
5,3,Driver,"You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner! 
"
5,3,Stan,"Hi, Jesus. It's me,
"
5,3,"Stan, Jesus","Stan Marsh.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Of course. I know you, my child. Come in.
"
5,3,Stan,"This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
"
5,3,Jesus,"You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.
"
5,3,Stan,"I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.
"
5,3,Jesus,"The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.
"
5,3,Stan,"Can you do it again?
"
5,3,Jesus,"Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around.  Er, nuh, tur- turn around.  Uh, okay now, turn back.  It is now wine!
"
5,3,Stan,"That's it? That's how you did that trick?
"
5,3,Jesus,"Wuh well, yeah.
"
5,3,Stan,"That trick sucks, Jesus.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago.
"
5,3,Stan,"Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Then let's go.
"
5,3,Stan,"But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Oh,don't worry  I have a few more miracles up my sleeve.
"
5,3,Kyle,"This is a really good turnout.
"
5,3,Announcer,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, David Blaine. 
"
5,3,Blaine,"Hello, my children.
"
5,3,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, may we have silence, please, as magician David Blaine will now eat... his... own... head. 
"
5,3,Kyle,"Dude, no way! 
"
5,3,Blaine,"Thank you, everyone.  Our organization grows larger every day. Soon, the government will even have to give us tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Hold!
"
5,3,Man,"It's Jesus! 
"
5,3,Cartman,"What's he doin' here? 
"
5,3,Jesus,"My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle!  Behold! I have here fives loaves of bread and three fish. Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around  Ya need tuh- turn around.  Okay, now turn back. 
"
5,3,Cartman,"Now how the hell did he do that? 
"
5,3,Crowd,"Wow!
"
5,3,Blaine,"Your magic is old and outdated, Jesus! Twah. Just like you are.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Oh, really. Then what's this  Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?
"
5,3,Crowd,"Whoa. 
"
5,3,Jesus,"Jesus Christ!
"
5,3,Elderly Woman,"He's incredible!
"
5,3,Blaine,"The old religions have failed you! Twah. What have they offered except for war, poverty, and sadness? Blaintology offers you the key to living your life to the fullest! Will you join us?
"
5,3,Crowd,"Yes!!
"
5,3,Jesus,"His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it.
"
5,3,Stan,"Then what are we going to do.
"
5,3,Jesus,"I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends.  Buddha. Buddha, come in!
"
5,3,Stan,"Super best friends?
"
5,3,Buddha,"This is Buddha, Jesus. Go ahead.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before.
"
5,3,Buddha,"I'll call everyone together. Come as fast as you can.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long.
"
5,3,Stan,"To where?
"
5,3,Jesus,"Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes.
"
5,3,Stan,"I am ready.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Are you still keeping your eyes closed?
"
5,3,Stan,"Yeah.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Good. Want some peanuts?
"
5,3,Kyle,"Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
"
5,3,Steven,"Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round! I have great news for all Blaintologists, and for our new members as well. We've just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself: The government has denied our church's request for tax-exempt status!
"
5,3,Member,"But... we want tax-exempt status.
"
5,3,Kyle,"Yeah. Why is that good news?
"
5,3,Steven,"Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blaintologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and demand our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Mass suicide?
"
5,3,Steven,"Mr. Blaine has said that by killing ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife!
"
5,3,Member,"Hehehe, that sounds good. 
"
5,3,Steven,"Get your things ready. We leave for Washington at dawn!
"
5,3,Cartman,"Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!
"
5,3,Jesus,"Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now.  This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right.
"
5,3,Mohammad,"Jesus, we've been working hard since we got your distress call!
"
5,3,Loa Tse,"Who the kid?
"
5,3,Jesus,"Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends : Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammad, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame ; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet; Lao Tse, the found of Taoism ; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish.
"
5,3,Stan,"So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?
"
5,3,Mohammad,"More than friends, young boy, we are super best friends, with the desire to fight for justice.
"
5,3,Joseph Smith,"We all believe in the power of good over evil. Except for Buddha, of course, who doesn't believe in evil. 
"
5,3,Stan,"Wow.
"
5,3,Mohammad,"Jesus, come look at this.  After your distress call, we entered David Blaine in the super best friends' computer.
"
5,3,Seaman,"Many interesting things showed up. He was raised in New York city by a decent family, but a freak washing-machine accident at the age of 12 made him learn the ways of the black arts.
"
5,3,Buddha,"That's right, Seamen. 
"
5,3,Seaman,"Sea Man!
"
5,3,Buddha,"Uh that's what I said. Seamen. 
"
5,3,Seaman,"Stop it!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!
"
5,3,Cartman,"No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? 
"
5,3,Kyle,"It's just me.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
"
5,3,Kyle,"Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
"
5,3,Cartman,"What?
"
5,3,Kyle,"I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.
"
5,3,Kyle,"I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
"
5,3,Cartman,"That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.
"
5,3,Kyle,"Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 
"
5,3,Cartman,"I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
"
5,3,Kyle,"What have you done, Cartman?!
"
5,3,Cartman,"This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.
"
5,3,Blaine,"You must understand, brother Kyle, twah, you know too much about the Church. If you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
"
5,3,Kyle,"Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!
"
5,3,Cartman,"At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
"
5,3,Blaine,"The suicide pact will go as planned. If we die, we all die together. 
"
5,3,Narrator,"Meanwhile, at the Hall of Super Best Friends...
"
5,3,Joseph Smith,"Look at that, Jesus. His followers are growing at a rate even faster than mine! It appears this David Blaine is as dangerous as you and your young friend had feared.
"
5,3,Stan,"I knew it.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night.
"
5,3,Joseph Smith,"Perhaps we should have Moses look at the tape and see what he comes up with. 
"
5,3,Mohammad,"Moses, scan this tape. Can you tell us the source of Blaine's power?
"
5,3,Moses,"Give me the information. 
"
5,3,Stan,"Wow, the Moses.
"
5,3,Moses,"His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand. Wait a minute: I'm picking up movement from Blaintologists from all over the country.
"
5,3,Lao Tse,"The Blaintologists are heading to Washington. But why?
"
5,3,Jesus,"Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status.
"
5,3,Joseph Smith,"Omigod!
"
5,3,Lao Tse,"What?
"
5,3,Joseph Smith,"If he gets tax-exempt status, then he'll become a real religion.
"
5,3,Krishna,"He would become unstoppable
"
5,3,Narrator,"Meanwhile, in the nation's capital, Blaintologists from all over the country have gathered to commit mass suicide!
"
5,3,Blaine,"If the government will not give us tax-exempt status, then we must prove that we are willing to die for our beliefs, twah.
"
5,3,Steven,"Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around.  It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool!  However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such. 
"
5,3,Man,"Next! 
"
5,3,Narrator,"Meanwhile, at the White House...
"
5,3,Karl Rove,"Mr. President, we can't let them all kill themselves!
"
5,3,George Bush,"Well we can't give them tax-exempt status either, Karl!
"
5,3,Larry,"He-e-ey George! What's gon' on?
"
5,3,Cartman,"Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! 
"
5,3,Kyle,"Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
"
5,3,Cartman,"But it's the only way for us to be happy. 
"
5,3,Kyle,"Cartman, no!
"
5,3,Blaine,"Give us what we want or we will continue to die
"
5,3,Jesus,"Not so fast, David Blaine!
"
5,3,Blaine,"Jesus! Not again.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends! 
"
5,3,Buddha,"Buddha!
"
5,3,Mohammad,"Mohammad!
"
5,3,Joseph Smith,"Joseph Smith!
"
5,3,Krishna,"Krishna!
"
5,3,Lao Tse,"Lao Tse!
"
5,3,Seaman,"Sea-Man!
"
5,3,Jesus,"The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And so are you!
"
5,3,Blaine,"I don't think so. Get them! 
"
5,3,Joseph Smith,"My ice breath should take care of you. 
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle! Kyle!
"
5,3,Blaintologist,"Sweet Salvation! 
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
5,3,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
5,3,Kyle,"You bastards! 
"
5,3,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
5,3,Jesus,"That takes care of them.
"
5,3,Joseph Smith,"Now it's your turn, Blaine!
"
5,3,Blaine,"Perhaps you need to see some real magic. 
"
5,3,Lincoln,"Raaargh! 
"
5,3,Buddha,"Oh this looks like trouble.
"
5,3,Blaine,"So long, Super Best Fools!
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Stan!
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle, you can't kill yourself!
"
5,3,Kyle,"I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! 
"
5,3,Jesus,"We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad!  Great Scott!
"
5,3,Cartman,"Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep .
"
5,3,Mohammad,"It is too powerful, Jesus!
"
5,3,Krishna,"It seems to have no weakness!
"
5,3,Jesus,"There has to be a way to destroy it.  Jesus to Moses!
"
5,3,Narrator,"Meanwhile, at the Super Best Friends League...
"
5,3,Jesus,"Come in, Moses!
"
5,3,Moses,"What?
"
5,3,Jesus,"We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.
"
5,3,Moses,"...Um... Let me think, um... a giant stone John Wilkes Booth?
"
5,3,Jesus,"You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth!
"
5,3,Mohammad,"Krishna, we're going to need wood for a mold!
"
5,3,Krishna,"Form of... a beaver! 
"
5,3,Mohammad,"I will find sources to concrete.  You, get the water to mix it with, Seaman. 
"
5,3,Narrator,"Using the wood that Krishna cut down as a beaver, Jesus uses his master carpentry skills to make a giant mold.
"
5,3,Jesus,"That should do the trick. Now for some concrete.
"
5,3,Narrator,"Meanwhile, in the ocean depths, Seaman seeks out water to mix with the concrete.
"
5,3,Seaman,"Sea-Man!  Look, Swallow, we should be able to divert the water with that pipe.
"
5,3,Narrator,"And so, Seaman and Swallow get to... get to work 
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny! 
"
5,3,Jesus,"Lao Tse, bring it to life. 
"
5,3,Narrator,"Using his power of Taoism, Lao Tse becomes one with the giant stone John Wilkes Booth. 
"
5,3,Kyle,"Wagh. 
"
5,3,Jesus,"It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves! 
"
5,3,Cartman,"Hey, I was just about to do it.
"
5,3,Narrator,"Later, at exactly the same location...
"
5,3,Blaine,"Damn you, Super Best Friends!
"
5,3,Jesus,"Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine!
"
5,3,Blaine,"Then I guess you win this time, Super Best Fools! But I'll be back! 
"
5,3,Jesus,"Goddamnit! 
"
5,3,Buddha,"It's alright. Everything is as it should be.
"
5,3,Jesus,"Oh, shut up, Buddha!
"
5,3,Steven,"Our leader, he... he's leaving us! 
"
5,3,Blaintologist,"Don't leave us, David Blaine!
"
5,3,Stan,"Listen up, everyone!  You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.
"
5,3,Blaintologist,"He's right. He... he's right! 
"
5,3,Kyle,"Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
"
5,3,Stan,"Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Oh, that's so sweet you guys.  You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh 
"
5,3,Kyle,"Haha, hehahaha.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Ah!  Ow, stop it!  Ah! 
"
5,3,Jesus,"Well, it looks like everything worked out. 
"
5,3,Narrator,"And so, Jesus and his companions leave Washington. But their return is assured, for there will always be a need for... the Super Best Friends!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?
"
5,4,Kyle,"What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.
"
5,4,Stan,"What's no big deal?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
"
5,4,Kyle,"...What the hell are you talking about?!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! 
"
5,4,Kenny,"(You got pubes??)
"
5,4,Kyle,"What's ""pubes""?
"
5,4,Stan,"Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Oh.  No you didn't!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
"
5,4,Stan,"He's lying. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"You wanna see 'em?
"
5,4,Kyle,"Hell no! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Here, check 'em out.
"
5,4,Stan,"We don't wanna see them, Cartman! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"There, see?! How do you like them apples!  HA!
"
5,4,Kyle,"Uh what are those? 
"
5,4,Cartman,"My pubes.
"
5,4,Stan,"What??
"
5,4,Cartman,"I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! 
"
5,4,Stan,"Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't mean we can't still hang out.  It just means that I matured faster than you.  You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Uh oo what?
"
5,4,Stan,"When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Nuh uh!
"
5,4,Kyle,"Yuh huh!
"
5,4,Cartman,"But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
"
5,4,Kyle,"Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
"
5,4,Cartman,"You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
"
5,4,Scott,"And so I told him, I said ""Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks."" And this stupid asshole buys them! 
"
5,4,Another boy,"Oh man! 
"
5,4,Scott,"Speak of the devil! What do you want?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
"
5,4,Scott,"Uh uh, I don't take returns!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
"
5,4,Scott,"You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Just give me back my money...
"
5,4,Scott,"Buyer beware, dude!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
"
5,4,Scott,"Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.
"
5,4,Scott,"You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...
"
5,4,Scott,"Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
"
5,4,Cartman,"You will? Oh, cool!
"
5,4,Scott,"How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents.
"
5,4,Scott,"Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars.  And then I'll... give you the twenty.
"
5,4,Cartman,"...Okay.
"
5,4,Scott,"Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Right.
"
5,4,Scott,"Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Cool.
"
5,4,Scott,"And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Sweet!  Uh. Oh, goddamnit!
"
5,4,Cartman,"That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!
"
5,4,Kyle,"Cartman, can I give you some advice?
"
5,4,Cartman,"What?!
"
5,4,Kyle,"Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
"
5,4,Cartman,"He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! 
"
5,4,Kyle,"One please.
"
5,4,Stan,"One please.
"
5,4,Kenny,"(One please.)
"
5,4,Cartman,"One please. 
"
5,4,Clerk,"That'll be six dollars.
"
5,4,Cartman,"O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?
"
5,4,Clerk,"We don't take pubes!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.
"
5,4,Clerk,"We don't take pubes!! End of story!!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Racist! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!
"
5,4,Scott,"Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!
"
5,4,Cartman,"What?
"
5,4,Scott,"Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Wha-? Uh oo  why do you want then back so much?
"
5,4,Scott,"No reason.
"
5,4,Cartman,"I don't believe you.
"
5,4,Scott,"Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Pube fair?
"
5,4,Scott,"They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
"
5,4,Scott,"Hehere, take your money!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!
"
5,4,Scott,"Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Haha, charade you are, Scott! 
"
5,4,Scott,"Have you no heart??
"
5,4,Cartman,"Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.
"
5,4,Man,"Yes?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Can you tell me where the pube fair is?
"
5,4,Man,"The pube fair?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.
"
5,4,Man,"There's no such thing, you little smartass! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"No- no such thing?
"
5,4,Teen boy,"Hey, you wouldn't happen to be Eric Karp-man, would you?
"
5,4,Cartman,"I'm Eric Cartman!
"
5,4,Teen boy,"Well, I think this is for you. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Aaah!!!
"
5,4,Cartman,"A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here
"
5,4,Scott,"You really went? What a 'tard.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.
"
5,4,Scott,"You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...
"
5,4,Scott,"Your grandma?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.
"
5,4,Scott,"Oh.  Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yeah. Poor grandma...
"
5,4,Scott,"Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. 
"
5,4,Scott,"Here you go.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! 
"
5,4,Scott,"But... just one thing before I give it to you:
"
5,4,Cartman,"What?
"
5,4,Scott,"I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Huh?
"
5,4,Scott,"Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Why??
"
5,4,Scott,"Do you want your grandma to live or not?!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Please Scott give me my money.
"
5,4,Scott,"Nono, get down on your knees.  Lower your head , and say ""I beg you to give me back my money.""
"
5,4,Cartman,"I beg you to give me back my money.
"
5,4,Scott,"Now say, ""I'm a little piggy.""
"
5,4,Cartman,"What?!
"
5,4,Scott,"Say it!
"
5,4,Cartman,"I'm a little piggy.
"
5,4,Scott,"""Here's my snout.""
"
5,4,Cartman,"Here's my snout.
"
5,4,Scott,"""Oink oink oink.""
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oink oink oink.
"
5,4,Scott,"Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!
"
5,4,Cartman,"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!
"
5,4,Scott,"You mean this?  You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?! My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"What- What are you doing??  No!.. wuh...why?
"
5,4,Scott,"Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming.  I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all!  Yes, Clyde!
"
5,4,Clyde,"Who's Scott Tenorman?
"
5,4,Kids,"Yeah.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
"
5,4,Butters,"Wuh what are you gonna do?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Did you guys see that movie ""Hannibal""? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
"
5,4,Kyle,"What's in it for us?
"
5,4,Cartman,"What?
"
5,4,Stan,"Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!""  Now who's with me?!! 
"
5,4,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!
"
5,4,Timmy,"Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it.  Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that.
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!
"
5,4,Cartman,"No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. 
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.
"
5,4,Cartman,"He said it was okay.
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Not like that, pony! 
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Whattayou mean?
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
"
5,4,Cartman,"How do I do that?
"
5,4,Jimbo,"What do you see? 
"
5,4,Cartman,"I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
"
5,4,Jimbo,"No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Oo what's a Radiohead?
"
5,4,Cartman,"You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...
"
5,4,Ned,"Mmuh what am I doing here?
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!
"
5,4,Cartman,"So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Nice thinking, young hunter.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Whoa!
"
5,4,Jimbo,"What?
"
5,4,Cartman,"I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
"
5,4,Jimbo,"What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!
"
5,4,Ned,"Mn let me see.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Radiohead. Yes, of course. 
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!
"
5,4,Ned,"Let me see. Let me see.
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Here you go.  Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?
"
5,4,Ned,"Kinda.
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Well, stop it! 
"
5,4,Mr. Tenorman,"Hey, what the hell are you doing out there?!
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Oh crap!
"
5,4,Mr. Tenorman,"Who's out there?
"
5,4,Jimbo,"Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!
"
5,4,Ned,"I can't.
"
5,4,Mr. Tenorman,"Don't think I don't see you! I know who you are and I'm calling the police! 
"
5,4,A man,"Whoa, I gotta get out of here! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?
"
5,4,Scott,"Uh huh.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone's gonna be there!
"
5,4,Scott,"Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.
"
5,4,Cartman,"You're welcome, Scott. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? 
"
5,4,Kurt Loder,"Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now.  Guys, when is the next album coming out?
"
5,4,Cartman,"That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? 
"
5,4,Kurt Loder,"And will there be a new tour?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it! 
"
5,4,Scott,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"'""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""' 
"
5,4,Stan,"Oh my God, he killed Kenny.
"
5,4,Cartman,"That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! 
"
5,4,Kyle,"Okay, Cartman, what do you want?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
"
5,4,Stan,"Got what all figured out?
"
5,4,Cartman,"How to get Scott Tenorman back!
"
5,4,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus!
"
5,4,Cartman,"I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. 
"
5,4,Kyle,"Okay, so what's the plan?
"
5,4,Cartman,"It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?
"
5,4,Stan,"Yeah.
"
5,4,Cartman,"So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! 
"
5,4,Kyle,"...What?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! 
"
5,4,Kyle,"You're such a dumbass, Cartman. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!! 
"
5,4,Johnny,"Thom, will you stop reading fan mail? We have work to do.
"
5,4,Thom,"Just a second, fellas. Listen to this:
Dear Radiohead, My name is Eric Cartman. I'm a young, supple eight-year-old boy from South Park, Colorado. I am writing to you because of a kid I know named Scott Tenorman. Scott is fifteen, and I'm afraid he has cancer. In his ass. Radiohead is his favorite band, and it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won't you please consider it? I don't think he'll make it past... next Tuesday around 5.
"
5,4,Phil,"Wow, we have to go.
"
5,4,Ed,"To Colorado? But we have an album to mix.
"
5,4,Thom,"Didn't you hear the letter?? This poor kid has cancer! In his ass!
"
5,4,Scott,"Hello?
"
5,4,Kyle,"Scott Tenorman?
"
5,4,Scott,"What do you want?!
"
5,4,Kyle,"We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
"
5,4,Scott,"How do you know?
"
5,4,Kyle,"'Cause, we're his friends.
"
5,4,Scott,"Thennn why are you telling me?
"
5,4,Kyle,"'Cause we hate him.
"
5,4,Scott,"Oh.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
"
5,4,Scott,"See ya. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hello, Scott!
"
5,4,Scott,"Hey.
"
5,4,Cartman,"I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!
"
5,4,Scott,"Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!
"
5,4,Scott,"Wow, a pony ride. Neat.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.
"
5,4,Scott,"Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?
"
5,4,Cartman,"A little penis-biting, perhaps?
"
5,4,Scott,"What?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
"
5,4,Scott,"How can I turn it down?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. 
"
5,4,Scott,"Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.
"
5,4,Mrs. Tenorman,"Oh dear.
"
5,4,Scott,"Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do.
"
5,4,Mr. Tenorman,"Well, don't you worry, Scott. Your mom and I can go get the pony and have it taken to an animal shelter.
"
5,4,Mrs. Tenorman,"We sure can.
"
5,4,Scott,"Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now.
"
5,4,Mrs. Tenorman,"Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you.
"
5,4,Scott,"I'm proud of you, too, Mom.
"
5,4,Mrs. Tenorman,"Let's go, hon. 
"
5,4,Mr. Tenorman,"Let's. 
"
5,4,Buddy 1,"What are you doing, Scott?
"
5,4,Scott,"What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
"
5,4,Buddy 2,"We got everyone we could find to chip in.  There are pubes from just about every single kid in town.
"
5,4,Scott,"Awesome! 
"
5,4,Buddy 1,"Oh, dude!
"
5,4,Scott,"The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
"
5,4,Buddy 2,"Yeah! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!
"
5,4,Stan,"This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!
"
5,4,Kyle,"Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"What's so funny?
"
5,4,Stan,"Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Not yet, but they will be.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Yeah, sure. 
"
5,4,Chef,"Hello, Eric!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hey, Chef.
"
5,4,Chef,"I made some chili to enter into the contest.
"
5,4,Cartman,"What contest?
"
5,4,Chef,"This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.
"
5,4,Chef,"It's my special recipe.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! 
"
5,4,Scott,"Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!
"
5,4,Scott,"Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
"
5,4,Scott,"Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!
"
5,4,Scott,"Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. 
"
5,4,Scott,"Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Alright.  Hey, this is great! 
"
5,4,Scott,"Eh, it's a special recipe.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Gawh, this is really good, Scott!
"
5,4,Scott,"I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.
"
5,4,Cartman,"What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? 
"
5,4,Scott,"What?!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. 
"
5,4,Mr. Denkins,"Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I, I have my rights.
"
5,4,Scott,"My... mom and dad are... dead? 
"
5,4,Cartman,"I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili.""
"
5,4,Scott,"Oh my God!  Oh my God!! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! 
"
5,4,Stan,"Jesus Christ, dude!
"
5,4,Scott,"My mom and dad are dead!  No! NOOO!! 
"
5,4,Thom,"Uhm, excuse me?
"
5,4,Stan,"Who are you?
"
5,4,Johnny,"We're that band, Radiohead.
"
5,4,Scott,"Jesus!
"
5,4,Ed,"Jeez, what a li'l crybaby!
"
5,4,Colin,"Are you gonna cry all day, crybaby??
"
5,4,Thom,"You know, everyone has problems; it doesn't mean you have to be a little crybaby about it.
"
5,4,Ed,"Come om, guys, let's go. This kid is totally not cool. 
"
5,4,Thom,"Yeah, that's the most uncool kid I've ever met.
"
5,4,Phil,"Little crybaby!
"
5,4,Scott,"No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!!  Noooo!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
"
5,4,Stan,"Good call.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! 
"
5,5,Announcer,"And so, in her career filled with lies, backstabbing, and whoring herself for money,  she learned that the price of fame can be pleasing 65 men at once in a dark, dirty alley.  And so ends ""Punky Brewster, Behind The Blow.""
"
5,5,Cartman,"Whoa, bummer, dude.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Okay, dude, it's 3:30. 
"
5,5,Announcer 2,"It's time for the Terrance & Phillip Show!
"
5,5,The Boys,"Yay!
"
5,5,Phillip,"Excuse me, buddy.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Why, did you fart?  Oh, no! 
"
5,5,Stan,"Oh man, this is another rerun.
"
5,5,Cartman,"Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
"
5,5,Phillip,"I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?
"
5,5,Terrance,"Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the , and that's how you  get to the auto garage!
"
5,5,Phillip,"Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?
"
5,5,Terrance,"Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass.
"
5,5,Phillip,"No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?
"
5,5,Terrance,"OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.
"
5,5,Phillip,"Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?
"
5,5,Terrance,"You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.
"
5,5,Phillip,"Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?
"
5,5,Stan,"Because I had an itch up my ass.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Because I had an itch up my ass. 
"
5,5,Terrance,"Terrance & Phillip will be right back...
"
5,5,Phillip,"...after these messages. 
"
5,5,Stan,"When are they gonna make new ones?
"
5,5,Announcer 3,"Hey kids, don't miss the greatest event of the year! This Thursday night at the Denver Coliseum, see Terrance and Phillip LIVE! And in person!

5,5,Stan,"What's this?
"

5,5,Kyle,"Oh my God!

5,5,Stan,"Yep. Tomorrow night.
"
5,5,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, children, let's settle down. As you know, this coming Friday is Earth Day.  and I'm pleased to announce that the national Earth Day organization has chosen South Park as its location for the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival.
"
5,5,Class,"Oohh.
"
5,5,Ms. Choksondik,"The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it. 
"
5,5,Older man,"Hello children, I know you're all very excited about having the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival put on in your town.
"
5,5,Younger man,"You care very much about the earth, don't you?
"
5,5,Class,"Yes.
"
5,5,Older man,"Good, because it's up to all of you to get lots of people to come.and make it look great. The festival is on Friday, so we'll start getting it ready tomorrow night. 
"
5,5,Kyle,"What??
"
5,5,Younger man,"We've all gotta pitch in.
"
5,5,Stan,"Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
"
5,5,"Cartman, Kyle, Kenny","Yeah.
"
5,5,Older man,"You... what??
"
5,5,Kyle,"Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
"
5,5,Older man,"And Terrance and Phillip are more important than Mother Earth?
"
5,5,Cartman,"Well yeah, dude.
"
5,5,Older man,"You don't care about Terrance and Phillip.  Nothing matters more than saving the planet from Republicans.  You don't need to see Terrance and Phillip.
"
5,5,Stan,"No, dude, we really, really do.
"
5,5,Older man,"Their will is strong.
"
5,5,Ms. Choksondik,"I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Uhuh, but that's why we're going.
"
5,5,Stan,"Huh?
"
5,5,Kyle,"See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
"
5,5,Younger man,"You can get Terrance and Phillip to perform?  That would be great. Terrance and Phillip would draw huge ratings from children all over the country.
"
5,5,Older man,"Very well, kids; we'll work on getting the event ready here, and you go get Terrance and Phillip.
"
5,5,The Boys,"All right!
"
5,5,Older man,"But I warn you: You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!
"
5,5,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen!  Put your hands together for... Terrance! 
"
5,5,Terrance,"Hellooo, Den-ver! 
"
5,5,Kyle,"Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.
"
5,5,Stan,"Yeah, he looks terrible.
"
5,5,Terrance,"How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh.  Hey, do you all remember this one? ""Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass."" ""Reallih? Let me take a look."" ""Look closer."" 
"
5,5,Stan,"Uuuuhh.
"
5,5,Cartman,"Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
"
5,5,"Cartman, Kyle","Phil-lip!
"
5,5,Audience,"Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip!
"
5,5,Terrance,"And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy! 
"
5,5,Phillip Stand-in,"Hello Terrance.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Hello Phillip.
"
5,5,Stan,"Phillip? That's not Phillip.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Say, Phillip, I have a question for you.
"
5,5,Phillip Stand-in,"Ho-okay, shoot. 
"
5,5,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
"
5,5,Cartman,"I think this new guy's funny.
"
5,5,Terrance,"And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62. 
"
5,5,Phillip Stand-in,"Excuse me, sir. Do you know Who farted?
"
5,5,Terrance,"He sure did.
"
5,5,Phillip Stand-in,"What's the person's name?
"
5,5,Terrance,"Who.
"
5,5,Phillip Stand-in,"The guy that farted!
"
5,5,Terrance,"Who!
"
5,5,Phillip Stand-in,"The person that passed gas!
"
5,5,Terrance,"Who passed gas!
"
5,5,Phillip Stand-in,"Now, why are you asking me?
"
5,5,Terrance,"That's the man's name?
"
5,5,Phillip Stand-in,"That's Who's name?
"
5,5,Terrance,"Yes!
"
5,5,Phillip Stand-in,"Something very terrible has happened in the world of Terrance and Phillip, and we've got to find out what.
"
5,5,Phillip Stand-in,"Look, buddy, all I'm trying to find out is What's the guy's name that farted?
"
5,5,Terrance,"Right, the guy that drank his own urine.
"
5,5,Phillip Stand-in,"Who?
"
5,5,Stan,"Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us.
"
5,5,Bouncer,"Where do you think you're going?
"
5,5,Kyle,"We have to talk to Terrance.
"
5,5,Bouncer,"Hyeah, right.
"
5,5,Stan,"It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
"
5,5,Bouncer,"Then get in the ""Official Presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club"" line. 
"
5,5,Cartman,"Aw, dude, gay!
"
5,5,Stan,"You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
"
5,5,Bouncer,"You and about a thousand other people at one time or another. Now, get out of my face! 
"
5,5,Cartman,"Racist! 
"
5,5,Stan,"Man, this sucks!
"
5,5,Boy in glasses,"Are you guys official presidents, too?
"
5,5,Cartman,"Don't talk to us, kid.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.
"
5,5,Stan,"I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
"
5,5,Cartman,"Kenny's a random slut. 
"
5,5,Kyle,"Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 
"
5,5,Terrance,"Mmm. Mmm, yummy.  Mmm. 
"
5,5,Groupie,"It was so great meeting you. I feel like we really shared something.
"
5,5,Terrance,"We sure did, baby.  Next? 
"
5,5,Obese Woman,"Hello Terrance. I'm such a huuuge fan.
"
5,5,Terrance,"You're a huge fan alright!
"
5,5,Obese Woman,"Can I just have you sign my breasts?
"
5,5,Terrance,"But what do I get in return?
"
5,5,Obese Woman,"Whatever you want. 
"
5,5,Terrance,"Oh yeah.  Oh, that's good, baby.
"
5,5,Obese Woman,"Oh, Terrance, I love you.
"
5,5,Terrance,"You like that? 
"
5,5,Obese Woman,"I love you! 
"
5,5,Terrance,"Yeah.
"
5,5,Obese Woman,"I LOVE you!
"
5,5,Terrance,"Ah good.
"
5,5,Obese Woman,"I LOVE YOU!!
"
5,5,Terrance,"Yeah-
"
5,5,Both,"OH!!! 
"
5,5,Cartman,"Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! 
"
5,5,Terrance,"Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?
"
5,5,Obese woman,"What the hell? 
"
5,5,Terrance,"Oh wow! We had quadruplets! 
"
5,5,Stan,"We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something?
"
5,5,Kyle,"Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?
"
5,5,Stan,"But where's Phillip?
"
5,5,Terrance,"Who?
"
5,5,Kyle,"Phillip, your partner.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, ""Hey, where's Phillip?"" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK!  You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!
"
5,5,Kyle,"But the guy who replaced him sucks!
"
5,5,Terrance,"Ah, I know.  I know he sucks  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?
"
5,5,Stan,"Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Ogh, whatever.  The point is, Phillip and I are through.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money.
"
5,5,Stan,"What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
"
5,5,Terrance,"HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  ""more serious"" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto.
"
5,5,Kenny,"(Toronto?)
"
5,5,Kyle,"But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle. 
"
5,5,Older man,"Work! Work, children! We only have two more days until Earth Day! Work!
"
5,5,Clyde,"Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming.
"
5,5,Older man,"That's not true.  Global warming is going to kill us all.  The Republicans are responsible.
"
5,5,Clyde,"Thank you. 
"
5,5,Stan,"Oh no, dude.
"
5,5,Older man,"Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Uuuh, we didn't get them.
"
5,5,Older man,"You what?
"
5,5,Stan,"They're not together anymore, dude.
"
5,5,Younger man,"You'd better be joking. We've already announced their participation.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
"
5,5,Older man,"You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else!
"
5,5,Stan,"But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
"
5,5,Older man,"Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements.  Nothing is more important than the environment, boys. Not even your lives. 
"
5,5,Kyle,"Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
"
5,5,Cartman,"Weak.
"
5,5,Phillip,"Ahhh 
"
5,5,King Claudius,"Part them; they are incensed.
"
5,5,Hamlet,"Nay, come, again.
"
5,5,Queen Gertrude,"Aaaah! 
"
5,5,Osric,"Look to the queen there, buddih! 
"
5,5,Horatio,"They bleed on both sides.  How is it, my lord?
"
5,5,Osric,"How is't, Laertes?
"
5,5,Laertes,"Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
"
5,5,Hamlet,"How does the queen?
"
5,5,King Claudius,"Hey guy, she swounds to see them bleed, buddih. 
"
5,5,Queen Gertrude,"No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. Blagh! 
"
5,5,Hamlet,"O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.
"
5,5,Laertes,"It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
"
5,5,Hamlet,"The point!--envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work, buddih! 
"
5,5,All,"Treason! treason!
"
5,5,King Claudius,"O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
"
5,5,Hamlet,"Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother.
"
5,5,King Claudius,"Blagh! 
"
5,5,Laertes,"He is served;It is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me. Blagh! 
"
5,5,Hamlet,"Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee, guy. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, buddih, That are but mutes or audience to this act,  Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you, buddih--But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest, guy; report me and my cause aright, to the unsatisfied. 
"
5,5,Horatio,"Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left, buddih.
"
5,5,Stan,"Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? 
"
5,5,Hamlet,"...he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Blagh. 
"
5,5,Horatio,"Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest, buddih!...
"
5,5,Stan,"Phillip! Phillip!
"
5,5,Phillip,"Yes?
"
5,5,Stan,"Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
"
5,5,Phillip,"Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.
"
5,5,Stan,"Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-
"
5,5,Phillip,"AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!
"
5,5,Stan,"But we need you!
"
5,5,Phillip,"Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? 
"
5,5,Cartman,"Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
"
5,5,Phillip,"Yeah, whatever, kid.
"
5,5,Stan,"He'll do it, dude.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
"
5,5,Phillip,"What?
"
5,5,The other boys,"What?
"
5,5,Kyle,"They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day.""
"
5,5,Phillip,"Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?
"
5,5,Stan,"Two thousand dollars.
"
5,5,Phillip,"I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details.  Gotta run! 
"
5,5,Stan,"Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
"
5,5,Kyle,"I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
"
5,5,Cartman,"Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Ih-it'll be okay.
"
5,5,Older man,"Work faster! Faster, children! Earth Day is coming!  Well, boys, it's rehearsal time, and your Terrance and Phillip haven't shown up.
"
5,5,Kyle,"They said they'd come.
"
5,5,Stan,"I'm sure they'll be here any minute.
"
5,5,Older man,"Maybe you kids don't understand how important Earth Day is for the future of our planet. Maybe you need some convincing. Carl? 
"
5,5,Kenny,"(AAAAHH!)
"
5,5,Stan,"Oh my God!
"
5,5,Phillip,"Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?
"
5,5,Kyle,"He's here! 
"
5,5,Older man,"Oh. Very good. Mr. Phillip, I am Jack Farliss, head of the Earth Day Committee. Thank you for being part of this important event.
"
5,5,Phillip,"Whatever. Where's my check? 
"
5,5,Terrance,"Alright, I'm here. Where do I-?
"
5,5,Phillip,"What's HE doing here?
"
5,5,Jack,"Alright, let's do a rehearsal so that the camera crew can get a look at it. 
"
5,5,Kyle,"Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
"
5,5,Stan,"Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.
"
5,5,Phillip,"So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?!
"
5,5,Terrance,"My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
"
5,5,Phillip,"Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!
"
5,5,Terrance,"Ditto!
"
5,5,Stan,"Fine! 
"
5,5,Kyle,"See? I told you it would work. 
"
5,5,Jack,"Alright, we'll come off the speech about the dying whales, and thennn, action!
"
5,5,Terrance,"Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass.
"
5,5,Phillip,"Really? Let me take a look.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Look closer. 
"
5,5,Kyle.,"Haha, hahahaha. Hahaha.
"
5,5,Phillip,"Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-
"
5,5,Terrance,"Uh. What? That's not the line, asshole!
"
5,5,Phillip,"You're right. It's a better one, asshole!
"
5,5,Terrance,"Just do the bit right, dickface!
"
5,5,Phillip,"Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!
"
5,5,Terrance,"I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!
"
5,5,Phillip,"That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!
"
5,5,Terrance,"I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack! 
"
5,5,Kyle,"You can't leave! The show starts soon!
"
5,5,Jack,"Boys, you've got... three hours to get those two back together. Do I need to remind you what will happen if you don't? Carl! 
"
5,5,Kenny,"(OOOWWW!)
"
5,5,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
5,5,Jack,"Good luck, boys. 
"
5,5,Cartman,"We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.
"
5,5,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where Earth Day 2001 is in full force.  Environmental awareness games, booths, and of course,  the entertainment on stage, which is being broadcast live all over the country. This eco-happy crowd is thrilled and waiting in anticipation for the arrival of Terrance and Phillip, who are promised by these four boys. 
"
5,5,Jack,"What a touching and true song. You know, it's true.  Republicans are ruining the earth.
"
5,5,Crowd,"Republicans are ruining the earth.
"
5,5,Jack,"Alright. Well, I think I know why most of you tuned in today. How about some Earth Day entertainment?! 
"
5,5,Kyle,"Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 
"
5,5,Carl,"On video? 
"
5,5,Narrator,"They were considered the best comedy act in all of Canada.  But a fast-paced rocket ride to success would bring them to the depths of despair.  This is Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow.
"
5,5,Crowd,"Wow!
"
5,5,Carl,"What the hell do you call this?! 
"
5,5,Kyle,"Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month.
"
5,5,Jack,"We promised people Terrance and Phillip, not a video documentary! You've ruined the earth for the last time, boys! 
"
5,5,The Boys,"Aaaahh! 
"
5,5,Narrator,"Terrance was born Terrance Henry Stoot, in the small Canadian village of Toronto.  At a very early age his parents noticed an uncanny musical ability and decided to enroll him in the Canadian School for gifted babies.  It was here that he partnered up with Phillip Niles Argyle , a brash young baby from Montreal.  Together, they performed musical acts that stunned Canadians everywhere.  At the tender age of six, Terrance and Phillip were off to the United States to perform on the Ed Sullivan show . where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time.
"
5,5,Ed Sullivan,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have two adorable little boys from Canada. Please put your hands together for the music of young Terrance and Phillip. 
"
5,5,Terrance & Phillip,"Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
"
5,5,Woman,"Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!
"
5,5,Man,"It's alright, darling, they're just Canadian.
"
5,5,Woman,"Oooh.
"
5,5,Terrance & Phillip,"Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
"
5,5,Narrator,"The Canadian act confused American audiences.  But then something happened that would change Terrance and Phillip's act forever.  It was the birth of Canadian comedy.  Terrance and Phillip spent the next several years perfecting their art, and meeting some of America's most influential people. 
"
5,5,Phillip,"Excuse me, which way is the bus station? 
"
5,5,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, you're the guy on the screen. 
"
5,5,Phillip,"What? 
"
5,5,Narrator,"But it was in 1974, on the Sonny & Cher Show, that Terrance and Phillip finally started to mix their Canadian humor with deep political insight. 
"
5,5,Sonny,"You know, Cher, a lot of us real Americans don't know much about Canada.
"
5,5,Cher,"Well, a lot of us real Americans aren't as stupid and short as you, hm. 
"
5,5,Sonny,"Please put your groovy hands together for the young and talented Terrance and Phillip! 
"
5,5,Phillip,"Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Here's a missile for ya! 
"
5,5,Phillip,"That's better. 
"
5,5,Narrator,"With this bold mix of humor and political insight, the world couldn't get enough of Terrance and Phillip.  But their fame would come at a price, when Behind the Blow continues.
"
5,5,Stan,"Okay. Okay, I think we lost them.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
"
5,5,Cartman,"Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
"
5,5,Kyle,"I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
"
5,5,Stan,"Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.
"
5,5,Carl,"There they are! 
"
5,5,Kyle,"Haaah! 
"
5,5,Kenny,"(Aahhh!)
"
5,5,Stan,"Go! Run run run! 
"
5,5,Narrator,"As they entered their late teens, Terrance and Phillip were already starting to taste the sweet milk of success.  But the price of fame was looming, as Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues.  The '70s and '80s were a good time for young Terrance and Phillip.  Their act on the Donny and Marie Show earned them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were on the cover of every magazine.  And then in 1998, even a Saturday morning cartoon was made, based on Terrance and Phillip.  Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices.
"
5,5,Phillip,"Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?
"
5,5,Terrance,"I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas.
"
5,5,Phillip,"Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said? 
"
5,5,Goat leader,"As leader of the goat people, I have seen my species nearly wiped out by your dangerous gas.
"
5,5,Phillip,"Wow, that sucks. 
"
5,5,Narrator,"The cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether Terrance and Phillip were animated characters or real people. And so, in 1998,  the comedy team started work on what they thought would be their greatest achievement: A made-for-TV movie written by and starring Terrance and Phillip, called ""Not Without My Anus.""  It was their biggest project to date. But it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more popular show, the John Schneider Variety Hour , was supposed to air. When fans tuned in to see John Schneider and instead were treated to the Canadian made-for-TV movie , they were enraged, bewildered, and scared.  The fans revolted and burned down the network, killing six television producers and wounding twelve others.  The hatred of Terrance and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wood polish.  Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old fan and was sued for six million dollars. It was the first time the duo tasted failure , and it nearly killed them both.
"
5,5,Terrance,"What's going on here? 
"
5,5,Mr. Mackey,"Sh. We're watching ""Behind the Blow,"" m'kay.
"
5,5,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, hurry up!
"
5,5,Narrator,"After years of depression and suicide attempts, Terrance and Phillip finally decided to get together  for one last film:  the 1999 hit, Asses of Fire. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the summer.  And though the film also started the Canadian-American War of 1999 , in which eight million people lost their lives, the film was considered a great success.  After almost being executed by the American government , Terrance and Phillip were eventually returned to Canada , where they were touted as heroes.  They have been to hell and back, through the very best and the very worst of times, together, but they had seen it through.  And so ends Terrance and Phillip, Behind the Blow. 
"
5,5,Phillip,"Terrance...
"
5,5,Terrance,"Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too.
"
5,5,Phillip,"I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before.
"
5,5,Terrance,"Me neither.
"
5,5,Phillip,"We sssure did go through a lot together.
"
5,5,Terrance,"We sure did.
"
5,5,Phillip,"Terrance, I-
"
5,5,Terrance,"No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault.
"
5,5,Phillip,"That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.  But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did. 
"
5,5,Terrance,"No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone. 
"
5,5,Jack,"Think of all the endangered species that will now vanish because of you! Carl! 
"
5,5,Kenny,"(AH how!) 
"
5,5,Jack,"So long, boys! 
"
5,5,Kyle,"Wait! dude, LOOK! 
"
5,5,Terrance,"Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you.
"
5,5,Phillip,"That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks 
"
5,5,Terrance,"Ohohoho, nohoho! 
"
5,5,Stan,"They're back!
"
5,5,Cartman,"Alright!
"
5,5,Jack,"Yes! Earth Day is saved, boys! Everything worked out after all!
"
5,5,Stan,"It sure did.
"
5,5,Cartman,"Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!
"
5,5,Kenny,"(Oh, well now that's sweet.)
"
5,5,Phillip,"Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted? 
"
5,5,Terrance,"He sure did, Phillip.
"
5,5,Phillip,"NO, I'm asking you his name!
"
5,5,Narrator,"And so, Terrance and Phillip got back together, proving once and for all that fame and fortune are never as important as friendship.
"
5,6,Priest,"...And so it is with heavy hearts that we say good-bye to Mabel Louise Cartman.  She was a good woman, a community leader, a caring wife, a providing mother , and a loving grandmother .
"
5,6,Cartman,"Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
"
5,6,Liane,"Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
"
5,6,Priest,"And now, let us bow our heads in a moment of silence and reflect on how Mabel touched our lives. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"God! She didn't take this long to die.
"
5,6,Priest,"And now we release the doves to symbolize the Lord taking Mabel into his arms and giving her everlasting peace. 
"
5,6,Assistant,"Peace. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"Great. Now can we go?
"
5,6,Liane,"No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Ogh! God-damnit..!
"
5,6,Executor,"...""And so I leave my stocks and bonds, worth an estimate fourteen dollars and twelve cents, to be divided amongst my loving family.""
"
5,6,Cartman,"Mom, I wanna go home!
"
5,6,Liane,"In a minute, sweetie. This is important.
"
5,6,Executor,"""To my loving son, Stinky: I leave you the house in Nebraska. Look after it as your father and I did.""
"
5,6,Cartman,"Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...
"
5,6,Executor,"""To my grandson Eric: You are always my favorite fat little man, my perfect round little pudding-piler.""
"
5,6,Cartman,"Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!
"
5,6,Executor,"""For you, Eric, I leave from my life savings, the sum of one million dollars, to be transferred to you immediately.""
"
5,6,Cartman,"Hoosajiggawha?
"
5,6,Liane,"A million dollars?
"
5,6,Executor,"""Eric is the primary benefactor of my estate, since it is likely the rest of you would spend the money on crack.""
"
5,6,Liane,"Oh my.
"
5,6,Uncle Stinky,"That can't be!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
"
5,6,Executor,"Yes, Eric, it's yours.
"
5,6,Cartman,"No, no, wait, you don't understand.  since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...
"
5,6,Executor,"And now, you do.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Egh... 
"
5,6,Stan,"""There you are, Jennifer Lopez!""  ""You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez.""
"
5,6,Kyle,"""No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!""
"
5,6,Stan,"""It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez."" 
"
5,6,Kyle,"""Have mercy!""  Yeah ha ha!
"
5,6,Stan,"Yeah, awesome!
"
5,6,Stan,"Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
"
5,6,Stan,"...Why?
"
5,6,Kenny,"(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)
"
5,6,Kyle,"Nuh uh.
"
5,6,Kenny,"(No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)
"
5,6,Stan,"You'd better not be lying, Kenny. 
"
5,6,Banker,"Nine hundred ninety nine thousand four hundred, nine hundred ninety nine thousand five hundred...
"
5,6,Jimbo,"Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash.
"
5,6,Ned,"Mm-me neither.
"
5,6,Banker,"...Nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred, one million. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.
"
5,6,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?
"
5,6,Cartman,"I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
"
5,6,Jimbo,"On what?
"
5,6,Cartman,"On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
"
5,6,Broker,"Excuse me son, I'm an investment broker; I can help you invest that money.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.
"
5,6,Priest Maxi,"Eric, God could sure use that money for a bigger church.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
"
5,6,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank. 
"
5,6,Stan,"Oh my God.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Kenny wasn't lying.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
"
5,6,Stan,"Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
"
5,6,Cartman,"HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
"
5,6,Kyle,"Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
"
5,6,Kyle,"No... No, this isn't possible.
"
5,6,Stan,"Yeah, it's unbelievable.
"
5,6,Kyle,"No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
"
5,6,Stan,"Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. 
"
5,6,Kyle,"Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
"
5,6,Broker,"...Aaand if we can just get you to sign here...  and here... .
"
5,6,Liane,"Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?
"
5,6,Cartman,"My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.
"
5,6,Broker,"And now you just sign here, Mr. Fun. 
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"I can't do it.
"
5,6,Broker,"What?
"
5,6,Cartman,"What?!
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"Uh uh I can't sell this poor kid my park.  Look, I haven't been honest with you. The park hasn't been doing great business.
"
5,6,Broker,"Frank...
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"Sshhhh. It ain't right, Chris.  The truth is, the park is a financial flop. I haven't turned a profit in years because I can't keep attendance up.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"You... you're not?
"
5,6,Cartman,"No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"Nn-oh. Well then, I guess I don't feel bad. 
"
5,6,Chris,"Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"Gentlemen, I thank you.
"
5,6,Stan,"Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?
"
5,6,Kyle,"Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.
"
5,6,Stan,"Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
"
5,6,Kyle,"Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. 
"
5,6,Stan,"Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how much fun I had!  Whoa! Heheheheh.  Ah! Heheh.  Whoa! Heh, heheh.  Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome!  Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess!  Yehess!  I'm so happy! I'm so happy..!
"
5,6,Stan,"Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Great. 
"
5,6,Stan,"What's that?
"
5,6,Kyle,"It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.
"
5,6,Stan,"Heh, heh.  Sorry.
"
5,6,Kyle,"So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
"
5,6,Stan,"Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Hunh, I guess you're right.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember:  So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.
"
5,6,Stan,"That does it, dude!
"
5,6,Kyle,"Where are we going?
"
5,6,Stan,"We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! 
"
5,6,Cartman,"Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
"
5,6,Cartman,"What the hell?
"
5,6,Kyle,"Hohohooho! Oowwww!
"
5,6,Cartman,"You sons of bitches! 
"
5,6,Stan,"Come on, dude!
"
5,6,Kyle,"Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
"
5,6,Cartman,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
5,6,Stan,"Aw, crap.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Oh God, get me off of here!! 
"
5,6,Stan,"Dude! 
"
5,6,Kyle,"Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
"
5,6,Stan,"Alright, let's go.
"
5,6,Cartman,"That's right! You stay out!
"
5,6,Stan,"You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
"
5,6,Kyle,"My life can't get any worse!
"
5,6,Stan,"You'll see! We'll get in! 
"
5,6,Cartman,"...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!
"
5,6,Security Guard,"So what does does this job pay?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.
"
5,6,Security Guard,"Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides.
"
5,6,Cartman,"But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.
"
5,6,Security Guard,"I'm not interested.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.
"
5,6,Security Guard,"If you need security, I need a cash salary.
"
5,6,Cartman,"But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
"
5,6,Security Guard,"Well, look: Why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? Every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use that to pay my daily salary.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Ugh... Two people?
"
5,6,Security Guard,"This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...
"
5,6,Security Guard,"I will shoot on sight.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
5,6,Doctor,"You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you. 
"
5,6,Kyle,"Lucky. 
"
5,6,Gerald,"Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you.
"
5,6,Stan,"Dude, are you okay?
"
5,6,Kyle,"Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
"
5,6,Stan,"Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.
"
5,6,Sheila,"Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.
"
5,6,Stan,"Jesus.
"
5,6,Kyle,"But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
"
5,6,Sheila,"Kyle, don't say such things!
"
5,6,Kyle,"Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
"
5,6,Gerald,"Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--
"
5,6,Kyle,"No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. 
"
5,6,Kids,"Aw.
"
5,6,Boy,"That's gay.
"
5,6,Cartman,"I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
"
5,6,Butters,"Hoh.
"
5,6,Clyde,"Oh. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"The rest of you will just have to try another day.
"
5,6,Kids,"Aw. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.
"
5,6,Butters,"Hoh boy, oh boy! 
"
5,6,Cartman,"...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?
"
5,6,Butters,"We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? 
"
5,6,Butters,"Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. 
"
5,6,Clyde,"Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Ugh, alright, alright, hang on.  Security!
"
5,6,Security Guard,"What?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.
"
5,6,Security Guard,"Uh, I'm security, not maintenance.
"
5,6,Cartman,"But I don't know how it works.
"
5,6,Security Guard,"Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go. 
"
5,6,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Wait a minute! Who are you?
"
5,6,Boy,"Mike Gainor. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!
"
5,6,Stan,"Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!
"
5,6,Cartman,"I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
"
5,6,Stan,"It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Get him out of here! 
"
5,6,Security Guard,"Move along, sir. 
"
5,6,Stan,"AGGH!  This isn't over, Cartman!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....
"
5,6,Kyle,"Agh!  Agghh! 
"
5,6,Nurse,"Just a little more.  There we go. 
"
5,6,Gerald,"Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?
"
5,6,Kyle,"Awesome. 
"
5,6,Sheila,"Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.
"
5,6,Kyle,"I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
"
5,6,Gerald,"Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay.  You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago.  Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children , a wonderful wife, and many friends. 
"
5,6,Sheila,"He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor. 
"
5,6,Gerald,"He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God. 
"
5,6,Sheila,"But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Satan talked to God?
"
5,6,Sheila,"Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, ""Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day.""
"
5,6,Gerald,"But Satan said, ""Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name.""
"
5,6,Sheila,"To which God said, ""Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name.""
"
5,6,Gerald,"And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers. 
"
5,6,Sheila,"Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. 
"
5,6,Gerald,"And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all. 
"
5,6,Sheila,"Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, ""The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away,"" and praised God's name. 
"
5,6,Gerald,"So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. 
"
5,6,Sheila,"He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith. 
"
5,6,Gerald,"God said to Satan, ""See? I told you. Job still praises me."" 
"
5,6,Kyle,"And that's it? That's the end?
"
5,6,Sheila,"Basically.
"
5,6,Kyle,"That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
"
5,6,Gerald,"Oh. Uhhh, I don't know.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
"
5,6,Cartman,"...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! 
"
5,6,Clerk,"Welcome to Cartmanland.
"
5,6,Sheila,"Isn't he getting any better, doctor?
"
5,6,Doctor,"I don't understand it. He's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's like he... like he's lost all hope. Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more tests to run. 
"
5,6,Announcer,"And now back to Money Quest, on HBC.
"
5,6,Host 1,"Welcome back to Money Quest.  In just over two weeks, young financial genius Eric Cartman  has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands.
"
5,6,Host 2,"And the way he did it is with the brilliant ""You Can't Come"" technique. For the first several days, the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park. It made the public crazy. So then, weeks later, when he opened the doors, they were lining up around the block. Simply amazing.
"
5,6,Host 1,"Well, ahah I think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country.
"
5,6,Waitress,"I'm sorry, we're no longer taking reservations. Nobody can eat here. You'll have to leave now.
"
5,6,Clerk,"No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in.
"
5,6,Associate,"Out! Nobody is allowed into Gracy's anymore! Get out of here! 
"
5,6,Host 1,"Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... 
"
5,6,Sheila,"Kyle? Kyle?  Get the doctor!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me! 
"
5,6,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)  (Heeheehee!!) 
"
5,6,Cartman,"AGH!  DAAGGHHHH!!
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around!
"
5,6,Chris,"He sure did!
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like this!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Hey, there you are! 
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Just give me my money back.
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"What?
"
5,6,Cartman,"I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"...But it's doing great!
"
5,6,Cartman,"You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"You bet! I'll go get your money right now. 
"
5,6,Boy,"Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?
"
5,6,Cartman,"GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
"
5,6,Cartman,"GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
"
5,6,Gerald,"Isn't he responding at all, doctor?
"
5,6,Doctor,"I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he's... he's just... given up on life.
"
5,6,Sheila,"But then... are you saying...?
"
5,6,Doctor,"There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live.
"
5,6,Sheila,"Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! 
"
5,6,Agent,"Excuse me? Eric Cartman?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Yeah?
"
5,6,Agent,"I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy.  Seize the assets. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"He-hey, that's my money!
"
5,6,Mr. Garrett,"There's also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. The family's entitled to the rest of this. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
"
5,6,Mr. Garrett,"You still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, Mr. Cartman. We'll see you in court. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!
"
5,6,Mr. Garrett,"We know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.
"
5,6,Cartman,"No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"Nohoho way, José!
"
5,6,Cartman,"But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!
"
5,6,Mr. Fun,"""I don't care,"" said Pierre. ""I'm from France."" 
"
5,6,Cartman,"This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
"
5,6,Stan,"Kyle, you gotta see!! 
"
5,6,Sheila,"Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald! 
"
5,6,Stan,"Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?
"
5,6,Doctor,"Well, I s-supposed it could be rigged, but I--
"
5,6,Stan,"Then damnit man, do it!
"
5,6,Cartman,"It isn't fair!  You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! 
"
5,6,Stan,"Look, Kyle. Look. 
"
5,6,Kyle,"Huh?
"
5,6,Cartman,"You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! 
"
5,6,Kyle,"Huh?
"
5,6,Cartman,"I'M SO PISSED OFF! 
"
5,6,Security Guard,"Move along, sir! You are vandalizing private property!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! 
"
5,6,Stan,"Kyle!
"
5,6,Doctor,"He's coming back.
"
5,6,Sheila,"That's it, baby. That's it.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!
"
5,6,Doctor,"Wait a minute. Yes! The hemorrhoid is going into remission!
"
5,6,Hemorrhoid,"Oh, shit!
"
5,6,Stan,"Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
"
5,6,Cartman,"It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! 
"
5,6,Kyle,"You are up there! 
"
5,7,Stan,"""So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!""
"
5,7,Kyle,"""No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies.""
"
5,7,Stan,"""That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures"" 
"
5,7,Kyle,"""Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!""
"
5,7,Stan,"""Scream for me, bitch!""
"
5,7,Kyle,"""AAAAAAAH!"" 
"
5,7,"Stan, Kyle","Whoa! Awesome!
"
5,7,Cartman,"Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!
"
5,7,Stan,"Oh no, what now?
"
5,7,Cartman,"No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! 
"
5,7,Kyle,"What's this all about, Kenny?
"
5,7,Kenny,"(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
"
5,7,Cartman,"Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.  Come on. 
"
5,7,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
5,7,Cartman,"I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
"
5,7,Kyle,"No they don't!
"
5,7,Kenny,"(Yeah they do!)
"
5,7,Cartman,"Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh!
"
5,7,Stan,"Whoa, cool! 
"
5,7,Kyle,"That's awesome!
"
5,7,Cartman,"I told you guys.
"
5,7,Stan,"I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
"
5,7,Cartman,"Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.
"
5,7,Kyle,"You ""beat off?""
"
5,7,Cartman,"That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything?
"
5,7,Stan,"Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
"
5,7,Cartman,"Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! 
"
5,7,Sharon,"I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-
"
5,7,Stan,"Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!
"
5,7,Sharon,"Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?
"
5,7,Stan,"But it's super-cool!
"
5,7,Sharon,"Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.
"
5,7,Man,"Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry.
"
5,7,Sharon,"Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: 
"
5,7,Stan,"Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.
"
5,7,Sharon,"""Cannery Row in Monterey in California-""  ""-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise...""  It's amazing how with three images  he puts you right there, and...
"
5,7,Stan,"Red rocket, red rocket!
"
5,7,Randy,"WAAAH!
"
5,7,Sharon,"Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!
"
5,7,Stan,"I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. 
"
5,7,Sharon,"STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!
"
5,7,Stan,"My room? Why?
"
5,7,Sharon,"Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades.
"
5,7,Sharon,"Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?
"
5,7,Stan,"No!
"
5,7,Randy,"Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!
"
5,7,Stan,"Why?! What's the big deal?!
"
5,7,Sharon,"Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??
"
5,7,Stan,"I was doing ""red rocket"" to make the dog's milk come out.
"
5,7,Randy,"No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.
"
5,7,Stan,"Huh??
"
5,7,Sharon,"You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!
"
5,7,Randy,"Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!
"
5,7,Stan,"What things??
"
5,7,Sharon,"Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet?
"
5,7,Stan,"No!
"
5,7,Sharon,"Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!
"
5,7,Randy,"Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! 
"
5,7,Principal Victoria,"Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time.
"
5,7,Sharon,"Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age.
"
5,7,Principal Victoria,"School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.
"
5,7,Mr. Tweek,"It isn't soon enough.
"
5,7,Stuart,"Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog. 
"
5,7,Chef,"Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex.
"
5,7,Chef,"The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.
"
5,7,Sheila,"No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education.  From the school.
"
5,7,Adults,"Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like ""penis"" and ""vagina.""  Nuh- now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay.  Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum.  STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral!  M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh...  let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm.
"
5,7,Stan,"Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh...  I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh, what the hell did I do with that damned thing??
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it.
"
5,7,Wendy,"Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited.
"
5,7,Bebe,"Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!
"
5,7,Girls,"Yeah!
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we?  SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES!!  That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?
"
5,7,Wendy,"I didn't mean that-
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, ""It's not going to happen to me."" You say, ""Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado."" WRONG!  Gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, HPV, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences!  You think that sex is about fun and games and love?  Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes.
"
5,7,Girls,"AAAHHH!
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"And here's a little syphilis for you!
"
5,7,Girls,"AAAHHH!
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms!
"
5,7,Chef,"Hello there, children.
"
5,7,Boys,"Hey Chef.
"
5,7,Chef,"How is sexual education class going?
"
5,7,Stan,"It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
"
5,7,Chef,"Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""?
"
5,7,Chef,"...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
"
5,7,Stan,"Yeah.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get-
"
5,7,Girls,"AAAAHHH! 
"
5,7,Kyle,"What the hell is wrong with them? 
"
5,7,Stan,"You guys, we just wanna know if you-
"
5,7,Girls,"AAAAHHH!
"
5,7,Wendy,"Stay away from me, Stan!
"
5,7,Stan,"Why?
"
5,7,Wendy,"Are you wearing a condom?
"
5,7,Stan,"...A what?
"
5,7,Girls,"AAAAHHH!
"
5,7,Bebe,"Do any of you have your condoms on?
"
5,7,Kyle,"No.
"
5,7,Girls,"AAAAHHH!
"
5,7,Wendy,"Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
"
5,7,Kyle,"Nuh uh.
"
5,7,Bebe,"Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS.
"
5,7,Cartman,"AIDS?
"
5,7,Butters,"Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Is that what you learned in sex ed?
"
5,7,Cartman,"Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
"
5,7,Stan,"Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.
"
5,7,Wendy,"You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.
"
5,7,Stan,"But Wendy, we don't understand how that-
"
5,7,Girls,"AAAAHHH! 
"
5,7,Kyle,"Oh my God, dude.
"
5,7,Butters,"Uh what are we gonna do, huh?
"
5,7,Stan,"Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.
"
5,7,Boys,"Yeah. 
"
5,7,Pharmacist,"Can I help you boys?
"
5,7,Stan,"Yeah, we need condoms!
"
5,7,Pharmacist,"Condoms?
"
5,7,Kyle,"Yeah. Quick!
"
5,7,Pharmacist,"How old are you boys?
"
5,7,Stan,"Why does that matter?
"
5,7,Butters,"Ha-I'll be nine next week.
"
5,7,Pharmacist,"Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
"
5,7,Pharmacist,"I just don't think kids your age should be-
"
5,7,Assistant,"Mark, we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them.
"
5,7,Mark,"But... they're... children!
"
5,7,Assistant,"Would you rather them do it unprotected?
"
5,7,Cartman,"Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!
"
5,7,Mark,"I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!
"
5,7,Assistant,"Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected.
"
5,7,Stan,"Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.
"
5,7,Mark,"I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!
"
5,7,Assistant,"Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty.
"
5,7,Butters,"Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?
"
5,7,Assistant,"No, you have to change it.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... ""missed"" anything.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Right! Oral sex, which of course would be...
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Using your mouth on the penis or vagina.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, why d-uh, did you?
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Did I what?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin.  But I'm not ashamed of it! I wasn't sought after much in high school or college.  I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses.  The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Super Bowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh,  anyhow  And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college. 
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Your nickname?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"""That guy with the really big head.""
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"...Right.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Neither have I.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Uh not me!  Huhuh, okay.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Well, back to the lesson plan, then.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Right. 
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Okay.  ""Oral Sex""
"
5,7,Stan,"Doesn't it give any other directions?
"
5,7,Butters,"Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  ""If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes""
"
5,7,Kyle,"Uh, what are ""studzes""
"
5,7,Butters,"How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.
"
5,7,Cartman,"Just put it on, Butters.
"
5,7,Butters,"Ha-a how come I gotta go first?
"
5,7,Cartman,"Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?
"
5,7,Butters,"Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky.
"
5,7,Kyle,"It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
"
5,7,Butters,"I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. 
"
5,7,Stan,"Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!
"
5,7,Cartman,"I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
"
5,7,Kyle,"Sure.
"
5,7,Butters,"But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
"
5,7,Tweek,"Ah, I got rubber bands. 
"
5,7,Butters,"Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.
"
5,7,Stan,"How do you feel?
"
5,7,Butters,"...Pretty good.
"
5,7,Cartman,"Do you feel protected?
"
5,7,Butters,"Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
"
5,7,Stan,"Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.
"
5,7,Timmy,"Timmehah!
"
5,7,Principal Victoria,"Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade.
"
5,7,Principal Victoria,"But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"...Kindergarten.
"
5,7,Chef,"Kindergarten?!
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after.
"
5,7,Chef,"Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!
"
5,7,Mr. Adler,"I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.
"
5,7,Principal Victoria,"I guess we have no choice.
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is?  Yes, Jenny?
"
5,7,Jenny,"It flies around and it's endangered.
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor.  Con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of STDs.  Yes, Filmore?
"
5,7,Filmore,"Can we do fingerpaint?
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom.  First of all you remove the condom from its package.  Then you find which way the condom rolls out.  Put it in your mouth...  And apply.  And it's as simple as that. Any questions?
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all.  PREGNANCY!  That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?! 
"
5,7,Narrator,"Snacky S'mores presents: The Miracle of Child Birth.  The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking.
"
5,7,Girls,"Eeeeww. 
"
5,7,Narrator,"Later, the contractions are happening closer together. Mom sure is in a lot of pain. Now we can see the crown of the baby's head, stretching the vaginal walls in ways never before thought possible by Mom. Finally, the miracle happens, and the baby is born.  but Mom's not done yet.
"
5,7,Girl,"Eeww.
"
5,7,Narrator,"She still got some afterbirth to push out of her. 
"
5,7,Girls,"AAAAAAAA!!!! 
"
5,7,Narrator,"That's right.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Girls! Girls! Where are you going?! 
"
5,7,Stan,"Man, this condom's driving me crazy.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
"
5,7,Cartman,"Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. 
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay.  M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening.  This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing?
"
5,7,Cartman,"I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Why are you wearing a condom?
"
5,7,Cartman,"So I don't get AIDS.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex.
"
5,7,Stan,"From sex??
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Yes.
"
5,7,Kyle,"You mean, intercourse with a girl?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye.
"
5,7,Stan,"All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
"
5,7,Cartman,"I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
"
5,7,Kyle,"Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
"
5,7,Stan,"Yeah, come on guys, this is war! 
"
5,7,Boys,"Yeah! That's right! Come on!  
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m'kay.
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?
"
5,7,Filmore,"Miss'nary position?
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?
"
5,7,Girl,"Doggie?
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"That's right. Doggie style we went over, mhm.
"
5,7,Boy,"Pile driver?
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Uh huh, pile driver position. Good, Quaid.
"
5,7,Sally,"The Filthy Sanchez?
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez.
"
5,7,Boy 2,"Hot Karl?
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure.
"
5,7,Clyde,"There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. 
"
5,7,Wendy,"Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!
"
5,7,Bebe,"Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!
"
5,7,Stan,"Ha! They're your diseases!
"
5,7,Kyle,"Yeah! You get out of town!
"
5,7,Cartman,"Here, talk to them, Butters.
"
5,7,Butters,"Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?
"
5,7,Cartman,"Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
"
5,7,Butters,"Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Man, he's pretty good.
"
5,7,Bebe,"We'll never walk away. Never! 
"
5,7,Kenny,"(Waa-ooo!) 
"
5,7,Cartman,"Oh, bitch!
"
5,7,Stan,"That does it! Attack! 
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"I've already gone through that with the girls.  It's pretty simple. Do you wanna drink?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Why, sure.  Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm...  Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse. 
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Or the... shaft... of the penis? 
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the...  clitoris of the woman.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"And these... are the two areas most important to-
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Sexual stimulation.  Oh, is this wrong?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong.  I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"I go crazy.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Do you touch yourself?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah. Hmm. 
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Haawww. Haawww.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"G'oh, m'kay.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Huh, what's wrong?
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"It's your turn. 
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. Okay! Okay!
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Do you want me?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"I do.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Tell me.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"I want you. M'kay. 
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well. No.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Oh well, fuck it  Oh God, give it to me! 
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Oh yeah. Woh. 
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Woh.  Ooh, that's it baby! That's it!
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Aw, this feels so good, m'kay. 
"
5,7,Boys,"WAAAAHHH!! 
"
5,7,Girls,"Waaaahh!! 
"
5,7,Sharon,"What the hell was that?
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"Did you feel something?
"
5,7,Chef,"Oh, no!
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Jesus Christ. 
"
5,7,Cartman,"Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.
"
5,7,Sharon,"Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves. 
"
5,7,Stan,"We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first.
"
5,7,Kids,"Oooohhh.
"
5,7,Chef,"Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved.
"
5,7,Parents,"Huh?
"
5,7,Chef,"Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know,  someone who has a bad opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert. 
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is that s'posed to mean?
"
5,7,Ms. Choksondik,"He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently.
"
5,7,Sharon,"This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.
"
5,7,Sheila,"It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject.
"
5,7,Principal Victoria,"Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.
"
5,7,Kids,"Hooray!
"
5,7,Stan,"But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?
"
5,7,Chef,"It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Seventeen? 
"
5,7,Chef,"Seventeen.
"
5,7,Sheila,"So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?
"
5,7,Chef,"Nope, just 17.
"
5,7,Gerald,"But, what if you're not ready at 17?
"
5,7,Chef,"Seventeen! You're ready. 
"
5,7,Stan,"Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
"
5,7,Wendy,"Yeah. Thank God.
"
5,7,Cartman,"Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, so what other sexual positions have we talked about? Yeah, the wrap-around butt grab. Sure, can't forget that. Uh huh, reverse cowgirl. Good, Kevin. Hot Lunch, sure, she likes that. Donkey Punch, uh huh. Glass-bottom boat. Good one, yes. Fish-eye. Good, Jenny. Chili dog. Mm-hm.
"
5,8,Kyle,"HA! I killed you!
"
5,8,Stan,"HA, I blew your head off!
"
5,8,Kenny,"(Aw, Goddamnit!)
"
5,8,Stan,"Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
"
5,8,Cartman,"Let a man take a crap!
"
5,8,Stan,"Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Hyeah, that poor, poor thing
"
5,8,Stan,"Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!
"
5,8,Cartman,"I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
"
5,8,Cartman,"Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.
"
5,8,Sharon,"Are you guys still playing that video game?
"
5,8,Stan,"Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. 
"
5,8,Sharon,"Eric, put that down!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Why?
"
5,8,Sharon,"Just go put it back in the trashcan!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.
"
5,8,Sharon,"No that... that came from me; just put it away.
"
5,8,Cartman,"This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
"
5,8,Stan,"What is it, Mom?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?
"
5,8,Sharon,"Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting.
"
5,8,Stan,"The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
"
5,8,Sharon,"Sure.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Cool!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
"
5,8,Stan,"There it is. The Okama GameSphere. 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
"
5,8,Stan,"What's that?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. 
"
5,8,Stan,"Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!
"
5,8,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
5,8,Kyle,"Awesome!  Oh, crap.
"
5,8,Stan,"What?
"
5,8,Kyle,"I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
"
5,8,Stan,"Dude, we got GameSphere.
"
5,8,Kyle,"I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 
"
5,8,Towelie,"Don't forget to bring a towel. 
"
5,8,Stan,"What?
"
5,8,Towelie,"When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, ""Don't forget to bring a towel.""
"
5,8,Stan,"...O-kay.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Thanks, Towelie.
"
5,8,Towelie,"Do you wanna get high?
"
5,8,Stan,"No. 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.
"
5,8,Sharon,"Here you go, boys. 
"
5,8,Boys,"AAAAAA.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Okay, turn it on.
"
5,8,TV,"""Okama GameSphere""!
"
5,8,Boys,"Whoa!
"
5,8,TV,"Thirst For BLOOD!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Oh, this is so cool.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Bring it, bring it! 
"
5,8,Sharon,"Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late.
"
5,8,Stan,"G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.
"
5,8,Randy,"What?
"
5,8,Sharon,"Nothing. Come on, Randy. 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?
"
5,8,Cartman,"Date-rape psychosis.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Awesome!
"
5,8,Kyle,"She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
"
5,8,Stan,"Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
"
5,8,Cartman,"We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
"
5,8,Stan,"Well, it's alright. We can still play for  six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.
"
5,8,Towelie,"Don't forget to bring a towel.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Uh no.
"
5,8,Towelie,"When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, ""Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag.""
"
5,8,Stan,"Okay, we will.
"
5,8,Towelie,"Alright!  Do you wanna get high?
"
5,8,Kyle,"No we don't wanna get high!
"
5,8,Towelie,"Okay... You sure?
"
5,8,Cartman,"Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
"
5,8,Cartman,"That's... so... cool!
"
5,8,Sharon,"Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.
"
5,8,Stan,"No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
"
5,8,Sharon,"No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.
"
5,8,Cartman,"It's Monday?
"
5,8,Stan,"Oh, uh, I'm sick.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Me too.
"
5,8,Sharon,"No, you're not sick. Now get to school.  All of you.
"
5,8,Stan,"But Mom...
"
5,8,Sharon,"Go!
"
5,8,Boys,"Aagh!
"
5,8,Stan,"Can't believe we have to go to school!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
"
5,8,Stan,"We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. 
"
5,8,Commander,"Hello, boys, how are you?
"
5,8,Stan,"Fine.
"
5,8,Commander,"Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere.
"
5,8,Kyle,"What? You mean Towelie? 
"
5,8,Commander,"Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at...  Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado! 
"
5,8,Cartman,"What, dude? 
"
5,8,Stan,"This is gonna be one looong-ass day. 
"
5,8,Stan,"That was the longest day of school ever!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Where is it?
"
5,8,Stan,"It... it was right here.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Where the hell is it??
"
5,8,Cartman,"Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need my fix! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Hello?
"
5,8,Voice,"If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere again, you will bring us the towel. 
"
5,8,Stan,"What? Who-who is this?
"
5,8,Voice,"Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Don't hurt it! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"What? 
"
5,8,Stan,"They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
"
5,8,Cartman,"No! ...No!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
"
5,8,Stan,"Towelie!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Hey, towel!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Where the hell is he?
"
5,8,Kenny,"(I don't know. Where could it be?)
"
5,8,Stan,"I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
"
5,8,Kyle,"What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.  Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!
"
5,8,Kyle,"That's a towel call?
"
5,8,Stan,"This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
"
5,8,Stan,"Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!
"
5,8,Towelie,"Don't forget to bring a towel.
"
5,8,Kyle,"There he is!
"
5,8,Towelie,"Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. .
"
5,8,Stan,"Come on, dude! 
"
5,8,Towelie,"Where are we goin'?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Just come on! It's getting dark.
"
5,8,Towelie,"Are we gonna get high?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Are you sure this is where they said to be?
"
5,8,Stan,"They said the gas station outside of town.
"
5,8,Towelie,"Well, I'm gonna get a little high. 
"
5,8,Man,"Hold it! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Who is that? 
"
5,8,Man,"Step... away... from the towel! 
"
5,8,Official,"There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you.
"
5,8,Towelie,"If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.
"
5,8,Official,"It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you.
"
5,8,Stan,"'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
"
5,8,Official,"Your what?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
"
5,8,Official,"I don't know what you're talking about.
"
5,8,Stan,"You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
"
5,8,Official,"Omigod!  IT""S A TRAP!! 
"
5,8,Man 2,"Cover! Cover! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Goddamnit, what now?!
"
5,8,Official,"Run, towel! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. 
"
5,8,Soldier 1,"Where's the towel?!
"
5,8,Soldier 2,"It can't be far!  Alvarez, you and Mitchell sweep left!
"
5,8,Guard,"Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp!
"
5,8,Stan,"Where is our Okama GameSphere?
"
5,8,Guard,"Get the towel home  They will explain everything. Please, hurry! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Aw, God-damnit!
"
5,8,Stan,"Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?
"
5,8,Towelie,"What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.
"
5,8,Stan,"Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. 
"
5,8,Commander,"Well?
"
5,8,Soldier,"They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air.
"
5,8,Commander,"Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel.  They must have some unexplainable bond with it.
"
5,8,Soldier 2,"Perhaps they're telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T. 
"
5,8,Commander,"It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B.
"
5,8,Soldier 3,"You mean...?
"
5,8,Commander,"Yes.  Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius. 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Are we getting close?
"
5,8,Towelie,"I think so.
"
5,8,Stan,"A little more gas, Kenny. 
"
5,8,Kyle,"How long has it been since you've been back there.
"
5,8,Towelie,"I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.
"
5,8,Cartman,"No it isn't.
"
5,8,Towelie,"Is!
"
5,8,Cartman,"No it isn't.
"
5,8,Towelie,"Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.
"
5,8,Stan,"Brake, Kenny, brake. 
"
5,8,Cartman,"Egh!
"
5,8,Towelie,"M-maybe it's down that dirt road.
"
5,8,Stan,"Dude, don't you remember where it is?
"
5,8,Towelie,"I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high.  then I'll remember where it is. 
"
5,8,Stan,"Alright, so where is it?
"
5,8,Towelie,"Where's what?
"
5,8,Boys,"Agh!
"
5,8,Kyle,"The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
"
5,8,Towelie,"Well calm down.
"
5,8,Kyle,"That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
"
5,8,Towelie,"That's my last joint, asshole!
"
5,8,Kyle,"I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
"
5,8,Towelie,"Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.
"
5,8,Woman,"Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil.  Kevin, is that you?
"
5,8,Soldier,"Harris! Reach bang and clear!
"
5,8,Woman,"Hello?  WAAH!  Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod! 
"
5,8,Soldier,"Alright, it's clear! It's clear! 
"
5,8,Soldiers,"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! 
"
5,8,Soldier,"Let's go let's go! 
"
5,8,Soldier,"Get it!
"
5,8,Mr. Garrison,"What the? 
"
5,8,Soldier,"Throw it down! 
"
5,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! 
"
5,8,Soldier,"Alright, let's go! 
"
5,8,Mr. Garrison,"Huh where are you goin'?
"
5,8,Cartman,"This is where you came from?
"
5,8,Towelie,"Yeah, I think so.  Oh man.
"
5,8,Stan,"What?
"
5,8,Towelie,"I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. 
"
5,8,Research Leader,"Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400.
"
5,8,Stan,"Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
"
5,8,Kyle,"We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
"
5,8,Research Leader,"Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth
"
5,8,Stan,"We don't care.
"
5,8,Research Leader,"You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly.
"
5,8,Stan,"Dude, we don't care.
"
5,8,Research Leader,"Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off.
"
5,8,Stan,"We... don't... care.
"
5,8,Kyle,"All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
"
5,8,Research Leader,"Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Who's they?
"
5,8,Research Leader,"Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction.
"
5,8,Stan,"Don't care, don't care, don't care.
"
5,8,Research Leader,"Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
"
5,8,Research Leader,"I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at ""their"" base.
"
5,8,Stan,"Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please?
"
5,8,Research Leader,"You mean to go right into their base?  Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.
"
5,8,Soldier,"Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!
"
5,8,Commander,"Ah yes.  Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?
"
5,8,Sgt. Masters,"Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.
"
5,8,Commander,"Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this. 
"
5,8,Sgt. Boll,"Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles.
"
5,8,Commander,"Hmm...  So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!
"
5,8,Sgt. Masters,"Oo we...
"
5,8,Sgt. Boll,"He must have outsmarted us, sir.
"
5,8,Commander,"Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!
"
5,8,Research Leader,"In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Okay.
"
5,8,Research Leader,"I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks.
"
5,8,Towelie,"That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
"
5,8,Research Leader,"Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you.
"
5,8,Stan,"We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
"
5,8,Guard,"Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?
"
5,8,Stan,"Yeah. 
"
5,8,Guard,"Go go go go! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Dude, I figured it out.
"
5,8,Stan,"What?
"
5,8,Kyle,"If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
"
5,8,Stan,"So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Seven and a half.
"
5,8,Stan,"Hurry up, stupid parachute!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Alright, I think we go over there. 
"
5,8,Towelie,"Let's see.  No. 
"
5,8,Stan,"Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
"
5,8,Towelie,"Hey it's been a long time!
"
5,8,Cartman,"You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
"
5,8,Towelie,"Don't preach to me, fatso!
"
5,8,Cartman,"I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!
"
5,8,Towelie,"You're stupid!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Yeah, and you're a towel!
"
5,8,Towelie,"You're a towel!  Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.
"
5,8,Stan,"Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter. 
"
5,8,Towelie,"Hold on.  Wait a second  That's it!
"
5,8,Kyle,"That's it?
"
5,8,Towelie,"Yeah. That's the melody to ""Funky Town.""  Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.
"
5,8,Stan,"No, Towelie, the entry code!
"
5,8,Towelie,"For what?
"
5,8,Stan,"God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Well let's look in here. 
"
5,8,Towelie Clone,"Kill... me... Kill... me.
"
5,8,Towelie,"Oh my God! No-o-o-o!
"
5,8,Commander,"Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in.
"
5,8,Towelie,"What are these things?
"
5,8,Commander,"Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid.
"
5,8,Towelie Clone,"Kill... me.
"
5,8,Stan,"Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
"
5,8,Commander,"You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story.
"
5,8,Stan,"Oh God, don't care, don't care.
"
5,8,Commander,"Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret. 
"
5,8,Soldier,"Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.
"
5,8,Kyle,"What terrifying secret?
"
5,8,Commander,"That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
"
5,8,Cartman,"We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
"
5,8,Commander,"Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier.  Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know.
"
5,8,Kyle,"And we don't care.
"
5,8,Commander,"You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down.
"
5,8,Stan,"So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
"
5,8,Commander,"Oh yes. It has been all along.
"
5,8,Soldier,"Can I kill the towel now, sir?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Go ahead. 
"
5,8,Commander,"No, wait.  Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well.  You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all.
"
5,8,Stan,"But we don't care!
"
5,8,Official 1,"What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!
"
5,8,Research Leader,"The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.
"
5,8,Official 2,"We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!
"
5,8,Research Leader,"Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier. 
"
5,8,GS-401,"Don't forget to bring a towel!
"
5,8,Commander,"Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished.  Then upload this encryption disk into their computers.
"
5,8,Stan,"We're just going in to get our video game back.
"
5,8,Commander,"If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle. 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Photon rifle, whatever. 
"
5,8,Stan,"Hello? Hello, anybody here? 
"
5,8,GS-401,"Welcome to the party, boys!  HAAARRRHHHH!! 
"
5,8,Towelie,"Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.
"
5,8,GS-401,"HAAARRRHHHH!! 
"
5,8,Research Leader,"So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?
"
5,8,Commander,"Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move!  Don't make a move, you bastards!
"
5,8,Research Leader,"Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children.
"
5,8,Commander,"Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.
"
5,8,Research Leader,"Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on!
"
5,8,Stan,"Ohmigod, look! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Our GameSphere! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. 
"
5,8,Research Leader,"You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!
"
5,8,Commander,"Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Sweet!
"
5,8,Commander,"But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!
"
5,8,Zytar,"Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.
"
5,8,Commander,"And now you know the horrible truth, boys.
"
5,8,Zytar,"Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over! 
"
5,8,Cartman,"Could you turn it up?
"
5,8,Commander,"Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out!  I think I can get it from here, boys!
"
5,8,Zytar,"What are you doing? You'll kill us all!
"
5,8,Commander,"Sorry, Zytar. Didn't your mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings. 
"
5,8,Boys,"Oooww! 
"
5,8,Cartman,"Hup hup. Come on, hang on. 
"
5,8,"Stan, Kyle","Whoa.
"
5,8,Kenny,"(Help help! Heeelllppp!) 
"
5,8,Cartman,"Kenny!
"
5,8,Kenny,"(Nooo!) 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! 
"
5,8,GS-401,"What are you doing?
"
5,8,Towelie,"Get away from me, you evil towel!
"
5,8,GS-401,"Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them.
"
5,8,Towelie,"No way! They're my friends!
"
5,8,GS-401,"They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now.
"
5,8,Kyle,"I've almost got it!
"
5,8,GS-401,"You're going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness.  Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you've had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!
"
5,8,Stan,"Aw, crap!
"
5,8,GS-401,"You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high.
"
5,8,Towelie,"You asshole.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
"
5,8,GS-401,"Come, Towelie! Make your decision!
"
5,8,Towelie,"I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"I got it! 
"
5,8,GS-401,"Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
"
5,8,"Kyle, Towelie","Alright!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Hooray!
"
5,8,Stan,"Oh, dude, we finished level 50!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Awesome!
"
5,8,Towelie,"Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
"
5,8,Stan,"Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
"
5,8,Towelie,"Don't forget to bring a towel. 
"
5,8,Cartman,"You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
"
5,8,Towelie,"I know.
"
5,9,Kyle,"...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
"
5,9,Cartman,"...Not really.
"
5,9,Butters,"Uh, hey!  How's it goin', fellas?
"
5,9,Stan,"Butters, what the hell are you doing?
"
5,9,Butters,"Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
"
5,9,Kyle,"These are gas masks, Butters!
"
5,9,Stan,"Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
"
5,9,Butters,"What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?
"
5,9,Stan,"There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
"
5,9,Butters,"Stop breathin'?
"
5,9,Kyle,"Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
"
5,9,Butters,"Well. Alright, then. 
"
5,9,Officer Barbrady,"Well okay. Next?  Next?  Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers...  Okay, next?  A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!
"
5,9,Cartman,"Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.
"
5,9,Officer Barbrady,"These are a weapon! 
"
5,9,Cartman,"Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?
"
5,9,Officer Barbrady,"I'll think of a way. Now move along!
"
5,9,Cartman,"God-damnit! 
"
5,9,Officer Barbrady,"Alright, next!  Okay, clear. 
"
5,9,Tweek,"Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me!  Oh Christ!  they might - could get me.
"
5,9,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright class, as some of you may have heard, the President has asked that American children all send one dollar to the children of Afghanistan.  So I have a list of addresses and we're goin' to all chip in.
"
5,9,Cartman,"HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
"
5,9,Ms. Choksondik,"Eric, the Afghan people need our help!
"
5,9,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!
"
5,9,Wendy,"We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!
"
5,9,Cartman,"That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.
"
5,9,Wendy,"The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!
"
5,9,Cartman,"Yes, but they're sand monkeys!
"
5,9,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, children, we are all sending a dollar to the kids in Afghanistan! That's it! End of discussion!
"
5,9,Cartman,"God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!
"
5,9,Afghan Boys,"Awww!
Well, let's go watch a movie.
Awww!
What do we do now?
Let's go play at my house. There's nothing else we can do. See guys, my parents are home. I hate it when they drop bombs.
What do we do now?
"
5,9,Reporter,"Another high-alert status for terrorists activity this weekend.  The government said ""bad things are likely to happen.""  Meanwhile, the world continues to back down from their support of the United States  saying that they were really only kidding to begin with.
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'.
"
5,9,Sharon,"Can huh get th'ere 'or me? 
"
5,9,Randy,"Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit?  Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else?  Shu-Shu-Sharon? 
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!
"
5,9,Sharon,"Weh, that's nahice.
"
5,9,Stan,"We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;/i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?
"
5,9,Randy,"Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?
"
5,9,Stan,"Well alright. 
"
5,9,"Randy, Sharon","Big brown package from Afghanistan??!!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Dude, what's going on?
"
5,9,Stan,"We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
"
5,9,Hazmat man,"Prelims show negative, sir.
"
5,9,Official,"Then we're gonna have to blow it!
"
5,9,Two SWAT men,"Yes sir!! 
"
5,9,Tweek,"AAHH! This is it, man! It's over!
"
5,9,Richard,"Tweek, calm down. Have some coffee. 
"
5,9,Official,"Open! 
"
5,9,Goat,"Mma-a-a-a-a-a-a. 
"
5,9,Stan,"Oh, it's just a goat. 
"
5,9,People,"Oohhh.
"
5,9,Blond Man,"Look, it's a goat.
"
5,9,Man 1,"Awww.
"
5,9,Brunet Man,"A precious goat.
"
5,9,Goat,"Ba-a-a-a-a. 
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey there, little guy.
"
5,9,Official,"Stay away from it! Terrorists could have given that goat anthrax or smallpox before sending it over! Johnson!!  Check the goat for diseases!
"
5,9,Johnson,"Yes sir!  The goat seems to be clean, sir!
"
5,9,Stan,"I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
"
5,9,Cartman,"Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off.
"
5,9,Official,"Alright, men, this area is secure. Let's head out! 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Well what are we supposed to do with it?
"
5,9,Goat,"Ba-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Stan,"Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
"
5,9,Stan,"Kenny?
"
5,9,Kenny,"(No fuckin' way, dude!)
"
5,9,Stan,"My parents will never let me keep a goat
"
5,9,Cartman,"Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.
"
5,9,Stan,"No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. 
"
5,9,Goat,"Ba-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Uh oh, they're closing!
"
5,9,Stan,"Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?
"
5,9,Postman,"Excuse me?
"
5,9,Cartman,"It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
5,9,Postman,"Afghanistan?  H-I'm sorry boys, but our planes aren't flying there.
"
5,9,Stan,"They're not.
"
5,9,Goat,"Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Postman,"The only planes goin' to Afghanistan are the military planes over at the base. I'm sorry. 
"
5,9,Stan,"Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
"
5,9,Stan,"I don't care! We're going!
"
5,9,Towelie,"Don't forget to bring a towel.
"
5,9,The Boys,"Aaagh!
"
5,9,Cartman,"Oh no, not Towelie.
"
5,9,Towelie,"When goin' someplace new, you should always bring a towel.
"
5,9,Stan,"Okay, thanks, Towelie. 
"
5,9,Towelie,"Do you wanna get high?
"
5,9,Cartman,"No, we don't wanna get high!!
"
5,9,Towelie,"You mean, you don't want Towelie around?
"
5,9,Cartman,"That's right!
"
5,9,Towelie,"So am I to understand that there's been a ...Towelie ban?... 
"
5,9,The Boys,"Awww!
"
5,9,Stan,"Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!
"
5,9,Towelie,"Alright, see ya. 
"
5,9,General,"Alright, troops. We depart for Afghanistan in five minutes! Let's move out!
"
5,9,Stan,"Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.
"
5,9,Soldier 1,"Isn't this exciting, Tony?  We're finally gonna see some action.
"
5,9,Tony,"Yeah, and uh, I hear that as soon as we land we get a USO show.
"
5,9,Soldier 1,"We do!  Stevie Nicks is goin' to perform.
"
5,9,Tony,"Hoh, Stevie Nicks. Huh, I love her! 
"
5,9,Stan,"Okay, it's clear. Come on! 
"
5,9,Soldier,"Hey you!
"
5,9,Tony,"What the hell do you think you're doing here?!
"
5,9,Goat,"...Ba-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Tony,"H-uh, I'm sorry, Miss Nicks, uh.  Hey guys, this is Stevie Nicks. 
"
5,9,Soldier 2,"Oh wow!
"
5,9,Goat,"...Ma-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Soldier 3,"Uh, can I get a picture?
"
5,9,Soldier 4,"Miss Nicks. Over here, Miss Nicks! 
"
5,9,Goat,"...Ma-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Tony,"Oh... M- Miss Nicks, I... I don't wanna bother you, but... could you sing a quick Fleetwood Mac for us. Could ya?
"
5,9,Other Soldiers,"Oh yeah. Please. Come on, come on. Please. Yeah.
"
5,9,Goat,"...Ma-a-a-a-a. Ma-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Soldiers,"Oh! No way! That was wild! That was great!
"
5,9,Soldier 3,"Wait till I tell my sister about this; she is gonna flip!
"
5,9,Stan,"Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.
"
5,9,Tony,"Oh, can we just get a-
"
5,9,Stan,"Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.
"
5,9,Tony,"Oh, sure, we understand. Move along. 
"
5,9,Soldier 3,"...She looks great.
"
5,9,Tony,"She looks great.
"
5,9,Stan,"'K, let's put him on here. 
"
5,9,Goat,"Ma-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Stan,"Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.
"
5,9,Cartman,"Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?
"
5,9,Pilot,"Alright, tango clear. 
"
5,9,The Boys,"Waaah!
"
5,9,Pilot,"Let's head out. 
"
5,9,Cartman,"Aw, son of a bitch!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Hey, wait! There are children in here!
"
5,9,Kenny,"(Oh, shit, we're locked in.)
"
5,9,Goat,"Ma-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Stan,"Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? 
"
5,9,Boys,"Awww! 
"
5,9,Kenny,"(Ee-hew-hoo!)
"
5,9,Cartman,"Uh ho, you guys.
"
5,9,General,"Welcome to Afghanistan, troops! Get your gear ready and report to the barracks at o-nine hundred!
"
5,9,Soldiers,"Sir yes sir! 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Oh God, it was horrible!
"
5,9,Stan,"Twenty hours!
"
5,9,Kenny,"(God-damn, it stinks like shit!)
"
5,9,Goat,"Ma-a-a-a-a! 
"
5,9,Pilot,"What the hell?
"
5,9,Kyle,"Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
"
5,9,Cartman,"It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.
"
5,9,Pilot,"I don't smell any- boh! Oh God!  Hohhgh!  Blagh!  Bleeaagghh 
"
5,9,Cartman,"Uh, whatever!
"
5,9,Kyle,"You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 
"
5,9,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!
"
5,9,Stan,"Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address. 
"
5,9,Goat,"Ma-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Cartman,"God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey look! There's a taxi! 
"
5,9,Performer,"Haa-aa-aa. 
"
5,9,Stan,"Hello. We need to go...  here. 
"
5,9,Cartman,"What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?
"
5,9,Kyle,"Is this the right house?
"
5,9,Stan,"I think so. 
"
5,9,Akmarh,"شما چیزی می‌فروشید؟ ""You guys selling something?""
"
5,9,Stan,"A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?
"
5,9,Akmarh,"Goat? 
"
5,9,Goat,"Ma-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Stan,"Here. Wu-we don't want it.
"
5,9,Akmarh,"Oh, you want something else? All we had was the goat. Your country bombed everything else.
"
5,9,Stan,"No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.
"
5,9,Cartman,"It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. 
"
5,9,Stan,"Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift. 
"
5,9,Afghan Boys,"Yaaay. 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
"
5,9,Stan,"Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.
"
5,9,Fat Boy,"Huh!&#160;!آمریکایی‌ها با خوک می‌خوابن Americans are pig fuckers!
"
5,9,Cartman,"What did you call us?!
"
5,9,Akmarh,"Your country is the evil empire! Your government wants to rule the world! But your values and your spirituality are in the guh-ter!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Then why did you send us the goat?
"
5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"Because, in Afghanistan, we have pride. If you send us something, we must send something in return.
"
5,9,Akmarh,"It doesn't mean we don't still hate you. Now, get out of here! 
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey! Hey, open the door!
"
5,9,Cartman,"I told you! Jawas have no heart.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Jawas?
"
5,9,Cartman,"You know, sand people.
"
5,9,Stan,"How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
"
5,9,Goat,"Ma-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
"
5,9,Stan,"Alright.  Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.
"
5,9,Cartman,"God, I hate you so much, Stan!
"
5,9,Stan,"What?  Howdy. 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
"
5,9,Cartman,"Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!
"
5,9,Stan,"Cartman, you stupid asshole! 
"
5,9,Protester,"...Osama bin Laden! 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Good job, fatass!
"
5,9,Cartman,"Dude, don't call me a Canadian! 
"
5,9,Stan,"You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! 
"
5,9,Cartman,"Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-
"
5,9,Voice,"Amaar madmallah 
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Oooo, alamalamalamalaah.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Oh crap, it's him!
"
5,9,Goat,"Ma-a-a-a-a.
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Amalama hamahamahama?  Una Haqa mala
"
5,9,Cartman,"Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Haqaama hamahalahamahaqa.  U bataqataqaa maladala. Ameriqa la tabakabaka haka haqadaqadaqa  Haqahaqa, daaqadaqa!
"
5,9,Cameraman,"Aaaaand... cut! 
"
5,9,Stan,"Dude, these people are insane.
"
5,9,SNN reporter,"...as more and more case of terrorist-related AIDS continues to grow. And this just in: the Taliban has apparently taken American civilians as hostages. The Taliban has just released this videotape , in which it is clearly visible that they have indeed captured  Stevie Nicks. Miss Nicks appears to be in good spirits, though her whereabouts are unknown.
"
5,9,Randy,"Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days?
"
5,9,Sharon,"Yes. I just saw him.
"
5,9,Randy,"Oh okay. 
"
5,9,SNN Reporter,"With Stevie Nicks in captivity, the other members of Fleetwood Mac have been hidden so the Taliban can't get to them as well. 
"
5,9,Tony,"They... took Stevie Nicks?
"
5,9,Soldier 2,"Bastards! Heartless, gutless bastards!
"
5,9,General,"Alright men! Grab your guns and your Bibles! We are going to get Miss Nicks back!
"
5,9,Soldiers,"Hooray!!! 
"
5,9,SNN Reporter,"The Taliban's video also shows what appears to be four American children in captivity, though they could just be French.
"
5,9,Akmarh,"We have to help them.
"
5,9,Fat Boy,"Do you say??
"
5,9,Akmarh,"They are not espies. They came to give us our goat back.
"
5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"Screw them! They are evil Americans!
"
5,9,Akmarh,"I know! But if we don't help the innocent ones, then we are no better than the Americans are.
"
5,9,Fat Boy,"Help the Americans? That doesn't make sense.
"
5,9,Akmarh,"Dude, we are espeaking English right now. Does that make sense??
"
5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"Alright, let's go. 
"
5,9,Fat Boy,"!ای لعنت ""Oh, goddammit!""

5,9,Stan,"Hey, what are you guys doing here?
"
5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"Shh. We've come to save you.
"
5,9,Kyle,"But I thought you hate us.
"
5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"We do. 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Cartman, where are you going??
"
5,9,Cartman,"I'm gonna go take care of this prick!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Cartman, he's crazy!
"
5,9,Cartman,"He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. 
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"A flippity flappity floop! Jihad jihad!

5,9,Cartman,"Mehah...  What's up, bin Laden?

"
5,9,Kyle,"Where do we go? 
"
5,9,Akmarh,"Get down! 
"
5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"!اوه الله! کشتن کیوانو ""Oh, my God! They killed Keyvan!""

5,9,Akmarh,"!تو، دیوث ""You bastards!""  You... murdering Americaaans!!
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.
"
5,9,Akmarh,"America DID eh-start this war! They eh-started it YEARS ago, when they put their military bases on Muslim holy lands!
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Ramadan!

5,9,Cartman,"Hey look! An infidel! 
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Wuut? Peitoqaba! 
"
5,9,Cartman,"So that's what this is all about?
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Ishta fatwa open sesame!

5,9,Cartman,"Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass of a chicken!
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Proila foqabam!

"
5,9,General,"We're coming, Miss Nicks! Hang on!
"
5,9,Goat,"Ma-a-a-a! Ma-a-a-a!
"
5,9,Kyle,"All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.
"
5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"And you believe it? It is not just the Taliban that hates America. Over a third of the world hates America!
"
5,9,Stan,"But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
"
5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"Because, you don't realize that a third of the world hates you!!!
"
5,9,Stan,"...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
"
5,9,Akmarh,"You're butt-holes!
"
5,9,"Stan, Kyle","You're buttholes!
"
5,9,Female voice,"Youhoo.

5,9,Cartman,"Haduqaduqaduqa.  Huqadukadukadukaduuu. 
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Oh bella, bella falafel. Mi amore. Fatwa, fatwa. Ahh, de vino! Mi fatwa! J'ai une fatwa! 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
"
5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"It's better than a civilization that spends its time watching millionaires walk down the red carpet at the Emmys!
"
5,9,Stan,"...He's got us there, dude. 
"
5,9,Tony,"I got her. I got Stevie Nicks. 
"
5,9,Goat,"Me-e-e-eh.
"
5,9,Cartman,"There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create! 
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Oh, dapidiuta ako. 
"
5,9,Cartman,"Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?!  Oh, you look marvelous, dahling.
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Haqa hamahama.
"
5,9,Cartman,"Come on! The cameras are ready!  Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras.  Oh, and here's your microphone. 
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Ogh. America adirqadirqa-  Uh ohhh.
"
5,9,Osama and the Taliban Soldiers,"HAAAAAAGH! 
"
5,9,General,"We've done it! The Taliban is destroyed!
"
5,9,Soldiers,"Hoorayyy!!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
"
5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Terrorists is the craziest peoples. Eheeee! 
"
5,9,Soldier,"I got him! I got him!
"
5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"Well, it looks like the Taliban and bin Laden are finally out of power.
"
5,9,Akmarh,"Yeup, you don't need us anymore. 
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"That's fine. But we still hate you. 
"
5,9,Stan,"Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.
"
5,9,Akmarh,"Maybe. In time. 
"
5,9,Kyle,"I'm confused.
"
5,9,General,"Great job, troops! Once again we have killed our enemies!
"
5,9,Soldier 5,"Hooray!
"
5,9,Soldier 6,"Hooray! Yeah, we sure did!
"
5,9,General,"The world is now safe, thanks to you. And so now, as promised, here is Fleetwood Mac with Stevie Nicks!
"
5,9,Soldiers,"Whoa. Yeah. 
"
5,9,Fleetwood Mac,"Just like the wild winged bird sings a song-Stand back, she's singin'.
"
5,9,Goat,"Maaa
"
5,9,Fleetwood Mac,"Baby
"
5,9,Goat,"Maaa
"
5,9,Fleetwood Mac,"Babe
"
5,9,Goat,"Maa-ha 
"
5,9,Stan,"Come on, let's go get to the plane. 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
"
5,9,Stan,"No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
5,9,Stan,"Go America.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Go America.  Go Broncos. 
"
5,9,Stan,"Yeah, go Broncos.
"
5,9,Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
5,10,Photographer,"Okay, now lift your chin a little.  Look right here. Right here.  Hey, where's my smile? Come on, I bet you got a smile for me. I-I'm startin' to see a smile.  There it is.  Okay great, next.
"
5,10,Stan,"I didn't smile. 
"
5,10,Kyle,"I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
"
5,10,Butters,"Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. 
"
5,10,Photographer,"Okay, smile  Okay, next? 
"
5,10,Stan,"Did you go yet?
"
5,10,Kyle,"No. This is taking forever.
"
5,10,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!
"
5,10,Kyle,"What, Cartman?
"
5,10,Cartman,"Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! . Kenny, Kenny, over here! 
"
5,10,Kyle,"It isn't that funny, Cartman.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Yes it is! 
"
5,10,Ms. Choksondik,"Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids! 
"
5,10,Cartman,"...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.
"
5,10,Photographer,"Take off your hat, please.
"
5,10,Kyle,"But I never take off my hat.
"
5,10,Photographer,"Come on now, I bet your parents want a picture of YOU lookin' natural.
"
5,10,Kyle,"This is how I look natural.
"
5,10,Ms. Choksondik,"Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today!
"
5,10,Kyle,"Crap. 
"
5,10,Photographer,"Smile! Come on, where's that smile? Is it gonna kill you to smile? I see a smile.  Next!
"
5,10,Kyle,"Gay-ass. 
"
5,10,Photographer,"Very nice. Okay, last one? 
"
5,10,Cartman,"Uh oh. 
"
5,10,Photographer,"Okay, have a seat, young man.  Well, okay, lookin' great. Now where's that smile? Come on, give me a nice, wide smile. Wider. Perfect! 
"
5,10,Cartman,"Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?
"
5,10,Photographer,"Should be about four days.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!
"
5,10,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out-
"
5,10,Cartman,"YES! YES!
"
5,10,Ms. Choksondik,"Most of them are very nice. But, apparently, one of you thinks it's fun to spoil their school pictures , and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office!
"
5,10,Kenny,"(Aww, that's bullshit!)
"
5,10,Ms. Choksondik,"School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo back, Butters! 
"
5,10,Butters,"Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.
"
5,10,Ms. Choksondik,"For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely.
"
5,10,Butters,"But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! 
"
5,10,Cartman,"Let me see! 
"
5,10,Butters,"Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!
"
5,10,Kenny,"(You've ever done?!)
"
5,10,Cartman,"Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! 
"
5,10,Ms. Choksondik,"Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!
"
5,10,Ms. Choksondik,"You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters!
"
5,10,Cartman,"I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
"
5,10,Butters,"I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
"
5,10,Ms. Choksondik,"Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office. 
"
5,10,Butters,"My mom?  Oh, sweet Jesus!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea... ever!
"
5,10,Receptionist,"Welcome to South Park Milk Company. Can I help you?
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? 
"
5,10,Receptionist,"Oh, of course. Printing those photos on our milk really does help. Do you have the photo with you?
"
5,10,Cartman,"Yes, I have it right hmya. 
"
5,10,Receptionist,"O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately.
"
5,10,Cartman,"You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for your help.
"
5,10,Receptionist,"Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo? 
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye.  Brown eye! 
"
5,10,Receptionist,"Okay, brown eye...
"
5,10,Cartman,"And, and big rosy cheeks! 
"
5,10,Receptionist,"...Full cheeks...
"
5,10,Cartman,"Full cheeks!  Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! 
"
5,10,Reporter,"Ms. Hamilton was the fourth person to be run over by a motorcycle this week, leaving a city to ponder, who will be next? 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Hello?
"
5,10,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! You guys! 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Hello?
"
5,10,Cartman,"...You guys!... 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
5,10,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry. 
"
5,10,Stan,"What's he want?
"
5,10,Kyle,"I don't know. Let's go see. 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Why'd you call us?
"
5,10,Cartman,"Come on. Come on.  Come on. Oho, this is so sweet!  You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!
"
5,10,Stan,"Goddamnit Cartman, what?! 
"
5,10,Kyle,"...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
"
5,10,Cartman,"Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! 
"
5,10,Stan,"That isn't funny, Cartman.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!
"
5,10,Kyle,"No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
"
5,10,Cartman,"No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.
"
5,10,Martha,"Oh my God. Oh my God!  Steven! Steven, come quick!
"
5,10,Steven,"What is it, Martha?
"
5,10,Martha,"Look. It's him! It's... our son.
"
5,10,Steven,"Our ssson!
"
5,10,Martha,"...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just knew the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy.
"
5,10,Receptionist,"... yes, I see.  Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported missing, not found.
"
5,10,Steven,"We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition.
"
5,10,Receptionist,"...Riiight.
"
5,10,Steven,"You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
"
5,10,Receptionist,"...Really?
"
5,10,Steven,"Yes.
"
5,10,Martha,"Steven and I have a condition called ""torsonic polarity syndrome."" It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically.
"
5,10,Steven,"Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS.
"
5,10,Receptionist,"Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing.
"
5,10,Steven,"Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France.
"
5,10,Receptionist,"So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?
"
5,10,Steven,"No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages...
"
5,10,Receptionist,"Well, Mr. and Mrs...
"
5,10,Steven,"Uh, Thompssson.
"
5,10,Receptionist,"...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together.
"
5,10,Martha,"Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again!
"
5,10,Steven,"Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?
"
5,10,Martha,"You're right. You're right.
"
5,10,Kyle,"...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God.  Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right?  And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. 
"
5,10,Stan,"...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
"
5,10,Cartman,"No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! 
"
5,10,Kyle,"...Nuh uh.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.  Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. 
"
5,10,Martha,"Hello, we're Mr. and Mrs. Thompson. 
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh God.
"
5,10,Kyle,"Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!
"
5,10,Stan,"No way! 
"
5,10,Steven,"We understand you've seen our son. 
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh my... God. 
"
5,10,Stan,"Cartman, where are you going?? 
"
5,10,Martha,"Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?
"
5,10,Kyle,"Uh
"
5,10,Stan,"Oh boy.
"
5,10,Kyle,"Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
"
5,10,Stan,"Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
"
5,10,Martha,"Oh thank you. Thank you! 
"
5,10,Receptionist,"Well?
"
5,10,Steven,"They said to inquire four houses down.
"
5,10,Martha,"Let's hurry! 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
5,10,Stan,"Yeah, you missed them turning around.
"
5,10,Cartman,"You guys, something's wrong.
"
5,10,Stan,"What?
"
5,10,Cartman,"I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
"
5,10,Kyle,"Blew a funny fuse?
"
5,10,Cartman,"It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
"
5,10,Clyde,"You mean they both have butts instead of heads?
"
5,10,Stan,"Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.
"
5,10,Token,"How do they eat?
"
5,10,Stan,"How the hell should we know? 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
"
5,10,Butters,"W-what?
"
5,10,Kyle,"You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
"
5,10,Stan,"There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
"
5,10,Butters,"Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
"
5,10,Stan,"But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!
"
5,10,Linda,"Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!
"
5,10,Butters,"Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.
"
5,10,Linda,"You made a goofy face!
"
5,10,Butters,"No! That's just what I look like. See?
"
5,10,Linda,"...Don't you make that face at me, young man!
"
5,10,Butters,"I'm not makin' a face, mom!
"
5,10,Linda,"Stop it!
"
5,10,Craig,"...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.
"
5,10,Kyle,"Alright. 
"
5,10,Linda,"Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! 
"
5,10,Butters,"Another week?  I hate my stupid face.
"
5,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?
"
5,10,Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?
"
5,10,Mr. Mackey,"Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
"
5,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?
"
5,10,Cartman,"You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
"
5,10,Mr. Mackey,"Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.
"
5,10,Cartman,"So does that mean I'll never laugh again?
"
5,10,Mr. Mackey,"It's possible, hm'kay?  But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, ""Friends"" . Ohokahay, huhuh.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Ugh.
"
5,10,Mrs. McCormick,"...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton.
"
5,10,Martha,"Yes. Yes, I see.
"
5,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology? 
"
5,10,Martha,"...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up.
"
5,10,Steven,"It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be.
"
5,10,Stuart and Mrs. McCormick,"Really?
"
5,10,Receptionist,"Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?
"
5,10,Steven,"Tommy disappeared when he was only seven.
"
5,10,Martha,"Oh, Steven, it's like it's all happening all over again. 
"
5,10,Mrs. McCormick,"There there now. 
"
5,10,Receptionist,"Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright.  Listen, the South Park Dairy Company is the country's largest. We find lost children all the time.  We can help you find Tommy with the company's database!
"
5,10,Mrs. McCormick,"Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!
"
5,10,Martha,"Ah, agh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
"
5,10,Receptionist,"Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?
"
5,10,Steven,"Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time.
"
5,10,Martha,"The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why.  We think perhaps she wanted a child of her own. 
"
5,10,Receptionist,"And this was back in Wisconsin? 
"
5,10,Steven,"Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west.  That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense.
"
5,10,Martha,"We've tried every avenue to find him,  but, we've never tried the milk company. 
"
5,10,Receptionist,"Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk  is not only the best resource for finding kids,  but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer. 
"
5,10,Martha,"Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us. 
"
5,10,Steven,"This certainly is a friendly town.  You've all been sssssso wonderful. 
"
5,10,Martha,"Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again.
"
5,10,"Stuart and wife, and Receptionist","NO!
"
5,10,Male 1,"Dude, why are you wearing Shalayna's panties? 
"
5,10,Male 2,"I have to wear Shalayna's panties. Lisa's were in the wash.  Look, can we just get this over with?
"
5,10,Male 1,"But dude, I can't French-kiss him. He's my grandpa! 
"
5,10,Male 2,"Come on, dude.
"
5,10,Male 1,"Oh, alright  Here it goes. Come'ere, Grandpa.
"
5,10,Audience,"Aww
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh, dude, oh.
"
5,10,Jonesy,"Dude, what's wrong with you?
"
5,10,Cartman,"Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
"
5,10,Male 1,"Well, I'm glad that's over with. We'd better go back to the house now to see how Chris is doing. 
"
5,10,President,"Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons.
"
5,10,Steven,"Please, please. It's not your fault.
"
5,10,President,"Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room.  As you can see, we keep it close to the refrigeration room. That way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible.  That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself.
"
5,10,Martha,"Amazing.
"
5,10,President,"Here, try a glass of our cold Vitamin D. And our fresh scones. 
"
5,10,Steven,"Delicious.
"
5,10,Martha,"Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition. 
"
5,10,Steven,"Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
"
5,10,President,"Really? Well. And in here we have our Missing Child Resource Center. 
"
5,10,Martha,"Oh my, isn't this impressive?
"
5,10,President,"Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases.
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"We'll start the computer on a data search. Now, when did your son turn up missing?
"
5,10,Steven,"Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time.
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"Alright then. Computer...
"
5,10,Computer,"Workiiing.
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"Run a scan of missing children since 1982. Check for physical birth defects called TPS.
"
5,10,Computer,"TPS. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome. Child missing since 1982. Workiiing.
"
5,10,President,"So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years?
"
5,10,Martha,"That's right.
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now?
"
5,10,Steven,"Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo,  we assumed someone had seen him since we did.
"
5,10,Martha,"This is the only photo we have of our little Tommy. 
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids.
"
5,10,President,"Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk do her work, and I'll take you two out for some good old Colorado chili. 
"
5,10,Steven,"We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! 
"
5,10,Jimmy,"What's this all about?
"
5,10,Cartman,"Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.
"
5,10,Cartman,"I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Okay, let me have it.
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?
"
5,10,Cartman,"Okay, why?
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...  eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken. 
"
5,10,Cartman,"...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Who's there?
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Orange.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Orange who?
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?
"
5,10,Cartman,"...naw, that didn't work either.
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Who's there?
"
5,10,Jimmy,"An interrupting ca'ow.
"
5,10,Cartman,"An interrupting cow who
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Moooooo!  ...What a terrific audience. 
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer?
"
5,10,Computer,"Workiiing.
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"Scan for any children reported found in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a facial deformity.
"
5,10,Computer,"Workiiing.  Negative.
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"Ugh. This is hopeless! ...Wait a minute, let's try it this way: Computer?
"
5,10,Computer,"Workiiing.
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"Scan databanks for children who reported their parents missing.
"
5,10,Computer,"Workiiing.  One million six thousand hits.
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"Alright, then break it down to claims in the past twenty years.
"
5,10,Computer,"Workiiing.  Three hundred twenty-one thousand hits.
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk.
"
5,10,Computer,"In skim form, homogenized has longer shelf life by 2.3 weeks.
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S.
"
5,10,Computer,"Torsonic Polarity Syndrome, plus, a claim to not know parents: one match
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"Bingo. Do you have a photo
"
5,10,Computer,"Printiiing. 
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"My God. Oh my God!
"
5,10,Kyle,"Butters! Hey Butters!
"
5,10,Butters,"Hehyeah?
"
5,10,Kyle,"They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
"
5,10,Butters,"Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.
"
5,10,Stan,"Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
"
5,10,Butters,"Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.
"
5,10,Stephen,"Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?
"
5,10,Butters,"I sure am, Dad!
"
5,10,Stephen,"Alright, you can take the paper bag off.
"
5,10,Butters,"Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-
"
5,10,Stephen,"Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!
"
5,10,Butters,"Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-
"
5,10,Stephen,"Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious!
"
5,10,Butters,"I'm not wearin' makeup Dad! I uh-
"
5,10,Stephen,"Put that bag back on!
"
5,10,Butters,"Yes, sir. 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Dude, that poor kid. 
"
5,10,Clyde,"Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. 
"
5,10,Cartman,"Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.
"
5,10,Cartman,"And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.
Eric.
"
5,10,President,"And so it is with great pride that we have flown little Billy Thompson out here, to be reunited with his parents for the first time in twenty years.  Mrs. Garthunk? 
"
5,10,Mrs. Garthunk,"Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud to be an employee of South Park Milk,  which to date has found over a hundred thousand missing kids, and, led the way in the fight against curdling. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, your son grew up not knowing who his parents were.  But he was strong and resilient,  and ended up becoming very successful. I think it will amaze you as it will all of us to learn that your son... is Ben Affleck! 
"
5,10,President,"Come around here, Ben! 
"
5,10,Ben Affleck,"Mom! Dad!
"
5,10,Steven,"Son!
"
5,10,Martha,"Oh, son! 
"
5,10,Cartman,"What's goin' on?
"
5,10,Stan,"Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!
"
5,10,Steven,"Oh, our same ol' Ben!
"
5,10,Martha,"Oh, I'm so happy! 
"
5,10,Mr. Garrison,"Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but I definitely see the resemblance now. 
"
5,10,Steven,"Aw, son. 
"
5,10,President,"Isn't this wonderful?
"
5,10,Photographer,"Okay gang, give me a big smile. 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.
"
5,10,Stan,"Hey, you're laughing, Cartman.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
"
5,10,Cartman,"A-heh, what?
"
5,10,Kyle,"Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
"
5,10,Stan,"Huh?
"
5,10,Kyle,"When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
"
5,10,Stan,"Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
"
5,10,Cartman,"E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
"
5,10,Kyle,"There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! 
"
5,10,Motorcycle Driver,"Dangit! 
"
5,10,Stan,"Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
"
5,10,Kyle,"Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
"
5,10,Stan,"Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.
"
5,10,Steven,"Aw son! 
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Jesus Christ, these lines are ridiculous! I'm gonna miss my flight!  E- Excuse me, there are two other security checkpoints. Why can't you open those, too?
"
5,11,Security Guard,"Uh I don't know nothin'.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"But you work for the-  uh, God-damnit!!
"
5,11,Voice,"Snooty Airlines announces the arrival of flight 239 from Connecticut.
"
5,11,Sheila,"That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us.
"
5,11,Kyle,"What's he look like?
"
5,11,Sheila,"He's your age and about your height.
"
5,11,Kyle,"I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 
"
5,11,Ike,"I todd a nurra.
"
5,11,Sheila,"Oh, there he is.  Over here, Kyle! 
"
5,11,Kyle Schwartz,"Hello, Aunt Sheila.
"
5,11,Sheila,"How was your flight? 
"
5,11,Kyle Schwartz,"Oh, it was terrible. They recycled the air on board and it really did a number on my asthma. I-I-e-I asked them to turn up the oxygen and they wouldn't. 
"
5,11,Sheila,"You remember Uncle Gerry.
"
5,11,Kyle Schwartz,"Hi, Uncle Gerry.
"
5,11,Sheila,"And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Hey dude.
"
5,11,Kyle Schwartz,"It's nice to meet you.
"
5,11,Sheila,"Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle. 
"
5,11,Both Kyles,"Okay:
"
5,11,Sheila,"Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles now. We'll just call you  Kyle, and you can be Kyle...  Two! 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Cool. 
"
5,11,Clerk,"Next?
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, I feel like I've run a marathon. 
"
5,11,Clerk,"Mmmokay, the 2:30 flight to Cheyenne has boarded. Looks like you didn't make it.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"What? Well of course I didn't make it. The line to check in was two hours long, and the security line was two hours more!
"
5,11,Clerk,"Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!
"
5,11,Clerk,"Would you like a window or an aisle seat?
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"This is unbelievable! You know, I seem to remember when the airlines said, ""We need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-""!
"
5,11,Clerk,"Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left?
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well we gave them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway! So now we have three people to clear 400 passengers!
"
5,11,Man,"Hey, he's right!
"
5,11,People,"YEAH!
"
5,11,Clerk,"Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"So where did that money go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into the pockets of the presidents and CEOs of the airlines, so they can keep their multimillion dollar salaries!
"
5,11,People,"YEAH!
"
5,11,Clerk,"And here's your boarding pass for tomorrow morning.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"You think you can treat us however you want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna come up with a NEW mode of transportation! A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put all you bastards out of business!
"
5,11,People,"YEAH! ALRIGHT! GO!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"You think I can't do it?! I got a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Denver Community College! You watch me!!  Come on, everybody!
"
5,11,People,"YEAH!
"
5,11,Man,"Can I get on that 7:30 a.m. flight?
"
5,11,Sheila,"Here we go, Kyle Two.  And here's yours, Kyle. 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh is, is this beef?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Yeah, dude, it's great! 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
"
5,11,Sheila,"Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
"
5,11,Sheila,"Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?
"
5,11,Kyle,"We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
"
5,11,Sheila,"I'll put it in the microwave right away. 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Mom?
"
5,11,Sheila,"Yes, Kyle Two?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"How am I related to him again?
"
5,11,Sheila,"He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin?
"
5,11,Sheila,"He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"So we have the same blood?
"
5,11,Sheila,"Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?
"
5,11,Sheila,"I'm sure your friends will love him.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart!
"
5,11,Sheila,"Kyle Two, he's your responsibility.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Oh my God.
"
5,11,Sheila,"I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Well what do you mean?  What room is he sleeping in?
"
5,11,Kyle,"What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"I don't know, dude.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"I don't think so.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Okay. 
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either!
"
5,11,Mr. Hat,"What was wrong with that plan?
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A moped would be too dangerous at those speeds. Damnit!  Now, what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle?
"
5,11,Mr. Hat,"Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass around.
"
5,11,Enrique Iglesias,"...I think about you day and night. I think about you...
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say?
"
5,11,Mr. Hat,"I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"That's it. Gyration.  A gyroscope.  It would allow for maximum balance and yet... Mr. Hat! You're a genius!  It's so simple and yet genius!
"
5,11,Mr. Hat,"Check out his hot bulge, too.
"
5,11,Stan,"Hey dude.
"
5,11,Cartman,"What's that thing?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Cartman, I need to talk to you. 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal.
"
5,11,Cartman,"What?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Forty bucks?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Alright, alright.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"And you especially can't say anything about Jews!
"
5,11,Cartman,"Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it? 
"
5,11,Kyle,"I can't believe how cold it is out here.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Alright. 
"
5,11,Kyle,"It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend-ish.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
"
5,11,Cartman,"...Oh, man.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Cartman?!
"
5,11,Cartman,"Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. 
"
5,11,Stan,"What the hell was that?
"
5,11,Officer Barbrady,"Uh what the hell was that?
"
5,11,Stuart,"What the hell was that?
"
5,11,Randy,"I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one.
"
5,11,Stuart,"Yep, me too.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone!  Well what are you waiting for?!
"
5,11,Ms. Choksondik,"And I know you'll all be very nice to our new student.  Kyle, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.
"
5,11,Kyle,"...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
"
5,11,Cartman,"I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!
"
5,11,Ms. Choksondik,"Okay, why don't you go ahead and take a seat, Kyle? 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
"
5,11,Ms. Choksondik,"Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"What?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Eh, oh, alright. 
"
5,11,Ms. Choksondik,"Now let's get on with our lesson on the-
"
5,11,Kyle,"Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Ugh, ugh!
"
5,11,Ms. Choksondik,"I'm sorry, Kyle. You'll just have to make do.  Now let's get back to the le-
"
5,11,Kyle,"Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
"
5,11,Ms. Choksondik,"Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In my class you need to be able to concentrate.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Oh!
"
5,11,Ms. Choksondik,"Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"CARTMAN!
"
5,11,Anchor,"Kindergarten teacher Herbert Garrison has apparently invented a new vehicle that will give the airlines a run for their money. Mr. Garrison is putting the final touches on his top secret device, which he simply calls ""IT"".  So what exactly is ""IT""?  Here with a report is a Hispanic man with some gravy stains on his lapel. 
"
5,11,Hispanic Reporter,"Thanks, Tom, I-oh...  Thanks, Tom. So far, Herbert Garrison hasn't let anyone get a look at his invention. He claims that the vehicle is sooo genius and revolutionary that it could cause one's eyes to bleed if not properly prepared to see it. But earlier today HBC News got footage of some of the country's top investors and richest people who have been invited for a first look, including: Steve Forbes , Steve Jobs , Ted Turner , Donald Trump , Bill Gates , and Yasmine Bleeth . Their curiosity is piqued, Tom, and so is ours. What is ""IT""? What does ""IT""do? And when will IT be somewhere where I can buy one? Reporting live, Jeff Arrando , HBC News.

5,11,Kyle Two,"You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, ""Catch the Ball."" I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me.

5,11,Kyle,"Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"It's fine!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it.  Alright, here we go. 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Now what?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Now throw it back to me.
"
5,11,Kyle,"But it's down in the snow.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"...So dig it out.
"
5,11,Kyle,"But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"...Well, then we'll dry them off!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Alright, then. 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Oh my God.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Yeah! They WERE, Cartman!
"
5,11,Cartman,"Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"You did, too! You are so full of crap!
"
5,11,Cartman,"No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, ""Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?"" And I was all like, ""No way!"" And this little light went on in my head like, ""Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin."" But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"You blew the deal, Cartman!
"
5,11,Cartman,"Goddamnit, give me another chance!
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You ripped on him, deal's off!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Uh you did what? 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Oh no.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Haha,  serves you right, asshole. 
"
5,11,Kyle,"You, you paid your friends tuh...  not make fun of me?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Kyle, I-eh I'm sorry.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"What?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Uh-uh-uh oh, dude. Uh 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Boy it sure is dry out here.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports!
"
5,11,Mr. Hat,"That sounds incredible, Mr. Garrison.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible  is IT's patented gyroscope design.  Gentlemen, I give you, IT!
"
5,11,Guests,"Whoa.
"
5,11,Steve Forbes,"Nice.
"
5,11,Donald Trump,"Sweet.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour.
"
5,11,Guests,"Whoa. Wow.
"
5,11,Bill Gates,"This will change everything.
"
5,11,Steve Jobs,"We're going to have to rethink cities!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Now, IT is easily operated using four flexigrip handles. Two of them are on each side. Left side for throttle, right side for steering.  The third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus, to keep the driver in place. 
"
5,11,Guests,"Ugh. Oh.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such.  Put the four together and we're ready to go. 
"
5,11,Steve Jobs,"Oh my God! 
"
5,11,Steve Forbes,"Look at it go! 
"
5,11,Bill Gates,"But the way it works... do you think people will go through that to travel?
"
5,11,Steve Forbes,"Hey, it... still beats what you go through at the airports.
"
5,11,Guest 1,"True.
"
5,11,Guest 2,"Yup.
"
5,11,Guest 3,"Yeah, that's true.
"
5,11,Guest 4,"Yeap.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane.
"
5,11,Stan,"I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews.
"
5,11,Stan,"Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Ya see?
"
5,11,Kyle,"I'm ba-ack!
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Ugh.
"
5,11,Stan,"Book. Later, dude. 
"
5,11,Jeff Arrando,"Tom, the day is finally here. IT has arrived for retail sale, and people are getting their first look at it.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, good. Just step through here  And then this is your steering and here's your throttle.
"
5,11,Craig's father,"Okay. 
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch.
"
5,11,Craig's father,"HAAAOW!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"It's alright, it's just locking you in.  You can take it.  Doing great, Kathy. How's that ride?  Okay, now use your mouth to operate the turn signals, and you're off.  Great! Who else wants to give it a spin? 
"
5,11,Randy,"Oh, man, it that the IT?
"
5,11,Craig's Father,"Hehyeah.
"
5,11,Stuart,"How is it?
"
5,11,Craig's Father,"Well, ugh. Ih ih it beats dealing with the airline companies, that's for sure. 
"
5,11,Kyle,"I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn.
"
5,11,Kyle,"It seems like I might get splinters, though.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Hang on!
"
5,11,Kyle,"I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"How far do you think it is to Connecticut?
"
5,11,Kyle,"It's a least a couple of hours.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Think he'll be alright?
"
5,11,Cartman,"He's faaahn.
"
5,11,Announcer,"Are you tired of corporate airline companies treating you like a worthless sardine?  Tired of ridiculous lines and horrible security at airports?  Well, now there is an alternative to airline travel.  IT.  IT has taken the country by storm.  And already two million have been sold.  Never have another important business trip ruined by airline incompetence.  Hey ladies! How did you get to the Grand Canyon?  IT comes in sizes for the entire family.
"
5,11,Woman,"Here you go, Robby. 
"
5,11,John Travolta,"Hello, I'm John Travolta. I used to rely on airlines to get me to set, but once I got used to IT,  I found it to be a little less painful than dealing with the airline companies. I just power up the flexigrips.  And I'm ready to go. Thank you, IT. 
"
5,11,Announcer,"So join the millions of Americans who have felt a little more comfortable with... traveling.  Order yours today and remember our slogan: IT's better than flying.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"...Hm, that was pretty gay. 
"
5,11,Sheila,"Kyle Two, where is Kyle?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding.
"
5,11,Sheila,"Where on earth could he be? 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut.
"
5,11,Sheila,"What?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her.
"
5,11,Sheila,"Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility. 
"
5,11,Kyle,"I'm ba-ack.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"AAA!
"
5,11,Kyle,"I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"A, a bus. R-really?
"
5,11,Sheila,"Kyle, what happened to you??
"
5,11,Kyle,"Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Oh no- don't worry about it, dude.
"
5,11,Sheila,"Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes.  Are you alright?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"We're in the money, Mr. Hat, We're in the money, Mr. Hat...  Oh hi, Jimbo. Can I help you?
"
5,11,Jimbo,"Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, right, right. Take a seat.
"
5,11,Jimbo,"Uh, that's okay, I'll stand.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby?
"
5,11,Randy,"Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Sure.
"
5,11,Randy,"Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Yeup.
"
5,11,Randy,"Well... so... they don't really... do anything.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Right.
"
5,11,Randy,"So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I... guess you could. 
"
5,11,Man 1,"Huh?
"
5,11,Man 2,"Whazzat?
"
5,11,Man 3,"Wha- what did you- what did he say?
"
5,11,Man 4,"What?
"
5,11,Kyle,"I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport.
"
5,11,Stan,"Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave.  Ey! Can we speed things up here??
"
5,11,Security Guard,"Daaah, sorry, but ever since that IT thing came out the airlines have had to cut back on employees.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?!
"
5,11,Security Guard,"Derr, let's see: Twelve people... plus... times... divided... two hours domestic, three hours international.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"No!
"
5,11,Security Guard,"Dah ha! What's this?! A toenail clipper!  Die, terrorist! 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus!! 
"
5,11,Security Guard,"See, we do these checks for a reason!
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"This is ridiculous! Come on! 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Okay, Cartman, you're it. Start counting. 
"
5,11,Cartman,"1, 2, 3, 4...
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Here, Kyle. You go hide in here. 
"
5,11,Kyle,"In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"JUST GET IN THE BOX!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"I hope he doesn't suffocate.
"
5,11,Cartman,"He's faaahn.
"
5,11,Stan,"Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?
"
5,11,Agent 1,"It's alright, we're with the government.
"
5,11,Agent 2,"We're just shutting you down.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Shutting me down? Why?
"
5,11,Agent 3,"The airlines are in desperate trouble. Your vehicle is causing them to lose money.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down!
"
5,11,Agent 4,"Right, so the government is bailing the airlines out again, by shutting you down and making ITs illegal.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"OH, GOD-DAMNIT! You'd better be kidding! 
"
5,11,Agent 5,"Sir, many people work for the airlines. We can't let them all be fired.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"THE AIRLINE COMPANIES ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE AND THEIR OWN INEFFICIENCY!!
"
5,11,Agent 6,"That may be true. But if you build, sell, or ride another IT, ""it"" will be the last time. Have a nice night. 
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs! You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons of bitch airlines! 
"
5,11,Sheila,"Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air.
"
5,11,Sheila,"I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"I already checked the playground, Ma.  I told you, he isn't really- 
"
5,11,Kyle,"I'm back.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"GAAAH! 
"
5,11,Sheila,"Kyle!  You're back!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
"
5,11,Stan,"So dude, did Cartman's idea work?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home.
"
5,11,Stan,"Damn!
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"...What?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.
"
5,11,Sheila,"Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Do you promise??  I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon.  Not too soon, I hope.
"
5,11,Stan,"Yeah, haha.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Heheheheheh. 
"
5,11,All Three,"Five million dollars??? 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Dudedudedude! You- you have five million dollars??
"
5,11,Kyle,"Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay!
"
5,11,"Stan, Cartman","Yeah!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Re- really?
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Yeah. You see, I've learned something today.  Sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,...  and um... Let's see, what did I learn about?  What did I learn about today?
"
5,11,Cartman,"I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"... Uhwhat?
"
5,11,Kyle,"I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 
"
5,11,Kyle Two,"Dude! Weak.
"
5,11,Cartman,"...Good job, Jew!
"
5,12,Butters,"...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.
"
5,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check.
"
5,12,Butters,"Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got a check. That's like a C!
"
5,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Okay. Whose project should we look at next? How aboouuut Eric?  Eric Cartman?
"
5,12,Cartman,"Stand by, please.
"
5,12,Ms. Choksondik,"NOW Eric!
"
5,12,Cartman,"Oh, god dammit!
"
5,12,Kyle,"Haha!
"
5,12,Cartman,"Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.
"
5,12,Ms. Choksondik,"You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!
"
5,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Siddown. 
"
5,12,Cartman,"I'll make you eat your parents!
"
5,12,Ms. Choksondik,"What did you say?!
"
5,12,Cartman,"Nothing! 
"
5,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, Token, you're next. 
"
5,12,Token,"Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site.  I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months. 
"
5,12,Clyde,"Wwooww.
"
5,12,Token,"I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik. 
"
5,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Very very good, Token. You get a check plus.
"
5,12,Token,"Alright! 
"
5,12,Cartman,"Aw, that is such bullcrap!
"
5,12,Ms. Choksondik,"Eric, for the love of God. 
"
5,12,Cartman,"No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!
"
5,12,Token,"My family isn't rich.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
"
5,12,Stan,"Your family is rich, dude.
"
5,12,Token,"But I...
"
5,12,Cartman,"Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani Exchange!
"
5,12,Kyle,"Aharmani Exchange?
"
5,12,Cartman,"All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so! 
"
5,12,Stan,"Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.
"
5,12,Butters,"Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? 
"
5,12,Linda,"Hello Token. How was school today?
"
5,12,Token,"Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park? 
"
5,12,Bob,"Well, because we have more money, son.
"
5,12,Token,"I know. But why?
"
5,12,Bob,"...W-well, because we went to graduate school and therefore have more lucrative jobs than most people in town. For instance, your mother is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company, whereas your friend Eric Cartman's mother is a crack whore. One pays more than the other.
"
5,12,Linda,"Why, sweetie? What's the matter?
"
5,12,Token,"All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.
"
5,12,Bob,"...Oh.
"
5,12,Token,"I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!
"
5,12,Linda,"J mart?
"
5,12,Bob,"Son, you, you don't know what you're saying.
"
5,12,Token,"I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please. 
"
5,12,Bob,"You... sure you want to do this, son?
"
5,12,Token,"I'm sure. 
"
5,12,Linda,"Hmmm...
"
5,12,Bob,"Where's the... valet?
"
5,12,Linda,"He must be parkiing someone else's car.
"
5,12,Bob,"Ah, here we go.  Take good care of it, please.  Here's twenty dollars.  Hoh?  They've activated some kind of alien blinding device.
"
5,12,Token,"That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting.
"
5,12,Bob,"Oh.
"
5,12,Linda,"Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel? 
"
5,12,Obese Woman,"Aisle 6, next to the pretzels.
"
5,12,Bob,"Next to the-?!
"
5,12,Token,"Come on!  Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think?
"
5,12,Linda,"What, what brand are they?
"
5,12,Token,"It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants.
"
5,12,Randy,"Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?
"
5,12,Sharon,"Huh?  Oh. Yeah, it is.  What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek. 
"
5,12,Liane,"Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.
"
5,12,Sheila,"I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year. 
"
5,12,Bob,"S-son, can you just hurry it up? I don't think we quite fit n here.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.
"
5,12,Token,"Hey you guys. 
"
5,12,Stan,"Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?
"
5,12,Token,"I sure did.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.
"
5,12,Token,"Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart.
"
5,12,Stan,"Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. 
"
5,12,Token,"Here you go. 
"
5,12,Stan,"What's that?
"
5,12,Token,"It's a DVD of the Lion King
"
5,12,Stan,"DVD? We don't own a DVD player.
"
5,12,Kyle,"Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. 
"
5,12,Craig,"Don't you have a VHS of it?
"
5,12,Token,"I only have this.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. 
"
5,12,Token,"What's a VHS?
"
5,12,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, dude. 
"
5,12,Stan,"Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. 
"
5,12,Kyle,"What's a VHS? 
"
5,12,Token,"Why can't I be like all the other kids?
They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns.
And cut-up hot dogs for lunch
It's not my fault my parents succeed so much.
There's no one in town I can relate to.
I play with autographed baseball bats
while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones
Has a boy ever felt so alone?
Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something I'm not
If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got.
If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around,
So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down.
Please, God, send more rich kids...
To my...
Town
"
5,12,Will Smith,"Ooo, look at this, honey.  A beautiful unspoiled town in the Rockies. This is just what we've been looking for!
"
5,12,Jada Pinkett Smith,"""Like Aspen was 30 years ago."" Sounds nice.
"
5,12,Will Smith,"We could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing! And then I could finally live like a cowboy.
"
5,12,Jada Pinkett Smith,"Oh Will, the country would be such a nicer place to raise our kids!
"
5,12,Will Smith,"O kids? 
"
5,12,Older Boy,"Yes, Daddy?
"
5,12,Will Smith,"How would you like to move to the Colorado Rockies?
"
5,12,Older Boy,"The mountains, Daddy?
"
5,12,Girl,"Can we have horses?
"
5,12,Older Boy,"O can we? Can we Daddy?
"
5,12,Will Smith,"You bet!
"
5,12,Kids,"Hooray!
"
5,12,Will Smith,"Well, here it is. Our home to be.
"
5,12,Jada Pinkett Smith,"Oh, Will, it's beautiful.
"
5,12,Token,"Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood!
"
5,12,Will Smith,"Why thank you, young man. We're the Smiths.
"
5,12,Older Boy,"Ah, a local boy. You shall be our new playmate. I'm Frederick. This is my sister Lisa, and my brother Daniel 
"
5,12,Token,"I'm Token.
"
5,12,Lisa,"Our daddy is a very famous actor. What does your daddy do?
"
5,12,Token,"Aah, he's a lawyer. I think.
"
5,12,Will Smith,"How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Token while your mother and I check out the town.
"
5,12,Frederick,"Very well. Come, local boy.  Show us how to play your mountain games.
"
5,12,Token,"All right!  Thanks, God. 
"
5,12,Token,"...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.
"
5,12,Frederick,"Yes, yes, we have one of those, too. In fact, we have seven of them, I believe.
"
5,12,Token,"You do? God, that's great!
"
5,12,Daniel,"Why?
"
5,12,Token,"I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  low to  middle-income.
"
5,12,Lisa,"Why? What happened to all their money?
"
5,12,Token,"Well, they never really had any money.
"
5,12,Lisa,"Well, then, why don't their daddies just act in a movie?
"
5,12,Token,"Well I... think that.. they...
"
5,12,Frederick,"Sometimes children must be very firm with their daddies.
"
5,12,Lisa,"Indeed.
"
5,12,Frederick,"Like when Daddy doesn't want to act in a movie because he thinks the script is bad.
"
5,12,Lisa,"So we must plead with him:  ""Please, Daddy, please! It's twenty million dollard, Daddy.""
"
5,12,Daniel,"""Please, Daddy, please!""
"
5,12,Frederick,"""Twenty million is still twelve million after taxes, Daddy!""
"
5,12,Lisa,"""I want a llama, Daddy!""
"
5,12,Frederick,"""I'd do the picture, Daddy!""
"
5,12,Lisa,"""Please, Daddy!""
"
5,12,Frederick,"""Daddy, please!""
"
5,12,Lisa,"""Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!""
"
5,12,Daniel,"""But Daddy!"" 
"
5,12,Frederick,"And so Daddy does the picture.
"
5,12,Token,"...That's ...great.
"
5,12,Lisa,"Twenty million dollars great.
"
5,12,Snoop Dogg,"I found a girl who had an innie and I felt her with my jimmyPlayer-haters try to do me 'cause my rhymes are just tooo-
"
5,12,Engineer,"Sorry, Snoop Dogg, but Will Smith is on line three for you?
"
5,12,Snoop Dogg,"Oh.  William! How are you buddy?
"
5,12,Will Smith,"Great, Snoop Dogg, and you?
"
5,12,Snoop Dogg,"Couldn't be better. I'm just laying down some vocals for my new album.
"
5,12,Will Smith,"Great, Snoop-Snoop. Listen: Remember how we always talked about wanting to buy property up in the mountains so our kids could ski and ride horses?
"
5,12,Snoop Dogg,"Oho yes, the kids bug me about it all the time.
"
5,12,Will Smith,"Well I found the place, Snooty-roo. It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered, laid-back, and beautiful.
"
5,12,Snoop Dogg,"Ogh. It sounds lovely!
"
5,12,Will Smith,"You really should come give it a look. Jada and I would love for some friends to move here with us.
"
5,12,Snoop Dogg,"I certainly will, William. And perhaps I'll give ol' Maigc and Kobe Bryant a call. They've been looking for vacation properties as well.
"
5,12,Will Smith,"Great! Well, let me let you get back to your recording.
"
5,12,Snoop Dogg,"Hah, see you soon. Bye. 
"
5,12,Will Smith,"Bye. 
"
5,12,Snoop Dogg,"Alright, let's take it from the top, gang. I shout ""Hell Yeah!"" from my vehicle. Livin' is a miracle-
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Look, there's more of them moving into our town.  You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main.
"
5,12,Jimbo,"Yep, there goes the neighborhood. 
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.
"
5,12,Gerald,"Hey! W-what are you saying? What ""types""?
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Yiou know, those types! Rich people! 
"
5,12,Jimbo,"Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.
"
5,12,Ned,"Nnnope.
"
5,12,Jimbo,"I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!
"
5,12,Skeeter,"They're gonna be sending their kids to our schools, and mixin' them with our pure, non-rich kids!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs!
"
5,12,Skeeter,"Damn, I hate those stupid richers!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah.  Hey, rich guy!  Hey, Richie Rich! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, richer! What's in the huge box, richer?! Your checkbook? 
"
5,12,Jimbo,"Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them! 
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers!  Yeah, that's right, cashchucker! Go have fun with your two million dollar house! 
"
5,12,Jimbo,"I guess we showed them!
"
5,12,Oprah Winfrey,"A little to the left. That's great and- Let's put another pool over there.  Uh huh, good. 
"
5,12,Frederick,"Token, these are Oprah's newly-adopted children, Dominique and Zizi.
"
5,12,Dominique and Zizi,"Hello. 
"
5,12,Token,"Hi.
"
5,12,A Boy,"Cheerio!
"
5,12,Frederick,"Ah, and these are Puff Daddy's kids: P Diddy Mini, P Poofy Bite-size, and Poppa Diddy Diddy Puff Fun-size.
"
5,12,Token,"Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding.
"
5,12,Lisa,"Oh no, we're going shopping.
"
5,12,The Kids,"Shopping!
"
5,12,Frederick,"Yes, come Token. We're all going to head down to the mall and buy some of the stores. 
"
5,12,Token,"Oh. Alright then. 
"
5,12,Kobe Bryant,"'Scuse me, can ew get a couple of beers here? 
"
5,12,Skeeter,"They've got nice expensive beers for you across the street at the new Wolfgang Puck's.
"
5,12,Kobe Bryant,"That's alright, we just want some cheap beer tonight. 
"
5,12,Barkeep,"...Maybe you didn't see the sign out front: This bar is for people livin' below their means ONLY!
"
5,12,Men,"Yeah!
"
5,12,Kobe Bryant,"This is a free country. I can have a drink wherever I want.
"
5,12,Man 1,"Come on, Kobe, let's just go.
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here!
"
5,12,Ned,"Nn-what do you mean?
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase ""t""!
"
5,12,Jimbo,"Lowercase ""t""?
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, for ""time to leave""!
"
5,12,Bar Patrons,"Yeah!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase ""t""! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Alright!
"
5,12,Kobe Bryant,"Tee. T- Time to- leave?
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"T is for ""time to leave,"" cashchucker!
"
5,12,Kobe Bryant,"I'm callin' the police. 
"
5,12,Skeeter,"I think we scared 'im.
"
5,12,Jimbo,"Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!
"
5,12,Men,"Yeah!
"
5,12,Frederick,"Now Token, polo is very simple. You simply must hit the williard into some cilium with your fracaman.
"
5,12,Token,"Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms? 
"
5,12,Frederick,"""Can't we play without the uniforms?"" Yes, um. Lert's eat caviar without Bellini's as well!  Now come, Token, and remember: it doesn't matter who wins. It matters who wins three times in a row. Tally ho!
"
5,12,Players,"Tally ho!
"
5,12,Player 1,"Oh!
"
5,12,Player 2,"Yay!
"
5,12,Player 3,"This is exciting.
"
5,12,Player 4,"Oh, Frederick, this is wonderful!
"
5,12,Cartman,"What in the hell are they doing?
"
5,12,Kyle,"Is that fun?
"
5,12,Stan,"I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Well, let's just play our game, then.
"
5,12,Kyle,"Alright.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! 
"
5,12,Kenny,"(Ow!)
"
5,12,Kyle,"I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! 
"
5,12,Stan,"I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman! 
"
5,12,Cartman,"Kick his nutsack! 
"
5,12,Frederick,"You see, you must pay attention, Token. I was able to jollyrow your davishmere with a forecastle.
"
5,12,Token,"This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight?
"
5,12,Player,"A snowball fight?
"
5,12,Lisa,"How barbaric.
"
5,12,Frederick,"Yes, Token, if you want to play such savage games, I suggest you go live with lions. 
"
5,12,Token,"I don't fit in anywhere.
"
5,12,Passenger 1,"Hey! What are you doing? If you're going to ride the bus in South Park, you're gonna have to sit in the FRONT!
"
5,12,Passengers,"Yeah
"
5,12,Passenger 2,"Yeah, that's where the first-class seating is! 
"
5,12,Passenger 1,"Yeah. How do you like that, richer?!
"
5,12,Bill Cosby,"Well it's very nice, actually
"
5,12,Passenger 1,"Yeah, I'll bet it is!
"
5,12,Bill Cosby,"Very, very comfy.
"
5,12,Passenger 1,"Uh huh, looks like it.
"
5,12,Token,"Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you.  So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be.  Uuuh, yeah.
"
5,12,Chef,"Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just- 
"
5,12,Millionaire Protesters,"We shall perservere. We shall perservere.
"
5,12,Oprah Winfrey,"You there, come march with us!
"
5,12,Chef,"For what?
"
5,12,Oprah Winfrey,"All the poor people in town think they can persecute and harass us decent rich folk.
"
5,12,Will Smith,"So we're uniting and marching on the town square!
"
5,12,Kobe Bryant,"The Million Millionaire March!
"
5,12,Millionaire Protesters,"Yeah!
"
5,12,Oprah Winfrey,"Come on, brother! 
"
5,12,Chef,"But... I'm not rich.
"
5,12,Will Smith,"What? 
"
5,12,Chef,"I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.
"
5,12,Will Smith,"We'll give you a hundred dollars.
"
5,12,Chef,"Woo, fudge the snow now. 
"
5,12,Millionaire Protesters,"We shall perservere. We shall perservere.
"
5,12,Chef,"I shall perservere. We shall perservere.
"
5,12,Token,"RRrrr!! 
"
5,12,Girl,"Look at the little black lion, Mommy. 
"
5,12,Mom,"He's cute, isn't he? 
"
5,12,Token,"Roar! 
"
5,12,Lion 1,"What are you doing here, boy?
"
5,12,Token,"You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!
"
5,12,Lion 2,"You're not becoming a lion. The only way you can do that is to see Aslan.
"
5,12,Token,"Who's Aslan?
"
5,12,Lion 1,"Very well, walk this way. 
"
5,12,Aslan,"Is this the boy who's been living in our realm?
"
5,12,Lion 2,"Yes. 
"
5,12,Token,"Are... you... Aslan?
"
5,12,Aslan,"M-I am.
"
5,12,Token,"Well, I'm Token
"
5,12,Aslan,"So, you want to live with the lions, do you?
"
5,12,Token,"Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.
"
5,12,Aslan,"And what makes you think you can fit it with us?
"
5,12,Token,"Well, I don't know.
"
5,12,Aslan,"Do you like jokes?
"
5,12,Token,"What?
"
5,12,Aslan,"Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions love jokes.
"
5,12,Token,"...I like jokes a lot.
"
5,12,Aslan,"Mmm. Then there may be hoipe in you yet, young apprentice lion. Very well. We wihill let you stay, if... you can pull this thorn from my paw.  Go on, try it. Pull my thorn! Come on! Pull my thorm!  Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho! 
"
5,12,Token,"So can I stay?
"
5,12,Aslan,"He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think.
"
5,12,Reporter,"A billion billionaires are gathering their ranks and will be marchng on the town square tonight  in South Park to petition the end of separate bars, bus seating and restaurants. It looks like it will be a great turnout, as some of the millionaires also paid several thousand Mexicans to march for them. 
"
5,12,Skeeter,"If they get that petition passed, it's all over.
"
5,12,Jimbo,"I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?
"
5,12,Skeeter,"They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town.
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything? 
"
5,12,Jimbo,"...Ghosts?
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED!
"
5,12,Men,"Yeah!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll spook 'em out!
"
5,12,Men,"Alright! Yeah! Let's Go! Right!
"
5,12,Token,"Huuuunh  Aslan.
"
5,12,Aslan,"Yes? What is it, young lion apprentice?
"
5,12,Token,"...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.
"
5,12,Aslan,"Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home.
"
5,12,Token,"They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.
"
5,12,Aslan,"It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum?
"
5,12,Token,"...No thanks.
"
5,12,Aslan,"Go on. It's spearmint!
"
5,12,Token,"No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.
"
5,12,Aslan,"Oh. So you don't want any gum then? Are you... sure? Go on, try it!
"
5,12,Token,"Ow. 
"
5,12,Aslan,"That is good stuhuff! 
"
5,12,Token,"Jesus, lions suck!
"
5,12,Will Smith,"And so it is with great determination that us decent rich Americans have gathered to say: ""We will be separated no more!""
"
5,12,Millionaires,"Hooray!
"
5,12,Mayor McDaniels,"This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws.
"
5,12,Millionaires,"Yeah!
"
5,12,Mayor McDaniels,"And I want to assure the nation that is watching that South Park is not a town of prejudice or bigotry.
"
5,12,Voices,"Woooooo!! 
"
5,12,Oprah Winfrey,"What the-?
"
5,12,Mayor McDaniels,"God no. 
"
5,12,Will Smith,"AAAaaahhh! 
"
5,12,Millionaire 1,"Carl, do you see what I see?
"
5,12,Carl,"Yes, Martin. I do believe this town is hainted. 
"
5,12,Will Smith,"Kids! Go find the limo and get in! 
"
5,12,Snoop Dogg,"You didn't tell me this town was hainted!
"
5,12,Will Smith,"I didn't know!  I.. DIDN'T... KNOHOHOHOW... 
"
5,12,Skeeter,"It's working!
"
5,12,Gerald,"They're scared to death!
"
5,12,Millionaire,"Pack up your things quickly! We've got to get out of here! 
"
5,12,Stan,"Oh hey, there's Token. 
"
5,12,Token,"Hey guys.
"
5,12,Stan,"Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
"
5,12,Token,"You mean, you want me around?
"
5,12,Stan,"Sure, dude, you're our friend.
"
5,12,Token,"Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich.
"
5,12,Stan,"Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
"
5,12,Kyle,"Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
"
5,12,Butters,"They sure do.
"
5,12,Stan,"Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
"
5,12,Kyle,"Right.
"
5,12,Token,"That's right, huh?
"
5,12,Kyle,"And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
"
5,12,Stan,"Yeah, I get it for that.
"
5,12,Kyle,"And Cartman for being fat.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Uh huh.
"
5,12,Kyle,"And Cartman for being stupid.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
5,12,Kyle,"And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Hey.
"
5,12,Kyle,"And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole
"
5,12,Cartman,"Ey, you did me already!
"
5,12,Token,"You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich.
"
5,12,Stan,"Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.
"
5,12,Token,"You're not?
"
5,12,Kyle,"No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
"
5,12,Stan,"Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.
"
5,12,Kyle,"Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Pussy. 
"
5,12,Butters,"Heh yeah, later, puss.
"
5,12,Craig,"Ha, that guy's a pussy. 
"
5,12,Token,"Wait! I liked being ripped on for being rich better! 
"
5,12,Skeeter,"That was it. We just saw the last of them speeding away in a van!
"
5,12,Men,"Alright!
"
5,12,Gerald,"They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires!
"
5,12,Men,"What?
"
5,12,Jimbo,"But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.
"
5,12,Randy,"Yeah. You'd become what you hate.
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Well yeah, but at least I got rid of all those damn ni-
"
5,13,Doctor,"Alright, Ms. Sanders, all ready for your abortion? 
"
5,13,Ms. Sanders,"Ready as I'm ever going to be, I guess. 
"
5,13,Doctor,"Well, try to relax; It will all be over very soon. 
"
5,13,Ms. Sanders,"Docter, can we turn off that television? 
"
5,13,Doctor,"Oh yes, I 'm sorry.
Now, there is one more thing.
"
5,13,Ms. Sanders,"What?
"
5,13,Doctor,"Have you heard of stem-cell research?
"
5,13,Ms. Sanders,"Uh-I've heard of it on the news, but... I don't know what it is.
"
5,13,Doctor,"Well basically, a lot of amazing studies have shown that stem cells might be used to fight cancer and a myriad of other diseases. Right now, a lot of stem cells come from the tissue of aborted fetuses-  ah- I'm sorry, unwanted children. And if you sign a release, that tissue can go to studies.
"
5,13,Ms. Sanders,"Oh well, I suppose, if it can help others.
"
5,13,Doctor,"The hope is that someday it might. 
"
5,13,Ms. Sanders,"Well okay. 
Doctor:	Great.  Well, here we go. 
"
5,13,Doctor,"Nurse?  This is to go to Alder's Labs for stem-cell research.
"
5,13,Nurse,"Yes, Doctor.
"
5,13,Truck Driver,"...going places that I've never been
Seeing things that I may never see a- Uuugh!  Jesus Christ!! 
"
5,13,Cartman,"My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm.  What do we have heah? 
"
5,13,Stan,"Well that burned a long time.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Yeah, that was pretty good. 
"
5,13,Stan,"Oh dude, there goes one.
"
5,13,Kyle,"'K go! 
"
5,13,"Stan, Kyle","Alright!
"
5,13,Kenny,"(That's awesome) 
"
5,13,Kyle,"You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
"
5,13,Kenny,"(All right. I'm fine.)
"
5,13,Butters,"Hehehey, fellas! Ah, hey fellas!
"
5,13,Stan,"What, Butters?
"
5,13,Butters,"Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
"
5,13,Stan,"Tell him we're busy.
"
5,13,Butters,"Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
"
5,13,Kyle,"What, did he lose a hundred pounds? 
"
5,13,Butters,"Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah.
"
5,13,Stan,"Alright, let's go see what he wants. 
"
5,13,Butters,"Oh, it's all sticky. 
"
5,13,Kyle,"Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
"
5,13,Stan,"What?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
"
5,13,Kyle,"A trampoline?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Better.
"
5,13,Stan,"A boat?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Better.
"
5,13,Kenny,"(A football machine?)
"
5,13,Cartman,"Better.
"
5,13,Stan,"Well WHAT, Cartman?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes.
"
5,13,Kyle,"...What? 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Mint condition, tax free.
"
5,13,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
"
5,13,Kyle,"I'm leaving right now! 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
"
5,13,Kyle,"You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Stem cells, numbnuts!
"
5,13,Stan,"Stem cells?
"
5,13,Kyle,"Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
"
5,13,Kenny,"(What the fuck are stem cells?)
"
5,13,Kyle,"They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
"
5,13,Cartman,"It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
"
5,13,Kyle,"...I hate you so much. 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.
Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy. 
Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck. 
I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake.  That's a joke  ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.  Damn I'm good. 
"
5,13,Receptionist,"Can I help you?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
"
5,13,Receptionist,"Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very lucky you called. Our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?
"
5,13,Researcher,"This is awful, just awful!
"
5,13,Receptionist,"Oh Larry! This young man has some new fetuses for research.
"
5,13,Cartman,"You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
"
5,13,Larry,"Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now.
"
5,13,Cartman,"...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!
"
5,13,Larry,"I'm afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research.
"
5,13,Receptionist,"A ban? Why?
"
5,13,Larry,"Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! 
"
5,13,Stan,"Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.
"
5,13,Ms. Choksondik,"Alright, class, let's take our seats.  Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office.
"
5,13,Stan,"The principal? Aw, come on!
"
5,13,Kyle,"We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
"
5,13,Ms. Choksondik,"She needs to see you now! 
"
5,13,Kyle,"Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
"
5,13,Principal Victoria,"Hello, boys.
"
5,13,Stan,"Wait. What's going on here? 
"
5,13,Kyle,"Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
"
5,13,Mr. Mackey,"You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat.  Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay.  And well, he's pretty sick. 
"
5,13,Kyle,"Kenny's sick?
"
5,13,Stan,"Well how sick?
"
5,13,Chef,"Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.
"
5,13,Stan,"...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?
"
5,13,Sharon,"Oh dear. 
"
5,13,Stan,"Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.
"
5,13,Sharon,"Randy...
"
5,13,Randy,"They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Wait. Kenny's going to die?
"
5,13,Gerald,"...He might, Kyle.
"
5,13,Stan,"...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.
"
5,13,Mr. Mackey,"We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever.
"
5,13,Stan,"No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.
Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. 
"
5,13,Liane,"Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.
"
5,13,Liane,"They say it's an emergency.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Buh, alright.  eh, Butters?
"
5,13,Butters,"Uh, yeah?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?
"
5,13,Butters,"Eh, just about.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.
"
5,13,Butters,"Oh. Well, uh okay. 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
"
5,13,Butters,"Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
"
5,13,Cartman,"What is this, a PTA meeting? 
"
5,13,Kyle,"Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.
"
5,13,Cartman,"In the ...hospital? Why?
"
5,13,Kyle,"They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Die? Kenny?
"
5,13,Stan,"Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!
"
5,13,Sheila,"I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. 
"
5,13,Doctor,"There we go, little buddy.
"
5,13,Kenny,"(Thank you, Doc.)
"
5,13,Doctor,"You sure you don't wanna take your jacket off; it's pretty warm.
"
5,13,Kenny,"(I'm all right)
"
5,13,Nurse,"Hey, look who has some visitors. 
"
5,13,Doctor,"Hmm, what a lucky little man. We'll be right outside if you need us, Kenny. 
"
5,13,Kyle,"Hey dude, how's it going?
"
5,13,Kenny,"(I'm okay, I guess.)
"
5,13,Cartman,"We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Heh, sorry. 
"
5,13,Kyle,"Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?
"
5,13,Stan,"I- 
"
5,13,Kyle,"Stan?  Stan, where are you going?
"
5,13,Stan,"I can't, I just can't.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Dude, he needs us right now.
"
5,13,Stan,"I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.
"
5,13,Kyle,"I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!
"
5,13,Stan,"And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!
"
5,13,Kyle,"Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
"
5,13,Stan,"Just leave me alone!
"
5,13,Kyle,"Stan, you can't leave!
"
5,13,Stan,"I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! 
"
5,13,Cartman,"...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.
"
5,13,Kenny,"(Eric, well you're my best friend, too.)
"
5,13,Nurse,"Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! 
"
5,13,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? 
"
5,13,Kyle,"Cartman, were you... crying?
"
5,13,Cartman,"' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh.  Oh man.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 
"
5,13,Cartman,"I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.
"
5,13,Larry,"This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?
"
5,13,Larry,"Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a blank cell. Do you understand?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Not at all, but go on. 
"
5,13,Larry,"Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the missing part of the spine.
"
5,13,Cartman,"My God...
"
5,13,Larry,"Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells.
"
5,13,Cartman,"So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.
"
5,13,Larry,"That's the theory.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!
"
5,13,Larry,"Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Hmmm.
"
5,13,Larry,"But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. 
"
5,13,Larry,"Where are you going?
"
5,13,Cartman,"There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.
"
5,13,Larry,"Hey kid.  Give 'em hell. Give 'em hell. 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks. 
"
5,13,Larry,"Oh, hey kid.  Good luck. Good luck. 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. 
"
5,13,Kyle,"...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
"
5,13,Chef,"Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?
"
5,13,Kenny,"(Yes.)  (But what about Stan?)
"
5,13,Kyle,"Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.
"
5,13,Kenny,"(I hope so)
"
5,13,Nurse,"Hey, look who's here.
"
5,13,Kenny,"(Stan??)
"
5,13,Woman,"Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin.
"
5,13,Bob,"We're with the Make-A-Wish Foundation. 
"
5,13,Ms. McCormick,"Oh, Kenny, isn't that nice?
"
5,13,Kenny,"(The Make-A-Wish Foundation?)
"
5,13,Laura,"We travel the country given special little boys and girls like you their biggest wish.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Neat, huh Kenny?
"
5,13,Kenny,"(Yes.)
"
5,13,Laura,"So Kenny, if you could have ONE wish, what would it be? 
"
5,13,Bob,"What's your wish, pal?
"
5,13,Kenny,"(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)
"
5,13,Laura,"What did he say?
"
5,13,Kyle,"He said his wish is not to die. 
"
5,13,Laura,"...O-kay, and, what if you're gonna have two wishes, what would the second one be?
"
5,13,Bob,"I know! I bet you wanna meet Madonna, huh?
"
5,13,Kenny,"(No. Fuckin' Madonna...) 
"
5,13,Bob,"Wu- what was that?
"
5,13,Kyle,"He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 
"
5,13,Madonna,"Should I come in now?
"
5,13,Bob,"Uh no not quite yet.
"
5,13,Chef,"Hello there, children.
"
5,13,Stan,"Hey Chef.
"
5,13,Chef,"How's it goin'?
"
5,13,Stan,"Bad.
"
5,13,Chef,"Yeah. Things have been better.
"
5,13,Stan,"Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?
"
5,13,Chef,"Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.
"
5,13,Stan,"But then, why does God give us anything to start with?
"
5,13,Chef,"Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. 
"
5,13,Stan,"I think I understand.
"
5,13,Cartman,"My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song 
It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
"
5,13,Congressman 1,"One look from you and I would fall from grace.
"
5,13,Congressman 2,"And that would wipe the smile right from my face.
"
5,13,"Congressman 1, Cartman","Do you remember when we used to dance? 
"
5,13,A few Congressmen,"And incidents arose from circumstance? 
"
5,13,Everyone,"One thing led to another; we were young 
And we would scream together songs unsung
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what our hearts meant
The heat of the moment
shone in your eyes
"
5,13,Cartman,"And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs.
"
5,13,Woman,"Oh, I don't know.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.
"
5,13,Jill,"Seventy-five dollars? Well, alright.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Great, just sign right here, please.  Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great.  Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? 
"
5,13,Woman 2,"We're not going to the abortion clinic. I'm going to have this baby.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.
"
5,13,Man,"Oh. Well, I guess we can always... just make another one.
"
5,13,Woman 2,"Oh Mark, I love you.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.
"
5,13,Head nurse,"Young man, do you know where you're going?
"
5,13,Stan,"Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.
"
5,13,Head nurse,"All right! 
"
5,13,Man In Wheelchair,"Go kid! 
"
5,13,Man On Crutches,"Good for you! 
"
5,13,Stan,"Hey, Kenny!  Oh no.  No.
"
5,13,Kyle,"He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
"
5,13,Stan,"But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?
"
5,13,Kyle,"He just said... ""Where's Stan?""
"
5,13,Mr. Garrison,"And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue.
"
5,13,Stan,"I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. 
"
5,13,Cartman,"You guys! Come quick! 
"
5,13,Kyle,"What, Cartman?
"
5,13,Cartman,"It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys! 
"
5,13,Stan,"What, Cartman? What's happened?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's!  It worked! 
"
5,13,Stan,"This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!
"
5,13,Kyle,"I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
"
5,13,Cartman,"I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen.
"
5,13,Kyle,"AAARGH! 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Aah! Kyle!  Kyle! 
"
5,13,Stan,"Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was! 
"
5,14,Butters,"Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
"
5,14,Chris,"Oh, is it someone's anniversary soon? 
"
5,14,Linda,"Oh, you!
"
5,14,Chris,"Just kidding.  Oh, I wonder what it is.
"
5,14,Butters,"It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.
"
5,14,Chris,"Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!
"
5,14,Butters,"Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! 
"
5,14,Linda,"Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.
"
5,14,Butters,"Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
"
5,14,Choir,"Who's the boy that can laugh at a storm cloud?
Turn a frown into a smile for free?
Who's the kid with a heart full of magic?
Everyone knows it's Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me.
"
5,14,Choir,"Who's the boy with the eyes full of wonder?
Who thinks being yourself is the best thing to be?
Who's that rascal with the tweezers in his pocket?
Everyone knows it's Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me.
"
5,14,Choir,"Jumpin' in puddles, skippin' down the hallway
Pettin' at the petting zoo. He loves John Alway.
Who's that tyke with the cutest little dimples,
Battin' his eyes at every puppy he sees?
If you look inside yourself, you might be surprised when you find
A little boy named Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. .
"
5,14,Butters,"Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
"
5,14,Chris,"Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. Linda: I hope he means me, haha. Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.
"
5,14,Chris,"I'll be back in a little bit.  Butters, you're in charge of the house.
"
5,14,Butters,"Yes sir! 
"
5,14,Linda,"Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?
"
5,14,Butters,"We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.
"
5,14,Linda,"Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.
"
5,14,Butters,"Dad's a good shopper all right.
"
5,14,Linda,"Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.
"
5,14,Butters,"You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
"
5,14,Linda,"No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? 
"
5,14,Butters,"Sure I do!
"
5,14,Linda,"Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say?
"
5,14,Butters,"Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am! 
"
5,14,Choir,"Everyone know it's Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, that's me!
"
5,14,Butters,"Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
"
5,14,Butters,"""White Swallow Bath House""
"
5,14,Choir,"Everyone know it's Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, that's me!
"
5,14,Butters,"I'm back, Ma!
"
5,14,Linda,"Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?
"
5,14,Butters,"I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.
"
5,14,Linda,"Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?
"
5,14,Butters,"Well first, he went to see a movie.
"
5,14,Linda,"A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.
"
5,14,Butters,"I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 
"
5,14,Linda,"Wait a minute. What was the movie called?
"
5,14,Butters,"""Fisting Firemen 9""  I've never seen 1 through 8.
"
5,14,Linda,"Oh my God...
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
"
5,14,Linda,"Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?
"
5,14,Butters,"To the gym.
"
5,14,Linda,"To the gym?
"
5,14,Butters,"Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.
"
5,14,Linda,"Gaah!
"
5,14,Butters,"Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
"
5,14,Linda,"...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!
"
5,14,Butters,"Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did you have a nice ""trip,"" Mom? See you next ""fall."" Hahaha, yo- Ma?
"
5,14,Choir,"...Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, that's me!
"
5,14,Linda,"Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint.
"
5,14,Chris,"Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.
"
5,14,Linda,"Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!
"
5,14,Chris,"Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?
"
5,14,Butters,"Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.
"
5,14,Chris,"Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again. 
"
5,14,Linda,"Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint.
"
5,14,Chris,"I'll be back in a little while. 
"
5,14,Butters,"Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?
"
5,14,Linda,"I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again.  Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean. New.
"
5,14,Butters,"Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. 
"
5,14,Linda,"Must clean Butters.  Clean. Never be clean. Must...  kill? The only way? Must kill Butters.  Paaiint.
"
5,14,Choir,"...Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
5,14,Butters,"One please.
"
5,14,Attendant,"Locker two thirteen! 
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh thanks! 
"
5,14,Butters,"Dad?  Dad, you in here?
"
5,14,Butters,"Hello? Eh-anybody in here?
"
5,14,Man,"There, do you think that works?
"
5,14,Mr. Garrison,"Well, that's four fingers; try five.
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, Mr. Garrison?
"
5,14,Mr. Garrison,"...Who is that?!
"
5,14,Butters,"Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?
"
5,14,Mr. Slave,"This room's taken.
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm. 
"
5,14,Chris,"OOH! BUTTERS!
"
5,14,Butters,"Hi Dad! 
"
5,14,Chris,"Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!
"
5,14,Butters,"I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
"
5,14,Chris,"Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you.
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. 
"
5,14,Chris,"Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?
"
5,14,Choir,"Everyone knows it's Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
5,14,Chris,"Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, hey Dad.
"
5,14,Chris,"Come here, son.  I wanna have a talk with you.
"
5,14,Butters,"Well, sure thing, Dad.
"
5,14,Chris,"Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.
"
5,14,Butters,"Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
"
5,14,Chris,"Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called ""little white lies.""
"
5,14,Butters,"Little white lies?
"
5,14,Chris,"You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.
"
5,14,Butters,"...Uh, who's Jack?
"
5,14,Chris,"Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane.
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.
"
5,14,Chris,"It won't? Oh, good.
"
5,14,Butters,"Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
"
5,14,Chris,"You... what?
"
5,14,Linda,"Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.
"
5,14,Butters,"A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?
"
5,14,Linda,"No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.
"
5,14,Butters,"Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
"
5,14,Linda,"Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?
"
5,14,Butters,"Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
"
5,14,Linda,"And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' ""nutsack"" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
"
5,14,Linda,"If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.
"
5,14,Butters,"Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.
"
5,14,Linda,"I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters.  I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.
"
5,14,Linda,"Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.
"
5,14,Butters,"Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! 
"
5,14,Choir,"Everyone knows it's Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
5,14,Linda,"""Dear bastard husband,"" No.  ""Dear lying sonofabitch,"" No.  ""Dear assface,"" Yeah, that's it. ""I will no longer-""
"
5,14,Chris,"Linda?? What are you doing?? 
"
5,14,Linda,"Stay away from me, bastard!
"
5,14,Chris,"Linda, I know this is very hard-
"
5,14,Linda,"You don't know anything!
"
5,14,Chris,"I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!
"
5,14,Linda,"Then why, Chris, why?!
"
5,14,Chris,"It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!
"
5,14,Linda,"Well,  you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! 
"
5,14,Chris,"No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you.  We can have a normal life!
"
5,14,Linda,"There is no going back, Chris!
"
5,14,Chris,"Sure there is!
"
5,14,Linda,"No!  Our son is dead!
"
5,14,Chris,"What?
"
5,14,Linda,"I killed him.  I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!
"
5,14,Chris,"Oh no.  No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?
"
5,14,Linda,"I WASN'T THINKING!  I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you!  Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- 
"
5,14,Chris,"This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.
"
5,14,Linda,"Just go away and let me die! 
"
5,14,Chris,"No! Linda, we-
"
5,14,Linda,"I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! 
"
5,14,Chris,"Linda, Butters is gone.  Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! 
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
5,14,News 4 Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in front of the home of Chris and Linda Stotch. They're living every parent's nightmare right now, as last night, while Ms. Stotch was driving with her son in the car, a man stopped her, put a gun to her head, and took her son away. When asked who the man was, Ms. Stotch replied, ""Some Puerto Rican guy."" Naturally, the police are in an all-out manhunt for Some Puerto Rican Guy.  Uh, it looks like the parents are about to make a statement, Tom. 
"
5,14,Reporter 1,"Mrs. Stotch? Mrs. Stotch? Any word yet from the man who took your son?
"
5,14,Linda,"No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us.
"
5,14,News 4 Reporter,"Mrs. Stotch, what did the kidnapper look like?
"
5,14,Linda,"Puerto Rican.
"
5,14,Reporter 2,"Was he tall? Short?
"
5,14,Linda,"He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me.
"
5,14,Choir,"...Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
5,14,Butters,"And so them my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' ""you took my rubber bands."" Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister.
"
5,14,Truck Driver,"Yeah. Too bad you're not a broad, 'cause I need some God-damned poontang.
"
5,14,Butters,"Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk?  He must like TGI Fridays.
"
5,14,Police Chief,"Let us handle it.  Barbrady?
"
5,14,Barbrady,"Hello?
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this?
"
5,14,Barbrady,"Who is this?
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, is this the Stotch residence?
"
5,14,Barbrady,"Yes. Are you calling about the abduction?
"
5,14,Butters,"...No.
"
5,14,Barbrady,"Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican?
"
5,14,Butters,"...No.
"
5,14,Barbrady,"We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day.  It wasn't the abductors, sorry.
"
5,14,Officer 1,"Chief! Two more parents from the next town over have shown up saying their child might have been killed by the same guy that took the Stotch boy.
"
5,14,Police Chief,"Really?
"
5,14,Officer 2,"This is John and Patsy Ramsey, from Boulder.
"
5,14,John Ramsey,"We saw your story on the news, and we were so sorry to hear about your loss.
"
5,14,Patsy Ramsey,"Our daughter was killed a few years ago, in our house.
"
5,14,Linda,"Yes, I... remember hearing something about that.
"
5,14,John Ramsey,"A and we realized... The man that murdered your son must be the same person that killed our daughter!
"
5,14,Patsy Ramsey,"Yes, because we certainly didn't do it! No. 
"
5,14,John Ramsey,"No, huh.
"
5,14,Patsy Ramsey,"No.
"
5,14,Chris,"Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't know that he's dead yet.
"
5,14,The Ramseys,"Riiight.
"
5,14,Choir,"...Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
5,14,Butters,"Sir? Hello?
"
5,14,Mechanic,"Hallo, what can I do for ya?
"
5,14,Butters,"Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.
"
5,14,Mechanic,"Sarrih, wife took the car to Estes Park for the weekend. Won't be back until Sunday, hyeah. I can give you a ride Sunday, if ya like.
"
5,14,Butters,"I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
"
5,14,Mechanic,"Well, then, looks like you're walkin'.
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? 
"
5,14,Mechanic,"'Aht road leads to Conifuh. You want to go to South Park, you gotta go down that rod.  'Course, I ain't nevuh seen anyone go up that rod. Six years ago a group of campers went up there and got lost. Had to eat each other to say alive. Used to be the way to O'Riley house. He butchered over fifty children and kept their bodies in a cellah. But, you should find an old bridge about halfway up. That bridge is cursed, you know? They built it with the bones of two hundred Chinese laborers who were massacred in '34. Yeah. Lotta history down that rod.
"
5,14,Butters,"...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.
"
5,14,Mechanic,"Well, uh good luck then.
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh jeez. 
"
5,14,Mechanic,"...or is South Park down that rod?
"
5,14,John Ramsey,"It's so very hard to lose a loved one, isn't it?
"
5,14,Chris,"Yes, it, it sure is.
"
5,14,Patsy Ramsey,"Thank goodness we have each other to share our grief.
"
5,14,Linda,"Thank goodness.
"
5,14,John Ramsey,"Here he is. 
"
5,14,A Politician,"John! Patsy!
"
5,14,John Ramsey,"Hello, Gary. Great to see you. Chris and Linda, this is our good friend, Congressman Gary Condit.  He also lost someone close to him and thinks it something to do with the same Puerto Rican guy that hurt our kids.
"
5,14,Gary Condit,"We're goin' tuh get that sonofabitch! 
"
5,14,Chris,"Yes, I'd I sure hope we do.
"
5,14,Gary Condit,"I spoke with the FBI and Some Puerto Rican Guy has just made their Number One Most Wanted, heh.
"
5,14,Patsy Ramsey,"Oh, good. Maybe now they'll catch him.  Oh, here's another member of our support group.  O.J.
"
5,14,O.J. Simpson,"Hey guys.
"
5,14,Gary Condit,"Chris, Linda, you know O.J. Simpson. 
"
5,14,Linda,"Oh. Sure.
"
5,14,Patsy Ramsey,"O.J.'s wife was killed by an uh, Some Puerto Rican Guy, too.
"
5,14,O.J. Simpson,"Yup, it was Some Puerto Rican Guy all right.
"
5,14,John Ramsey,"So you see, Chris and Linda, there are people like you all over the country who've been affected by Some Puerto Rican Guy.
"
5,14,Gary Condit,"Hey! Let's make Chris and Linda an official part of the group.
"
5,14,John Ramsey,"Yeah!

You'll love all our... shenanigans.
Oh, nutsack  Oops.
&lt;/poem&gt;
"
5,14,Choir,"Everyone knows it's Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
5,14,Chris,"Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican!  You have to learn to keep it straight!
"
5,14,Linda,"I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!
"
5,14,Chris,"Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! 
"
5,14,Linda,"Don't forget: your lies started all this. 
"
5,14,Chris,"My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! 
"
5,14,Butters,"Happy Anniversary!
"
5,14,Chris,"Not now, Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh.  Alright, then. I-
"
5,14,Linda,"Butters?? Oh, Butters!
"
5,14,Chris,"Son! I don't believe it! 
"
5,14,Butters,"Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
"
5,14,Linda,"Oh, my baby's back!
"
5,14,Butters,"I ain't grounded, am I?
"
5,14,Chris,"No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why...  Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?
"
5,14,Butters,"Lie?
"
5,14,Linda,"Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.
"
5,14,Chris,"No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! 
"
5,14,Linda,"Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!
"
5,14,Butters,"Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.
"
5,14,Chris,"Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!
"
5,14,Linda,"You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.
"
5,14,Chris,"Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!
"
5,14,Butters,"Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here  with you two! 
"
5,14,Chris,"...Butters... You're as right as rain.
"
5,14,Linda,"You sure are.
"
5,14,Butters,"Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
"
5,14,Linda,"No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world.  And I am so happy you're alive.
"
5,14,Butters,"...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
"
5,14,Chris,"You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. 
"
5,14,Chris,"We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. 
"
5,14,Man in Crowd,"Wow, alright
"
5,14,Stan,"Butters was missing?
"
5,14,Chris,"But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.
"
5,14,Butters,"Yeah!
"
5,14,Linda,"We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
"
5,14,Butters,"Yeah!

5,14,Chris,"You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.
"
5,14,Butters,"Ye-!  wait, what?
"
5,14,Cartman,"Huho!
"
5,14,Linda,"And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!
"
5,14,Stan,"Damn, dude.
"
5,14,Chris,"So you see, there was no ""Some Puerto Rican Guy."" He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, ""You're a liar! You're a LIAR!""  ""You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!""  Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, ""Hello,"" but they'd be thinking, ""Ah, there goes that MURDERER!""  ""You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!""  And to me, people might say things like,  ""LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!""  And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like,  ""You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!""  ""CONFESS!""  ""LIAR! CONFESS!""  You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.
"
5,14,Linda,"We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
"
5,14,Chris,"And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.
"
5,14,Man 2 in Crowd,"Yeah-ah-alright! 
"
5,14,Stan,"Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
"
5,14,Butters,"Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
"
5,14,Cartman,"We sure are.
"
5,14,Butters,"I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
"
5,14,Stan,"Really?
"
5,14,Butters,"Naw, I'm lyin'
"
5,14,Chris,"Let's go, son.
"
5,14,Butters,"Wuh comin', Dad! 
"
5,14,Choir,"Everyone knows it's Butters!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
