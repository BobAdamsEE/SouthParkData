17,1,Kyle,"I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!
"
17,1,Cartman,"Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.
"
17,1,Lawrence,"How many hours were you guys playing?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like ""Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!""
"
17,1,Kyle,"AAAARGH!
"
17,1,Lawrence,"You were playing football?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Yeah, but I was like ""I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle."" In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
"
17,1,Kyle,"That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
"
17,1,Cartman,"Kyle, this is a private conversation.
"
17,1,Kyle,"Then take that shit off speaker phone!!
"
17,1,Lawrence,"Is that that same kid?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
"
17,1,Kyle,"How do we have a choice?!
"
17,1,Cartman,"Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
"
17,1,Lawrence,"Yeah yeah, you said that.
"
17,1,Toby,"My dad says the government keeps a database on everyone.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Who is that? Is that Toby
"
17,1,Toby,"Yeah.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
"
17,1,Toby,"Yeah, we're ditching school.
"
17,1,Cartman,"You're what? What, you say?
"
17,1,Lawrence,"Me and Toby are ditching school!
"
17,1,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read ""1984""?
"
17,1,Lawrence,"I don't think so.
"
17,1,Cartman,"See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! 
"
17,1,Lawrence,"That'd be cool.
"
17,1,Cartman,"That'd be what?
"
17,1,Lawrence,"That'd be COOL.
"
17,1,Cartman,"I know, right?  A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.  I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?  Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my ""Stop Listening To Me"" Web site.  What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!  You guys gonna update your blogs too?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?
"
17,1,Lawrence,"I said I got your tweet and the address!
"
17,1,Cartman,"Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
"
17,1,Toby,"Yeah, I'm here, bro.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. 
"
17,1,Kyle,"Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school
"
17,1,Butters,"Ww-ww-what's the N S A?
"
17,1,Cartman,"That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? 
"
17,1,Butters,"The government watches everything we do?
"
17,1,Butters,"Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
"
17,1,Cartman,"Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
"
17,1,Lawrence,"They're spying on you?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, ""you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek."" I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!  This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!
"
17,1,Lawrence,"Like what?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
"
17,1,Lawrence,"Naw, don't do that.
"
17,1,Cartman,"No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-  Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.  I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.
"
17,1,Lawrence,"You need that new thing where you don't need to type.
"
17,1,Cartman,"What, they already have something better than Twitter?
"
17,1,Lawrence,"You haven't seen the Alec Baldwin commercial?
"
17,1,Cartman,"No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
"
17,1,Alec Baldwin,"Hello. I'm Alec Baldwin, and I love social media.  But sometimes, I accidentally tweet things that are homophobic. I don't think that way, I just type that way. That's when I realized it wasn't me that was homophobic, it was my thumbs, and they needed to be gotten rid of.  So then the problem was, I don't have thumbs. But I know that everyone in America still wants to hear everything I have to say. Well, that's okay, because now there's a device that can actually take the thoughts in your head and send them directly to the Internet. It's called... Shitter. Wires are grafted harmlessly into your skull and any thought you have is uploaded to the Internet, and on to all your Shitter followers.  Don't let your social media slow down our need to communicate with the world. Go direct from thought to Internet ...with Shitter. 
"
17,1,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
17,1,Clyde,"What's Shitter?
"
17,1,Stan,"Wow.
"
17,1,Kyle,"You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.
"
17,1,Clyde,"How many people are on Shitter?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
"
17,1,Butters,"Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 
"
17,1,Clerk,"Next!
"
17,1,Butters,"Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, ""If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness."" Are these people nice?
"
17,1,Man,"DMV people? They're the meanest people on planet Earth.
"
17,1,Butters,"Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was ""Pink"" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! ""Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!""  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang ""My Country Tis Of Thee"" 100 times! And I watches ""America's Got Talent"" twice! What else can I do?
"
17,1,Clerk,"Why not a thousand ""Livin' In America""s?
"
17,1,Butters,"Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
"
17,1,Receptionist,"Can I help you sir?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
"
17,1,Receptionist,"All right, and your name?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Bill Clinton.
"
17,1,Receptionist,"I don't see you on the list, Mr. Clinton.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
"
17,1,Chief,"What have you got, Patricia?
"
17,1,Patricia,"Uh, this man says he has an interview for a job, sir?
"
17,1,Cartman,"I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
"
17,1,Cartman,"I was um, sure that the appointment was today.
"
17,1,Chief,"That's quite alright. The NSA needs all the help it can get. Come on upstairs and I'll show you around, see if you're fit for the job.
"
17,1,Pamphleteer,"Hello sir. My colleague and I are going through the neighborhood and seeing if you'd like to know the Truth. 
"
17,1,Butters,"Sure, I love the Truth.
"
17,1,Pamphleteer,"Okay, we from uh Jehovah Witness. We Kingdom Hall Jehovah Witness, and uh, we believe, sir, that uh many people interpret the Bible it wrong.
"
17,1,Butters,"Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.
"
17,1,Pamphleteer,"We are, sir. We believe the, the Truth. I was once like you. I knew not what to believe, then I let my pulvy the Jehovah into the heart.
"
17,1,Butters,"Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
"
17,1,Pamphleteer,"Yes, because uh Jehovah will bring judgement against all who perish like the little girl will burn in fire.
"
17,1,Butters,"Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
"
17,1,Pamphleteer,"The government ih watching me?
"
17,1,Colleague,"Wansa?
"
17,1,Pamphleteer,"He said the government ih watching us. 
"
17,1,Colleague,"Hi now?
"
17,1,Pamphleteer,"How long they been watching us?
"
17,1,Butters,"Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
"
17,1,Pamphleteer,"I don't go to DMV. I don't have car.
"
17,1,Butters,"Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 
"
17,1,Chief,"Right this way, Bill. Welcome to the NSA main office.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
"
17,1,Chief,"There's a lot of people working here at the NSA. Good people, people who just wanna keep America safe. Only problem is, checking all those e-mails, Twitter accounts, and surveilling all those phone calls can take a lot of manpower. 
"
17,1,Detective,"Hey Joe?
"
17,1,Joe,"Whatchoo got, Miller.
"
17,1,Miller,"Got a 24-year-old male in Albuquerque. He just e-mailed his wife and asked if she could go to the store after work. Then he called the fitness center to set up a membership. He liked the fitness center, so he tweeted his friends that they should try it out.
"
17,1,Joe,"...Alright, keep an eye on them. Let me know if anything changes. 
"
17,1,Miller,"Will do.
"
17,1,Joe,"It's a never-ending grind here at the NSA, and it seems there's never enough detectives to keep track of everyone.  Sergeant! What have you got, Larson.
"
17,1,Larson,"Got a seventeen-year-old female down in Jacksonville. She called her friend and asked her if she wanted to see the Percy Jackson movie. Then she e-mailed her mom at work and asked if it was okay. The mom said yes, but called her husband first to make sure there weren't any dinner plans.
"
17,1,Joe,"Alright, keep an eye on all three of them.
"
17,1,Larson,"Will do. 
"
17,1,Joe,"If you think you got the stomach for this, then we can definitely use your help, young man.
"
17,1,Detective,"Sir, you might wanna check this out.
"
17,1,Joe,"What have you got?
"
17,1,Detective,"Thirty-two-year-old pizza delivery man. He just put it on his Twitter account that he hates America and wants to blow up the Lincoln Memorial. 
"
17,1,Hippie,"Well well, the NSA. I should've known.
"
17,1,Joe,"We wanna talk to you about some tweets you've been tweeting.
"
17,1,Hippie,"Hey man, I was just blowin' smoke. Say, what right does the government have reading my private e-mails anyway?! Haven't you squares heard of the Constitution?
"
17,1,Joe,"Yeah, we've heard of that. We've also heard of the Declaration of Independence. See, there's a lot of people out there who think like you, people who think their government doesn't have the right to go around poking their noses in the e-mails of its citizens. That is, until a plane flies into a couple of towers and a little girl loses her life. You wanna live in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, but the brave can't be free if the land isn't home, and that land won't be home so long as folks out there wanna take that American flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week, and as you're sittin' there on the toilet with the Star-Spangled Montezuma's Revenge there's one thing I can guarantee you.
"
17,1,Hippie,"Yeah? What's that?
"
17,1,Joe,"You won't care who's checkin' your Twitter account then. 
"
17,1,Hippie,"...I never thought of it that way.
"
17,1,Terrance,"Hey Phillip! Pull my finger!  Aaaahahahaha. 
"
17,1,Butters,"Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
17,1,Craig,"...The truth about what?
"
17,1,Butters,"We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
"
17,1,Craig,"...Aahhhh, no, I don't think so.
"
17,1,Pamphleteer,"My colleague and I, we went to saaah experience at DMV. We went to DMV, we admit all our shortcomings an sins and uh make a tital wave of peace and serenity with the truth stored inside our heart.
"
17,1,Craig,"...Okay. 
"
17,1,Butters,"You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
"
17,1,Craig,"Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no.
"
17,1,Butters,"Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?
"
17,1,Craig,"Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.
"
17,1,Butters,"Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
"
17,1,Craig,"I have no idea.
"
17,1,Butters,"Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
"
17,1,Pamphleteer,"Yes sir.  See, i used to be like you. I go around sending them nasty e-mails and a nasty texts, puttin' nasty picture on my nasty Facebook. But then I realized, all these things, they live forever, because the government keep a file on us. So all that live forever up in what they call the Clou'. It's a government term. If they could put a file in the Clou', then I wanna make sure I come clean about the bad ones and maybe get those things off my record off the Clou'. Because we all live forever in the Clou'.
"
17,1,Butters,"Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
"
17,1,Date,"What is that voice?
"
17,1,Alec Baldwin,"Some little faggot in my head.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
"
17,1,Detective 3,"Pretty simple. Everyone has a file. People who have a status of ""threat"", ""possible threat"", or ""person of interest"" are the ones we really wanna look at.
"
17,1,Detective 4,"The more we pay attention to them, the bigger their file becomes.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Really? How big is my file?
"
17,1,Detective 4,"Huh?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
"
17,1,Detective 3,"Jarvis, what have we got on an ""Eric Cartman""? Any files on Eric Cartman.
"
17,1,Jarvis,"Ohhh yeah, we tracked him for a little bit, but Central Computer designated his status as ""fat and unimportant.""
"
17,1,Cartman,"Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to ""ripped and sweet.""  'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!
"
17,1,Barbrady,"And that's when I masturbated to Game of Thrones. I know it was wrong to masturbate, and I know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty.
"
17,1,Clerk 2,"What the?  Why do these people keep coming here?
"
17,1,Barbrady,"But I am done forever with Game of Thrones. Forever
"
17,1,Clerk 2,"Next, please! 
"
17,1,Barbrady,"Thank you. 
"
17,1,Group,"Yaaaaaay.
"
17,1,Butters,"Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?
"
17,1,Barbrady,"I, I feel really good.
"
17,1,Group,"Heehhhhhhhah. 
"
17,1,Customer,"Wow, those people over there seem like they're havin' fun. 
"
17,1,Butters,"I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
"
17,1,Group,"To the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
"
17,1,Larry,"What the hell is going on here?! This is the DMV! There will be no joy here!
"
17,1,Clerk 3,"Uh people keep showing up and telling us what they did wrong.
"
17,1,Customer 2,"Hey, I'm just trying to renew my license. How much longer do I gotta wait? 
"
17,1,Larry,"Shut up! Sit there and wait, and no cell phones or other things that pass time joyously! I'll put a stop to this! 
"
17,1,Cartman,"Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
"
17,1,Chief Joe,"Not according to the Central Computer.
"
17,1,Cartman,"The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
"
17,1,Chief Joe,"Sorry,  but if Central Computer says he is not a threat, then we can't do anything. 
"
17,1,Cartman,"Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!
"
17,1,Chief Joe,"There's 300 million people out there. How do you think we're able to keep track of every single person in the country? How do you think we're able to really know who's doing what?
"
17,1,Cartman,"I don't know.
"
17,1,Chief Joe,"Alright, I'll show you. But this is very top security stuff, because if people knew how we did it, then everyone would do it. Then our enemies would do it. We can't let our enemies get their hands on this.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Get their hands on what?  Dude... 
"
17,1,Chief Joe,"This is how we know who's a threat and who's not. How we know who's sleeping and who's awake.  How we know that...
"
17,1,Cartman,"You think I'm fat and unimportant now?!  I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!
"
17,1,Alec Baldwin,"Hi everybody, and welcome to my new show on MSNBC, ""Free Pass with Alec Baldwin""
"
17,1,Cartman,"You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
"
17,1,Liane,"Eric, honey, what's the matter?
"
17,1,Cartman,"It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!
"
17,1,Liane,"I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! 
"
17,1,Liane,"Honey, it's okay.
"
17,1,Cartman,"It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! 
"
17,1,Liane,"No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.
"
17,1,Cartman,"I do toooo!
"
17,1,Liane,"No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
"
17,1,Liane,"Okay, hon.
"
17,1,Butters,"Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
17,1,Cartman,"...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?
"
17,1,Butters,"It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
"
17,1,Cartman,"It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
"
17,1,Butters,"It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
"
17,1,Cartman,"What's this?
"
17,1,Butters,"Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
"
17,1,Cartman,"I can be forgiven?
"
17,1,Butters,"Yes.
"
17,1,Cartman,"For everything bad I've ever done?
"
17,1,Butters,"Yes!
"
17,1,Cartman,"And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
"
17,1,Butters,"That's right.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Thta's pretty kewl.
"
17,1,Butters,"We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
"
17,1,Cartman,"I do, I love my country!
"
17,1,Butters,"Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
"
17,1,Cartman,"I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
"
17,1,Butters,"Hallelujah!
"
17,1,Group,"Yaaaaay!
"
17,1,Paul,"Do you want us to kick them out of here, Lar?
"
17,1,Larry,"No... No, leave them alone. It's a nice change to see people happy here at the DMV.  Perhaps we here at the DMV can start changing as well. Perhaps instead of treating people badly we can offer them comfort and hope. Why, the DMV can be a place where people come to get things off their chests. Confess, yes, but also be told that they're worth something in this world! And then, DMVs everywhere can become a place where people feel safe. And when they do something wrong we can offer forgiveness! Don't you see what this could lead to? Don't you see what we could become??
"
17,1,News Anchor,"The DMV was shut down today after rampant allegations of sex with young boys.  The heads of the DMV were arrested and the director stated, quote: Hey, it came with the territory. With the DMV shut down, Americans have been asked to confess all wrongdoings at their nearest post office.  We've just received word that the US Postal service has been shut down due to rampant allegations of sex with young boys. It now appears that the only people who can be trusted with confessions and guidance is your local news station. WMZ News will be back in... a young boy.
"
17,2,Wendy,"Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-
"
17,2,Cartman,"Boooo!  Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!
"
17,2,Wendy,"Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
"
17,2,Cartman,"Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.
"
17,2,Wendy,"The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-
"
17,2,Cartman,"Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!  Boo Wendy! Liar!
"
17,2,Wendy,"Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!
"
17,2,Cartman,"I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
"
17,2,Wendy,"Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please?  Mr. Garrison?!
"
17,2,Mr. Garrison,"Huh? Oh, oh, Wendy, uhhh, very nicely done. Thank you. Okay, next report,  let's have uh, Peter Mullen.
"
17,2,Wendy,"Ugh, Jesus! 
"
17,2,Peter,"My report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television. Fellow students: there is a plague of smut on our cable boxes!  Shows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicide!  I'm talking of course about  murder porn!
"
17,2,Butters,"Murder porn?
"
17,2,Cartman,"That's more like it.
"
17,2,Peter,"According to the Nielsen ratings, viewership in shows like ""Cold Case Files,"" ""Dateline: Murder,"" and ""Deadly Affairs"" is skyrocketing amongst married couples. The increased viewership has brought about a whole new slew of shows that use graphic sex, and innuendo, to make spousal murder more titillating. Shows like ""Southern Fried Homicide,"" ""Sinful Secrets,"" ""On The Case with Paula Zahn."" And it's all smut and it's garbage and it's  trash!  Your parents are watching this stuff! Go home and ask them! And as we ask them we must also ask ourselves, ""If they're obsessed with this stuff, then how long? How long before one of our daddies dresses up in lingerie and bashes Mommy's head in with a brick?"" 
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  Come on it.  Oh hey Stan, what's up? 
"
17,2,Narrator,"His wife is having sex with the neighbor.  And when her husband comes home,  he wants more than just a divorce. 
"
17,2,Stan,"You guys are watchin' murder porn?
"
17,2,Randy,"...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
"
17,2,Sharon,"Uh adults like documentaries.
"
17,2,Randy,"Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.
"
17,2,Stan,"Okaaay. 
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
"
17,2,Stan,"What's up dude?
"
17,2,Cartman,"Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?
"
17,2,Stan,"Yhh, yeah, the first grader?
"
17,2,Cartman,"You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
"
17,2,Stan,"...What?!
"
17,2,Sergeant Yates,"Hey that kid should not be seeing this! 
"
17,2,Stan,"What happened?
"
17,2,Dad,"You're making a mistake!  Let me go! It wasn't me, I tell ya! A burglar broke in! He was black! He's the one who stabbed that nagging bitch in her fat face! He was blaaack! 
"
17,2,Kyle,"Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
"
17,2,Red,"How is this stuff allowed to stay on the air?!
"
17,2,Clyde,"The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
"
17,2,Butters,"I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
"
17,2,Wendy,"This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
"
17,2,Cartman,"Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
"
17,2,Kyle,"Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.
"
17,2,Narrator,"Tonight at 10, it's a tale of lust, seduction, and murder, on Sexy Betrayals.  Then at 7, some like their murder with a side of sexy biscuits,  on Southern Fried Homicide. But now, get ready for lust, betrayal and murder,  on Hot Load Case Files. 
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh yeah!  Three of the best shows in a row!
"
17,2,Sharon,"Is the lube over there?
"
17,2,Randy,"Yeah, I got lube right here.
"
17,2,Sharon,"Well get over here, big guy.
"
17,2,Randy,"Yeah-hah! 
"
17,2,Randy,"What the?  What the hell?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says ""How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?"" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?
"
17,2,Randy,"Stan. Stan!  How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?
"
17,2,Stan,"What?
"
17,2,Randy,"What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
"
17,2,Stan,"You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. 
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!  I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot!  Stan?  You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! 
"
17,2,Stephen,"Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!
"
17,2,Mrs. Tweak,"How are they able to do this with their smartphones?
"
17,2,Randy,"It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!  What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?
"
17,2,Stuart,"No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.
"
17,2,Randy,"What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"I'm sorry sir. If you need it now, perhaps you should switch to another cable company.  Ohhh there's not another cable company, is there?  Ohhh, that's right, we're the only one in town.
"
17,2,Randy,"Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"As we told the others, sir, we can fix it. We just need to send a technician out to your house to change out your cable box.
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh. Well okay, great.
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"We'll just need to find a window of time you can be home... How about between the hours of 6 am and 3 pm all of November?
"
17,2,Randy,"NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"Oh, you can't?  Jeez that's too bad. You need to be home for the technician. Have you thought of switching to DirecTV?
"
17,2,Randy,"I can't afford DirecTV.
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"Oh, you can't?  Jeez, that's terrible. Then I guess you just have to work within our time windows. 
"
17,2,Stephen,"Well? Any luck?
"
17,2,Randy,"No, just the usual cable-company stuff.
"
17,2,Mrs. Tweak,"Oh well, guess we'll just have to live without our informative crime drama.
"
17,2,Stephen,"No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?
"
17,2,Randy,"I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.
"
17,2,Stephen,"We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price.
"
17,2,Boy,"Hello?
"
17,2,Randy,"Hi. Corey Lanskin?
"
17,2,Corey,"Yes?
"
17,2,Randy,"We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
"
17,2,Corey,"Fuck off! 
"
17,2,Randy,"Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!
"
17,2,Corey,"You was told wrong, mistuh! I'm just a simple kid with a simple passion for simple things!
"
17,2,Randy,"We have a hundred ounces of silver. 
"
17,2,Corey,"Wipe your feet and turn off your cell phones. 
"
17,2,Corey,"Next we're going to select an empty world. Selecting an empty world will begin with you being dropped onto a beach. Now you're free to roam around and start punching trees!
"
17,2,Gerald,"Punching trees?
"
17,2,Randy,"Why, why would we punch trees?
"
17,2,Corey,"Just use your fucking brain! How do you get wood?  'Ow do you get wood?!
"
17,2,Randy,"Watching informative murder porn?
"
17,2,Corey,"NOO NOO, in this Minecraft forest, how do you get wood?!
"
17,2,Randy,"Puh, punching trees?
"
17,2,Corey,"Riiight. You punch the trees to get the wood, you get the wood to build a cabin.
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh, I see. So when does the game start?
"
17,2,Corey,"You are playing the game; this is the game!
"
17,2,Randy,"...I don't get it.
"
17,2,Corey,"That's because you're thinkin' like a dad. Minecraft, it don't got no winner. It don't got no objective. You just fuckin' build an' shit. And seein' if other things can come and knock it down. Now, let's click on the inventory, and let's filter through the skin!
"
17,2,Randy,"Yes ah, I'm getting it now.
"
17,2,Gerald,"You are?
"
17,2,Randy,"No.
"
17,2,Sharon,"Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.
"
17,2,Randy,"I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.
"
17,2,Sharon,"I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
"
17,2,Randy,"Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.
"
17,2,Sharon,"We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
"
17,2,Randy,"No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?
"
17,2,Sharon,"Well I'm going to sleep, Randy.
"
17,2,Randy,"Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.
"
17,2,Jimmy,"There he is. Hey Kyle!  The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.
"
17,2,Kyle,"What? How do you know?
"
17,2,Tweek,"I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!
"
17,2,Craig,"It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
"
17,2,Stan,"That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
"
17,2,Cartman,"You guys?  You guys, you'd better get over here.
"
17,2,Stan,"What?
"
17,2,Cartman,"Butters' dad killed his mom. 
"
17,2,Stan,"Butters, what happened?
"
17,2,Butters,"I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled ""Hey, watch out for the Creepers!"" but she fell!
"
17,2,Stan,"Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?
"
17,2,Butters,"Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
"
17,2,Mr. Mackey,"Butters, your dad threw you down a well?
"
17,2,Stan,"In Minecraft.
"
17,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well what the hell is that?
"
17,2,Butters,"I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
"
17,2,Kyle,"That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
"
17,2,Stan,"Whattaya mean?
"
17,2,Kyle,"Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. 
"
17,2,Randy,"Yes?
"
17,2,Officer 1,"Hello sir, had a little incident last night, wondering if you saw or heard anything?
"
17,2,Randy,"No, what happened?
"
17,2,Officer 1,"Well, someone broke into your next door neighbor's back yard and they... dug up a bunch of holes and punched his trees.
"
17,2,Randy,"Punched his trees, huh?
"
17,2,Officer 1,"Yes sir. Then we got a house across the street where someone dug up the yard and... built a cabin.
"
17,2,Randy,"Huh.  That's weird.
"
17,2,Officer 1,"What were you doing last night?
"
17,2,Randy,"I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
"
17,2,Officer 2,"I play the banjo too.
"
17,2,Officer 1,"Well, thanks for your time sir. You might wanna keep the lights on in your yard tonight in case someone tries to build a cabin on it as well.
"
17,2,Randy,"Will do, officer. Will... do... 
"
17,2,Kyle,"Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
"
17,2,Cartman,"Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! 
"
17,2,Craig,"I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!
"
17,2,Clyde,"Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
"
17,2,Kyle,"You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
"
17,2,Cartman,"And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
"
17,2,Wendy,"I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
"
17,2,Cartman,"Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.
"
17,2,Stan,"It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 
"
17,2,Officer 3,"All right, that's enough. Come on out and there won't be any trouble.  Give it up, Stotch. You've nowhere to run.
"
17,2,Butters,"Huh?
"
17,2,Stephen,"I'll never give up!  I don't even remember doing this! Just leave me alone!
"
17,2,Randy,"Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!
"
17,2,Stephen,"Aw, go to hell, you griefer!
"
17,2,Cartman,"Alright, we've gotta do something.
"
17,2,Corey,"Hello?
"
17,2,Kyle,"Corey Lanskin?
"
17,2,Corey,"Eh yes?
"
17,2,Kyle,"We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
"
17,2,Corey,"Whaaa? What's a, what's a ""Minequaf""?
"
17,2,Stan,"Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
"
17,2,Corey,"Oh no, please don't be angry. My mommy's always angry. ""Get back in the meat locker!"" ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"" But she loves me, right? Mommy loves me?
"
17,2,Kyle,"Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
"
17,2,Corey,"Ohhhkay.  Bye. 
"
17,2,Stan,"What, dude?
"
17,2,Cartman,"Something he said. Did you hear him? He said ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!""
"
17,2,Stan,"So?
"
17,2,Cartman,"You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
"
17,2,Corey,"Now that you've built a workbench it's time to build somethin' that will take care of all those fuckin' sheep!  Just stop thinkin' with your grown-up brains and start usin' your-
"
17,2,Stan,"Aha! 
"
17,2,Corey,"Oh shit! 
"
17,2,Kenny,"(I knew you're up to something!)
"
17,2,Cartman,"Son of a bitch!  Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
"
17,2,Corey,"Kids gotta find some way to make a livin', don't 'e?
"
17,2,Stan,"You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
"
17,2,Corey,"What? You mean like Investigation Discovery?
"
17,2,Kyle,"So you know it.
"
17,2,Corey,"Yeah, I've seen that stuff.  ""'Oo The Bleep Did I Marry?"", ""True Crime with Aphrodite Jones"". Real sick shit. Your parents watch that stuff?
"
17,2,Kyle,"We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
"
17,2,Corey,"Your problem ain't with me, mates. Sure, one or two people might act out what they see in video games, but cable television?  People copy everything they see people do on cable. You're goin' about this all wrong. You wanna protect your family? You're gonna have to go fight the cable company.
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"Hey guys, can I help you?
"
17,2,Kyle,"Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"Ohhh, you don't want cable anymore?
"
17,2,Stan,"No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"You don't like paying for all the channels?  Ohh, our company actually packages channels together.
"
17,2,Stan,"Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"Oh I'm sorry. Our company doesn't work that way.  You want me to give you the number of a different cable company that can-  Oh wait, we're it, aren't we?  Dangit, I guess you have to deal with our packages.
"
17,2,Kyle,"Can we talk to your supervisor please?!
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"Oh, sure. Hey David?
"
17,2,David,"Hi, is there a problem here? 
"
17,2,Stan,"We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
"
17,2,David,"Ohhh you have to pay for the bundle. You can't just pay for what you wanna watch. Darn it.
"
17,2,Kyle,"You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"I guess if you don't wanna be forced to pay for Oprah, you're gonna have to shut off your cable altogether.
"
17,2,Kyle,"Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
"
17,2,David,"Hey Mitch? When can you get out to shut off some cable boxes?
"
17,2,Mitch,"Oh man, it's gonna be like three weeks. There's a whole plug I have to pull out; it's like four inches long.
"
17,2,David,"Three weeks, huh? Okay, is three weeks from now okay with you guys?
"
17,2,Stan,"No, that's way too long!
"
17,2,Cable Guy,"Oh it is?
"
17,2,David,"Oh Jeez, that's terrible.
"
17,2,Stan,"Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
"
17,2,David,"Say... say that last part again?
"
17,2,Stan,"What?
"
17,2,David,"Well what was the last part you said?
"
17,2,Stan,"I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
"
17,2,David,"Nono, the part about your parents not getting the channels easily?
"
17,2,Stan,"I... said it would really bum them out.
"
17,2,David,"How...  How much would it bum them out?
"
17,2,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by for an important message from the president of your local cable company.
"
17,2,President,"Hello. In an effort to comfort the anguished cries or children everywhere, your local cable company has decided to drop all networks that sexualize spousal homicides from regular programming. Customers still wishing to view true-crime networks will now need to purchase a separate package  which will require a technician to service your cable box every night from 2 to 3 am. and must include the purchase of 300 channels in Portuguese. We realize this may be an inconvenience to you, and we hope you will voice ALL your concerns to us, because at your local cable company the customer is always... our bitch.
"
17,2,Randy,"Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
"
17,2,Stan,"Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
"
17,2,Randy,"I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off!  Oh crap.
"
17,2,Randy,"Sharon, I'm I'm sorry. 
"
17,2,Sharon,"No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.
"
17,2,Randy,"No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.
"
17,2,Randy,"Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?
"
17,2,Sharon,"I'm here, Randy.
"
17,2,Randy,"It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you. 
"
17,2,Sharon,"Diamonds.  They're beautiful
"
17,2,Randy,"Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
"
17,2,Sharon,"I've got a surprise for you too, Randy.
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh yeah? What's that?  AAAGH!  Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!
"
17,2,Sharon,"Sorry. I couldn't resist.
"
17,2,Randy,"Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!
"
17,2,Sharon,"Oh I did! That felt really great.
"
17,2,Randy,"Felt great?
"
17,2,Sharon,"Yeah...
"
17,2,Randy,"Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.
"
17,2,Sharon,"Okay.  Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!
"
17,2,Randy,"That felt so good!
"
17,2,Sharon,"My turn again.
"
17,2,Randy,"Okay, hang on.
"
17,2,Sharon,"I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?
"
17,2,Randy,"Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now.
"
17,2,Sharon,"You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house! 
"
17,2,Randy,"OH! Ohoho, you bitch!  Ohohunh.
"
17,2,Sharon,"Oh I love you, Randy.
"
17,2,Randy,"I love you too babe.  OH!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Hey Token!  What's up, bro?
"
17,3,Token,"Nothing.
"
17,3,Cartman,"""Nothin'"" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you?
"
17,3,Token,"Yeah.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?
"
17,3,Jimmy,"Uh, I'm just gettin' ready for cla-
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  About time. 
"
17,3,Stan,"Is he doing it again?
"
17,3,Kyle,"He's doing it a-gain.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? 
"
17,3,Token,"I uhhh, have band practice.
"
17,3,Cartman,"God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. 
"
17,3,Stan,"Cartman, are you feeling alright?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yeah, I feel great. Why?  You think something's wrong? 
"
17,3,Herbert Garrison,"Alright, now the French Revolution was basically started by a young man named Marius. , who only knew Jean Valjean as an older man, and uh-  ...uh, the French government at the time was led by Javert, who was trying to-
"
17,3,Cartman,"Mister!  No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt!  Hey Token. What's up, bro?  Fist bump? 
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open.
"
17,3,Cartman,"It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"And why do you think Token is a tickin' time bomb?
"
17,3,Cartman,"He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Do you think he blames you for somethin'?
"
17,3,Cartman,"But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Wull have you, thought about maybe writin' your feelin's down? In a poem? Uh- write a poem and give that to, g-give that to Token?
"
17,3,Cartman,"No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Well Eric, you need to do somethin' because you keep losing sleep. M'kay and sleep is very important to your success at school. M'kay?
"
17,3,Cartman,"M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, you sure? Because I'm here when you need me.
"
17,3,Cartman,"M'kay.
"
17,3,Cartman,"No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!
"
17,3,Karin,"Eat your breakfast, girls. 
"
17,3,Rachel,"Where's Daddy?
"
17,3,Karin,You can eat without your father in the room. Now hurry.
17,3,Rachel,"Daddy!
"
17,3,Gerry,"Good morning, girls.  Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling. 
"
17,3,Karin,"How did I get such a perfect husband?
"
17,3,Gerry,"How did I get such a beautiful wife?
"
17,3,Rachel,"I love you, Dad.
"
17,3,Gerry,"I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally.
"
17,3,Karin,"Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other.
"
17,3,Reporter,"Today apparently will be the day! CNN has just received word that a verdict in the George Zimmerman trial is expected to come at any moment! Zimmerman is accused of shooting Trayvon Martin, and a jury will now decide his fate.
"
17,3,Constance,"Daddy, who is Trayvon Martin?
"
17,3,Gerry,"Nobody. L-let's just get you girls to school.
"
17,3,Gerry,"Is it bigger than a bread box?
"
17,3,Rachel,"What's a bread box, Dad?
"
17,3,Constance,"Heehee, Dad is so kewl.
"
17,3,Karin,"You can say that again.
"
17,3,Gerry,"Why aren't we moving? What's gong on? 
"
17,3,Reporter,"We interrupt this cool song for a news bulletin. A verdict has just been handed down in the case of George Zimmerman. In a shocking turn of events, the jury has found George Zimmerman not guilty!
"
17,3,Gerry,"Oh my God. 
"
17,3,Reporter,"Many African-Americans are outraged by the verdict, and they are most likely about to go totally nanners. 
"
17,3,Gerry,"AAAAAH!
"
17,3,Protester,"Fuck you, Brad Pitt!
"
17,3,Gerry,"Let's bail!  Everyone get out of the car! Go!  Oh my god RUN!  WAAH! Token. No, Token, we had nothing to do with this. I know you're pissed off, but but be reasonable!
"
17,3,Token,"Fuck you, Brad Pitt!
"
17,3,Gerry,"No! Nonono!  Nooo! 
"
17,3,Cartman,"Hey Token? How are you doing?
"
17,3,Token,"I'm good.
"
17,3,Cartman,"That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist bump. 
"
17,3,Cartman,"No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!
"
17,3,Token,"Okay, really?
"
17,3,Cartman,"No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! 
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Now Eric, whatever it is you and Token are going through, you need to talk through it, m'kay? The problems you two are havin' have become a distraction for everybody else. Agreed?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Agreed.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Okay. Token, come on in, please. 
"
17,3,Cartman,"Hoh boy, here we go.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Token, I've been talkin' with Eric and he's really upset that you two aren't gettin' along. You have some things you wanna say, Eric?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?
"
17,3,Token,"...What jury?
"
17,3,Cartman,"This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Okay Token, what are your feelings about that?
"
17,3,Token,"I don't know what to say.
"
17,3,Cartman,"I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called ""I Was Not The Bullet."" 
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
""Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?""
I was not the verdict.
"
17,3,Token,"This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.
"
17,3,Cartman,"It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.
I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.
"
17,3,Token,"Can I go back to class now?
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, do you feel better about all this?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, thanks Token. 
"
17,3,Cartman,"It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
"
17,3,Cheerleaders,"We are Cows, proud and true! Come on, South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows!
"
17,3,Principal Victoria,"Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song,  based on his award-winning poem, ""I Was Not The Bullet,"" with backup music by Butters Stotch. 
"
17,3,Cartman (Butters),"Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the jury, so don't blame me, son!
James my man was wrong (It's not our fault). James my man was wrong (It's not Eric's fault).
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
White people say Ho-oh!
"
17,3,The kids,"Ho-oh.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! 
"
17,3,The kids,"Ho ho!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say ""I don't blame the white people. No no no!""
"
17,3,Token,"Alright, that's enough!  You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Token, calm down.
"
17,3,Token,"What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! 
"
17,3,Cartman,"Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!  Mom it's starting! We've gotta go!  Come on, come on!  Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! 
"
17,3,Woman,"Does that little boy have a gun?
"
17,3,Man,"Get inside. 
"
17,3,Woman,"But-
"
17,3,Man,"Get inside! 
"
17,3,Cartman,"Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!
"
17,3,Driver,"What's going on?!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Get to an airport!
"
17,3,Driver,"An airport?! But...?
"
17,3,Cartman,"We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! 
"
17,3,Announcer,"Now calling rows 10 through 30 for boarding.
"
17,3,Cartman,"The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! 
"
17,3,Passenger 1,"An outbreak? 
"
17,3,Passenger 2,"Which one?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God! 
"
17,3,Pilot,"My God, what's going on out there?
"
17,3,Cartman,"The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! 
"
17,3,Copilot,"Maybe now you can tell us what the hell is going on?!
"
17,3,Cartman,"The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
"
17,3,Passenger 3,"What contagion? My wife didn't get on the plane.  Take this plane back to Denver!
"
17,3,Cartman,"You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! 
"
17,3,Captain,"Alright what the hell is going on here?!
"
17,3,Worker 1,"We don't know anything. First there was talk of a hijacking, then reports of an outbreak of some kind.
"
17,3,Worker 2,"Confirmed report of panic in a rural town in the Colorado Rockies!
"
17,3,Worker 3,"Sir, the pilot of flight 82 wants an update. They're asking permission to land.
"
17,3,Captain,"Stall them. I don't want that plane landing anywhere until we know what the hell we're dealing with!
"
17,3,Worker 4,"Sir, you'd better look at this. This was found in the airport lavatory. It seems to be a survival guide of some kind.
"
17,3,Captain,"Survival of what?
"
17,3,Worker 4,"From the looks of it, a contagion outbreak of the worst kind. 
"
17,3,Captain,"Oh my God.
"
17,3,Pilot,"DA43 to tower, please advise!  Damnit! They aren't telling me anything!
"
17,3,Copilot,"Do you think it's a virus?
"
17,3,Pilot,"Virus, bacteria, either way we're all dead! Find out if he thinks it's safe to land in Los Angeles.
"
17,3,Copilot,"What about Los Angeles? Can we take the plane to Los Angeles?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. 
"
17,3,Copilot,"This plane won't make it to Iceland!
"
17,3,Passenger 3,"You got a better idea, asshole?!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Everyone quiet! I have to think!
"
17,3,Driver,"Yes, let him think!
"
17,3,Cartman,"I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. 
"
17,3,Occupant,"Oh, I'm just finishing up.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Nah! 
"
17,3,Occupant,"Hey!
"
17,3,Cartman,"One of them is in the back!
"
17,3,Driver,"What?!
"
17,3,Passenger 3,"What do you mean?!
"
17,3,Copilot,"Everyone just calm down! We have to stay in control! 
"
17,3,Passenger 4,"I won't become one of them! 
"
17,3,Copilot,"Shoot it! 
"
17,3,Girls,"Engine engine #9 running down Chicago Line, if the train should jump the track do you want your money back? 
"
17,3,Butters,"Yes.
"
17,3,Girls,"Y-E-S spells yes- 
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Now, Token, what you need to understand, m'kay, is that a school assembly is not the time and the place to be yellin' and causin' distractions. M'kay? If there's somebody causin' you problems, then we don't disrupt the assembly, m'kay. You come and you talk to me.
"
17,3,Token,"He's just out looking for trouble.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Well that's your side of it, Token, but you know Eric has his side as well. Have you thought about maybe writin' him a poem? M'kay? Write E- write Eric a poem, tell him how you feel.  You know, m'kay? Well I'm tellin' you, Token, you let it go, and he'll let it go, and it'll all be fine. Can ya?
"
17,3,Driver,"No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere.  Matt? Matt?!  My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
"
17,3,Pilot,"Help! Help me!  Please, I have two little girls in Chicago. Please find them!
"
17,3,Cartman,"It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
"
17,3,Pilot,"Then you have to stop it.
"
17,3,Driver,"Yes!
"
17,3,Pilot,"And there must be... a Patient Zero... The person it all starts from.
"
17,3,Cartman,"His name is Token.
"
17,3,Driver,"We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!
"
17,3,Cartman,"I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
"
17,3,Pilot,"You have to! You have to be strong. If you can stop this- if you can save the world- then you have to do it.  Promise me! Promise... me!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
"
17,3,Pilot,"Thank you-wait, what? 
"
17,3,Driver,"Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
17,3,Cartman,"We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
"
17,3,Driver,"Yes!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Come on! 
"
17,3,Reporter,"First, a wave of 911 calls about a virus, and now a plane has apparently gone down in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Is this the beginning of the end?
"
17,3,Butters,"Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!
"
17,3,Reporter,"The government is looking for a Patient Zero, going only off of this sketch which was found in a notebook at the airport.
Anyone with information regarding Patient Zero is asked to contact the authorities immediately.
"
17,3,Butters,"Holy Moly.
"
17,3,Jimbo,"Can I help you?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
"
17,3,Jimbo,"Alright, you want a rifle!  well, like this .22 caliber.  What is it you intend to shoot?
"
17,3,Cartman,"A person. 
"
17,3,Jimbo,"...You mean a person who's threatening you?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Threatening all of us!
"
17,3,Driver,"Please, please hurry! It's important!
"
17,3,Jimbo,"Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.
"
17,3,Cartman,"What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!
"
17,3,Jimbo,"You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a ""stand your ground"" law.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Stand my ground?
"
17,3,Driver,"Please! We're running out of time!
"
17,3,Jimbo,"See now with a ""stand your ground"" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
"
17,3,Jimbo,"No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a ""stand your ground"" law, like Florida.
"
17,3,Cartman,"This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?
"
17,3,Jimbo,"So long as they're threatening you.
"
17,3,Driver,"What?! What is it, please?! Hurry, my husband might still be alive!
"
17,3,Cartman,"The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!
"
17,3,Flight Attendant,"This plane is going to Baltimore.
"
17,3,Cartman,"If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. 
"
17,3,Driver,"What are we going to do?
"
17,3,Cartman,"I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.
"
17,3,Driver,"What if he attacks us first?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.
"
17,3,Driver,"I haven't had the time to thank you, for doing what you've d- 
"
17,3,Mom,"Eat your breakfast, girls. 
"
17,3,Older Daughter,"Where's Daddy?
"
17,3,Mom,"You can eat without your father in the room. Now hurry. 
"
17,3,Older Daughter,"Daddy!
"
17,3,George Zimmerman,"Good morning, girls.  Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling. 
"
17,3,Mom,"How did I get such a perfect husband, Geroge Zimmerman?
"
17,3,George Zimmerman,"And how did I get such a beautiful wife?
"
17,3,Older Daughter,"I love you, Dad.
"
17,3,George Zimmerman,"I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally.
"
17,3,Mom,"Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other.
"
17,3,Reporter,"Is there any hope for stopping the zombie apocalypse?  CNN has just received word that the government has learned the identity of Patient Zero.  The nine year old threat to humanity has been tracked down, and measures are being taken to stop him.
"
17,3,Younger Daughter,"Daddy, what's a Patient Zero? 
"
17,3,Agent 1,"Hello, Mr. Zimmerman. Your country needs you.
"
17,3,George Zimmerman,"What do you need from me?
"
17,3,Agent 1,"We...  need you to shoot a young African-American for us.
"
17,3,George Zimmerman,"I gave that up.
"
17,3,Agent 2,"You're the best, Zimmerman. We just need you to do it one more time, for the security of the world!
"
17,3,George Zimmerman,"Damnit, I have a wife and kids now.
"
17,3,Agent 1,"Then do it for your family!  This is about protecting people, Zimmerman! Keeping our streets safe so that our children are free to go out... 
"
17,3,George Zimmerman,"Something's wrong.  Look out! 
"
17,3,Agent 1,"My God, I didn't even see him. 
"
17,3,Agent 2,"Nice work, Zimmerman. 
"
17,3,George Zimmerman,"Are you guys okay?
"
17,3,Older Daughter,"What was that, Daddy?
"
17,3,George Zimmerman,"More needless violence.
"
17,3,Agent 1,"Nonsense, you did what you had to. You're a hero.
"
17,3,George Zimmerman,"That may be true, but I'll have to live with this the rest of my life. Even though I'll be walking around a free man.
"
17,3,Agent 2,"Hey, wait a minute. This kid isn't black, he's white.
"
17,3,George Zimmerman,"Wait, what?
"
17,3,Judge,"Guilty!
"
17,3,Reporter,"The zombie apocalypse... is over. All the panic, crashing planes and chaos appear to have, for some reason, died with George Zimmerman. And as for the little boy who was so mercilessly gunned down?  Although he survived the shooting, his wishes are to remain anonymous, giving the hospital only the nickname... ""Brad Pitt."" ...But cooler.
"
17,3,Stan,"That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
"
17,3,Kyle,"Yeah, that sucked.
"
17,3,Butters,"Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
"
17,3,Cartman,"Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.
"
17,3,Token,"You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.
"
17,3,Token,"So what?!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.
"
17,3,Token,"Fuck you!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. 
"
17,3,Token,"Oh! 
"
17,3,Cartman,"That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. 
"
17,3,Gerry's Daughters,"Daddy!
"
17,3,Gerry,"What's up girls? Daddy did it!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
"
17,3,Kyle,"You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yeah. So bad.
"
17,3,Kyle,"That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Jury found me innocent, Kyle!
"
17,3,Kyle,"You're a murderer.
"
17,3,Cartman,"You interrupt people when they talk.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Eric Cartman to the counselor's office please.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Oh man! 
"
17,3,Cartman,"Oh boy.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Have a seat, Eric. Now boys, I for one am sick and tired of this little feud you're having, okay? This has clearly gone too far, and you owe each other an apology or you're gettin' detention!
"
17,3,Token,"An apology?! He shot me!
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Well he was technically standing his ground, Token.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.
"
17,3,Token,"Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Token, calm down.
"
17,3,Token,"And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Oh God, here we go again! 
"

"
17,4,Henrietta,"So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more.
"
17,4,Pete,"Whoa... That's pretty hardcore. 
"
17,4,Michael,"That's real pain right there. 
"

"
17,4,Mrs. Biggle,"Oh, but remember, Daddy wanted to talk to you in the living room, my dark little princess.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!

"
17,4,Mr. Biggle,"Henrietta, as you know, your mother and I have been concerned about your behavior for some time.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Are we really doing this again?!
"
17,4,Mr. Biggle,"We've had a hard time coping with the dark things you're into, but we've finally had some counseling, and apparently we're not the only parents who have a child that is... emo.

17,4,Mrs. Biggle,"But Daddy and I love our little muffin, even if she's emo or not.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!
"
17,4,Mr. Biggle,"Do you know how your foul language breaks your mother's heart?
"
17,4,Mrs. Biggle,"Like calling Mommy Demon Jizz.
"
17,4,Mr. Biggle,"So listen, sweetie, we've found a camp. 
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Noo...
"
17,4,Mr. Biggle,"A camp which is for troubled kids like you, and you get to work outside and learn about responsibility.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"I'm not going to any fucking camp!
"
17,4,Mr. Biggle,"It's for two weeks, and when you come back we can talk about earning back some of your privileges.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!
"
17,4,Mrs. Biggle,"Theeeey have a horseshoe pit where you can challenge the other kids to horsehoooes.
"
17,4,Pete,"And that's all you know? what else did she say?
"
17,4,Michael,"She said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks.
"
17,4,Pete,"Oh my God, for two weeks?
"
17,4,Firkle,"Is she at the camp now?
"
17,4,Michael,"I don't know.  She texted from the bus they put her on, then she said she wasn't even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going. Then all of a sudden her texts went dark.
"
17,4,Pete,"Whoa...
"
17,4,Firkle,"That's fucking creepy man.
"
17,4,Michael,"I just can't believe it. I can't believe parents would do that to their child.
"
17,4,Worker,"Alright now, you say that you witnessed your friend being abused by her parents.
"
17,4,Michael,"Yes. They called her an emo.
"
17,4,Worker,"What's wrong with that?
"
17,4,Michael,"Emos suck! Their vile, self-pitying, depressed assholes!
"
17,4,Worker,"So, why do you think they called her that?
"
17,4,Michael,"Because she's Goth, and some ignorant people don't know the difference!
"
17,4,Worker,"What is the difference?
"
17,4,Pete,"Oh my God! They're totally different!
"
17,4,Worker,"Okay, different how?
"
17,4,Pete,"They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible!  You're, you know... They're posers!
"
17,4,Firkle,"Emos suck my Goth balls.
"
17,4,Michael,"Alright alright, think of it this way: a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up. But an emo thinks that deep down, they are totally fucked up.
"
17,4,Worker,"That's not much of a difference.
"
17,4,Pete,"That's a huge fucking difference!
"
17,4,Michael,"Okay okay, look, emos are more prone to suicide.
"
17,4,Pete,"This fuckin' bitch, man.
"
17,4,Michael,"But goths are more prone to be depressed that so many people commit suicide
"
17,4,Pete,"Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.
"
17,4,Michael,"Wait, I thought we were cynical. ...What what whatever, it doesn't matter.
"
17,4,Pete,"No, see, you're nihilistic.
"
17,4,Michael,"Oh yeah, you're right.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this!  This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here! 
"
17,4,Pete,"What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?
"
17,4,Michael,"She's only been there two weeks. They can't have changed her that much. Can they have? 
"
17,4,Firkle,"Oh. My. God. 
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Hey guys. 
"
17,4,Pete,"What the hell have they done to you?
"
17,4,Henrietta,"What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me. 
"
17,4,Michael,"Oh my God it's worse than we thought! They made her emo!
"
17,4,Michael,"Has she said one word to either one of you guys?
"
17,4,Pete,"Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person. 
"
17,4,Michael,"She won't even look at us. All she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids. 
"
17,4,Emo Boy,"God, PE class is for such wannabe posers.
"
17,4,Emo Girl,"I'd rather kill myself than put on gym shorts.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all die.
"
17,4,Pete,"Uugh, how could she hang out with them??
"
17,4,Michael,"There must something else going on here.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Not now Mom! I'm suicidal!
"
17,4,Michael,"It's not your mom, it's me.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Oh, hey. 
"
17,4,Michael,"What did they do you you? At that camp?
"
17,4,Henrietta,"What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.
"
17,4,Michael,"Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that place turned you into an emo.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?
"
17,4,Michael,"Then why are you listening to Sunny Day Real Estate?  I was thinking, maybe they just made you confused at that place. Maybe they didn't know what they were doing. But then I started thinking, maybe that place... turned you emo on purpose. Like maybe they knew what they were doing.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"You should probably stop digging for answers.
"
17,4,Michael,"What?!
"
17,4,Henrietta,"There's no winning this for you.  Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.
"
17,4,Michael,"Nooo waaaaay.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.
"
17,4,Michael,"Omigodnowaaaaaaaaay.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth?  Join us!
"
17,4,Michael,"No waaay!  No way no waaaaaay!
"
17,4,A ring tone,"Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and desp-
"
17,4,Pete,"Hello?
"
17,4,Michael,"It's worse thann we thought.
"
17,4,Pete,"What is? Everything? 
"
17,4,Michael,"No! I mean Henrietta. I confronted her and she was all like ""I am emo! And emos are going to rule the world"" and I was like ""No waaay!"" and she was like ""Yeah, soon it will be too late."" and I was all ""No waaay!""
"
17,4,Pete,"No way.
"
17,4,Michael,"Yeah, so listen: call up Firkle and meet me at Village Inn. I gotta run home, but I'll be there in ten minutes. 
"
17,4,Mom,"Michael! Michael! 
"
17,4,Michael,"Can't now, Mom! I've got an emergency!
"
17,4,Dad,"In the dining room Michael! Let's go!  Have a seat, son.  Your mom and I have decided you're going to go away for a little while.
"
17,4,Michael,"What??
"
17,4,Dad,"We've been put in touch with this camp for troubled kids like you and-
"
17,4,Michael,"What the hell are you talking about?!
"
17,4,Mom,"This place gonna fix you, make you normal child! 
"
17,4,Michael,"No! You've gotta listen to me! You don't know what you're doing!!  You fucking conformists!  They're evillll!
"
17,4,Pete,"I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.
"
17,4,Firkle,"Pete... if they get me... if I get sent to that camp... and I come back Emo... kill me. Promise that you'll kill me.
"
17,4,Pete,"I promise.
"
17,4,Waitress,"Hey, you kids need to order somethin' or you need to go! 
"
17,4,Pete,"Not now, lady, we're really depressed.
"
17,4,Waitress,"So what else is new?
"
17,4,Pete,"This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos!  There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires.
"
17,4,Firkle,"Are you crazy?
"
17,4,Pete,"What choice do we have?!
"
17,4,Firkle,"The Vampires are our sworn enemy. We beat up their leader, and burned down their lair. Don't you remember?
"
17,4,Pete,"Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help.
"
17,4,Vampir,"Okay, let's all be seated please?  This is thee noon meeting of the Vamp kids? I am Mike, your lord and dark master, per se.
"
17,4,Vamps,"Hail Mike.
"
17,4,Mike,"Okay uhhh, our main order of business is of course the Halloween social. We're still looking for volunteers to make the- 
"
17,4,Mohawk Vamp,"It's the Goth kids! 
"
17,4,Pete,"Ugh. You spit on me, Larry.  Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, aaand we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall.
"
17,4,Firkle,"Sorry.
"
17,4,Pete,"But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem.
"
17,4,Mike,"You've got a lot of nerve coming here!
"
17,4,Pete,"Now, shut up Mike. Listen, okay? There's a camp that kids like us are being sent to, a-and somehow this place is taking kids like us and... turning them Emo.  Yeah. You might not even be able to tell at first. It could have already happened. One of you might already be turned.
"
17,4,Black Vamp,"Okay hold up! Hold up! You mean that one of us might not really be a Vamp kid? 
"
17,4,Pete,"Uhhhhh, right.
"
17,4,Black Vamp,"Well whoever you is, you better get yo' ass ready to run, muthafucka, 'cause you're a damn traitor! And I bet you it's this little nigga right here!
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?
"
17,4,Emo Girl,"I can't. I'm too depressed. I keep cutting myself.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in. 
"
17,4,Mrs. Biggle,"Henrietta, I baked cookies for your new little Emo friends.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?!  I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted! 
"
17,4,Mr. Biggle,"Does she still seem better?
"
17,4,Mrs. Biggle,"Oh, much better! She didn't call me a bitch, and she actually apologized to me.
"
17,4,Mr. Biggle,"Well that's more like it.
"
17,4,Emo Boy 1,"You know what we should do? After us Emos take over the Earth? We should um, paint the White House black. And we should have Fall Out Boy at the Super Bowl. 
"
17,4,Emo Boy 2,"We're Emos.  When we rule the Earth we're not gonna have football.
"
17,4,Emo Boy 1,"Oh yeah. 
"
17,4,Mike,"And you say she just showed up like this?
"
17,4,Pete,"You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!
"
17,4,Cowlick Vamp,"That blonde Emo is Sarah Collins. She was a Vamp kid two weeks ago.
"
17,4,Black Vamp,"You want me to go in there and waste these mothafuckas?! I'll do it!
"
17,4,Pete,"We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.
"
17,4,Mike,"Indeed. If there is some kind of black magic at work creating these monsters, then we will have to use our most powerful Vampiric abilities to stop it.
"
17,4,Cowlick Vamp,"Do you mean?
"
17,4,Mike,"Yes, my child of darkness. We must call upon the powers of the Vamp kids' most sacred entity, per se. Only he can help us in this darkest time. This calls... for a summoning.
"
17,4,Mike,"We call upon the creator of all that is dark! The godfather of Death and Despair! Edgar Allan Poe, your followers in darkness beg for your help!  We summon to the world of the living the great Edgar Allan Poe! Knower of all that is misery! Your children need special guidance! Per se.
"
17,4,Pete,"This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!
"
17,4,Mike,"Edgar Allan Poe was the original Vamp kid.
"
17,4,Pete,"No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!
"
17,4,Black Vamp,"Ey, look man! All genres of Gothic subcultures are derivatives of Poe's work. Muthafucka!
"
17,4,Pete,"Look, we came to you for help, and all you've done since then is waste our time! 
"
17,4,Cowlick Vamp,"Holy shit look! 
"
17,4,Poe,"Where am I? What is this place?
"
17,4,Firkle,"It's him! It's Edgar Allan Poe.
"
17,4,Poe,"Why have the living summoned me from my rest? 
"
17,4,Pete,"Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos.
"
17,4,Poe,"Emos? ...Ew-oh my God, Emos are such wannabe conformists.
"
17,4,Mike,"Yeah, oh yes!
"
17,4,Pete,"Right!
"
17,4,Poe,"Children of Darkness, I would help you, but I fear I cannot be seen with a bunch of douchey Vamp kids and their poser-ass plastic fangs.
"
17,4,Pete,"Thank you!
"
17,4,Mike,"Hey!
"
17,4,Pete,"I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.
"
17,4,Poe,"Agrees with who? Is that red dye in your hair or did a blood demon take a shit on your head, poser?
"
17,4,Black Vamp,"Ah ah! He got you there, nigga!
"
17,4,Pete,"Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.
"
17,4,Poe,"Why should I? Just 'cause you summoned me doesn't mean you're the boss of me!
"
17,4,Pete,"Uh, yeah, it kind of does.
"
17,4,Poe,"Oh okay, Mom. Let's go fight the Emos, Mom.
"
17,4,Michael,"What? Where are you tay- No! NO!!  What the hell?? ...Oh my God.  Get me out of here! Let me go!
"
17,4,Gardener,"Shhhhh.  It's best you don't upset them. 
"
17,4,Michael,"What the hell are you doing to people?!
"
17,4,Gardener,"Not me. I just work for them. They're not evil, you know? They're just misunderstood. All I do is help the Emos get into their human hosts. They promised me when they take over Earth I can have a cabin on the lake, and all the steak I can eat.
"
17,4,Michael,"Wait a minute. Emos are plants? 
"
17,4,Gardener,"Shhh, shhh, it's okay. Not just any plants. They're very unique. Very special. Nobody undertands them. Emoclarus americanus. Wonderful species. Except for their tendencies of self-mutilation and the need for other species to acknowledge their pain.
"
17,4,Michael,"Oh, it all makes sense now! 
"
17,4,Gardener,"Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry, Emo King.  Oh no, I wasn't talking to him. I mean, I was, but- Y-yes! Yes, I understand.  Right away.
"
17,4,Michael,"No.  What are you doing?! I don't wanna be emo!
"
17,4,Gardener,"You just don't understand. You'll understand them soon.
"
17,4,Michael,"What the...? 
"
17,4,Gardener,"It's quicker if you don't fight it.
"
17,4,Michael,"No, NOOOOOOOOO! 
"
17,4,Pete,"Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.
"
17,4,Firkle,"Dude, Edgar, can you not smoke in the car?
"
17,4,Poe,"You can't tell me what to do! Who elected you the mayor of me?!
"
17,4,Pete,"Cut it out, Edgar! It's annoying everybody!
"
17,4,Poe,"God, you guys are so lame!  And if you want my help, you'd better all stop calling me Edgar.
"
17,4,Black Vamp,"Well that's your name, isn't it?
"
17,4,Poe,"That's the name my stupid parents gave me! I like to be called by my Goth name: NightPain
"
17,4,"Black Vamp, Mike, and Pete","Oh God...
"
17,4,Poe,"What? You guys are posers!
"
17,4,Black Vamp,"Ey, just so you all know, if one of you ain't who you say they is, and we get inside that base and you reveal you're actually one of them Emo muthafuckas in disguise, I WILL go crazy on yo' ass!
"
17,4,Poe,"If one of us is a traitor, it's probably your wannabe vampire leader.
"
17,4,Mike,"Oh, fuck off, NightPain.
"
17,4,Poe,"Make me, poser.
"
17,4,Pete,"Michael?! You here?
"
17,4,Mike,"I feel like we're being watched. 
"
17,4,Pete,"Dude! Michael, are you okay?
"
17,4,Michael,"Kick it over! Stop the plant!  Oh! Oh, thank God you're here. Emos are plants and they're invading human bodies.
"
17,4,Pete,"Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. 
"
17,4,Firkle,"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that's not the plan.
"
17,4,Gardener,"You did very good. The emo plants are very pleased with your dedication.
"
17,4,Michael,"Firkle! All this time I thought you were Goth! How long have you been Emo? 
"
17,4,Firkle,"Don't you see we can't stop them? We might as well join' em. 
"
17,4,Gardener,"Yes Emo King, right away.  The Emo King wants us to proceed at once. 
"
17,4,Pete,"Ugh! Let us go, you ultimate conformists!
"
17,4,Gardener,"Don't fight it. It's quicker that way. 
"
17,4,Mike,"Oh God! I'm starting to feel Emo.
"
17,4,Pete,"Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?
"
17,4,Mike,"He said he was over this, and was gonna hang out at the Village Inn.
"
17,4,Pete,"What?!
"
17,4,Waitress,"Hey, are you gonna order any food, or are you just gonna sit there and drink coffee all day?
"
17,4,Poe,"Leave me alone! I just want coffeh.
"
17,4,Waitress,"Little prick.
"
17,4,Poe,"Bitch.
"
17,4,Pete,"Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you?  What the hell are you doing?! Yo're supposed to be helping us!
"
17,4,Poe,"I can't right now. I'm dealing with a lot and I just have a lot of anxiety.
"
17,4,Pete,"Look, we  summoned you to help us save the world!
"
17,4,Poe,"What's the point? Save some people so some other people can be lame? And then those lame-os can be lamer to some other posers?
"
17,4,Pete,"God, he is such a downer! 
"
17,4,Gardener,"Just let the spores inside you. Stop fighting it.
"
17,4,Mike,"Wait. Look!
"
17,4,Poe,"Okay, I'm here, posers.
"
17,4,Pete,"NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! 
"
17,4,Poe,"What do you want me to do?
"
17,4,"Mike, Michael, and Pete","Shoot it!
"
17,4,Poe,"Really? Shoot a plant?
"
17,4,Michael,"Shoot it! 
"
17,4,Poe,"Wait a minute. What is this?  This says it was bought at Lowe's Home and Garden for $29.95. 
"
17,4,Gardener,"Lowe's Home and Garden?
"
17,4,Pete,"Hey, these are just plants.
"
17,4,Gardener,"No they, they talk to me.
"
17,4,Poe,"No, they're just, like, ficus plants and vibrating pots.
"
17,4,Gardener,"But-
"
17,4,Voice,"Looks like it's over, Harold Flannagan. So we have just one question for you: are you scared?!
"
17,4,Flannagan,"What do you mean?
"
17,4,Voice,"ARE YOU SCARED?!
"
17,4,Flannagan,"YES!!! 
"
17,4,Voice,"That's good! 'Cause you're on... ""Yes, I Was Scared!"" 
"
17,4,Pete,"What?? 
"
17,4,Host,"Look! Look at the camera right there
"
17,4,Flannagan,"Oh my God, are you serious? 
"
17,4,Host,"Your wife Sarah put you up to this.
"
17,4,Sarah,"Haha I got you! 
"
17,4,Firkle,"This is a prank?
"
17,4,Black Vamp,"Oh man that's good! They got us good!
"
17,4,Firkle,"I turned traitor for no good reason?
"
17,4,Pete,"Did you know about this?
"
17,4,Michael,"I have no idea what's going on.
"
17,4,Host,"Howard, did you suspect at all that a gardener job at a camp for troubled teens was a setup?
"
17,4,Flannagan,"No, they really had me convinced!
"
17,4,Host,"And you didn't suspect anything when we had plants tell you to turn Goths and Vamp kids into Emos when really they're exactly the same thing?
"
17,4,Flannagan,"I guess I should have figured it out. I'm an idiot. 
"
17,4,Host,"Tune in again next week, when we make a woman from Milwaukee think she's working at a haunted abortion clinic.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?
"
17,4,Pete,"Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants.  From Lowe's Home and Garden.
"
17,4,Michael,"It was all a prank by some douchey network reality show.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.
"
17,4,Michael,"No, you just kind of did it on your own.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Oh my Gawd.  This is so... em-barrassing.
"
17,4,Pete,"Ahh, hang on. What I meant to say was  we just infiltrated the Emo lair and... we torched the plant leader.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Oh.  Oh!  Ihihit's meee-e! I'm, I'm I'm me again!  Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks you guys.
"
17,4,Mrs. Biggle,"Henrietta, I have dinner ready.
"
17,4,Henrietta,"Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!
"
17,4,Mrs. Biggle,"...Fatty. 
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Students, I would like to introduce you all to the future.  M'kay. Starting today, our school will be operating entirely on IntelliLink.  Now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal.  M'kay...  You can use a computer or any of the IntelliLink panels which are located throughout the school.  Lat's say you're in the cafeteria, m'kay. You start cougin' up blood and need to see the nurse. You just click on ""school clinic"" Mkay, see nurse. M'kay. Respiration problems.  Uh, okay, I must have I must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. As you can see, you can control the sound system as well. Okay.  It's all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m'kay. Let's look at the message board.  Mesage... board.  Here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m'kay? For instance,  here we go. Here's a message from Kyle's little brother, Ike Broflovski.  Okay, little Ike says ""My brother is a homo"" Ike made a little drawing of his brother too.  Drew a nice picture with a... nice bird hangin' off Kyle's forehead, m'kay, that's nice.  It's a nice... crane, a nice whoopin' crane comin' off Kyle's head there.
"
17,5,Cartman,"That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
"
17,5,Butters,"Heheh, yeah. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
"
17,5,Sheila,"Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.
"
17,5,Kyle,"I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
"
17,5,Sheila,"It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Hey Ike, how's it going?
"
17,5,Ike,"Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm on my computer! 
"
17,5,Kyle,"I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
"
17,5,Ike,"Do I look like I wanna do fuckin' fingerpaints?!  Look at the fuckin' zits on my face!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
"
17,5,Ike,"Then stop harassing me, bro! You don't know what it's like to be a baby goin' through puberty! I don't know whether to watch Yo Gabba Gabba or go out and tame some strange!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
"
17,5,Ike,"Dancy Dance is my favorite.
"
17,5,Kyle,"It always has been. See? This is nice. 
"
17,5,Ike,"Who would you rather fuck?  Foofa or Toodee?
"
17,5,Kyle,"What?
"
17,5,Ike,"I wanna fuck Foofa.  I wouldn't wanna fuck Toodee. She's a dike. You can tell. But Foofa, man.  I bet she's got some sweet strange.  I don't even know what the fuck Muno is.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike, is that chewing tobacco?
"
17,5,Ike,"What?! You gonna fuckin' narc and tell Mom?!
"
17,5,Kyle,"No, I just don't think it's healthy.
"
17,5,Ike,"That's 'cause you don't understand shit!  I knew this was a bad idea!  I'm gonna watch Yo Gabba Gabba in my roomsy!
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Come in, m'kay.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Oh-kay, have you set up a counseling appointment on IntelliLink?
"
17,5,Kyle,"No.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Ookay, that's fine, that's fine. We can use IntelliLink to see what's available. Let's see, counseling request. Students. Make appointment.  Okay, ah whoops. Okay, uh sume, uh students make appoint-alala here we go. Make, make appointment.  Uhkay, here we go. Uhkay, what do you need counseling with?
"
17,5,Kyle,"It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, I'll click on family issues. What time did you want counseling?
"
17,5,Kyle,"Right now.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Oo-kay, aaand, what is your brother's Intelligrated smart name?
"
17,5,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Alright, I can do a lookup for the name. Uh go back. Main menu.  Oh... Damnit. Okay now, back.  Set- no, set appointment. Okay, speakers off.  Okay, uh... Okay, what is your smart name, Kyle?
"
17,5,Kyle,"What?
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Sorry, Kyle, we're gonna need to maybe go somewhere else. Uh... find an IntelliLink panel somewhere.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, let's see, lights.  Mood.  Start counseling timer.  Okay there we go. Okay, we got it.  Okay now, Kyle, you had some concerns about your little brother?
"
17,5,Kyle,"He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well it sounds like he's hittin' puberty.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Yeah, he just seems so young.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well, your brother is Canadian. Perhaps Canadian puberty is a little different. Why don't you educate yourself about Canadian puberty and it could be somethin' yeeyou and your brother can actually do together. M'kay?  You know, this is the first time I've been able to do counseling aaand go to the bathroom at the same time. IntelliLink is amazing.
"
17,5,Minister,"Hello young people, and welcome to the most fascinating time of your life. You have braved the trials of childhood, and now you are reaching Canadian puberty. By now, you've probably noticed some changes in your body. For instance, when you fart your dick gets hard.  Other physical changes are happening to your body as well. If you're a boy you may notice that your testicles ache, or if you're a girl, you may notice a tingling sensation in your strange.
"
17,5,Ike,"This is stupid, bro! I already know all this!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Let's just give it a chance, Ike.
"
17,5,Minister,"Going through Canadian puberty, you may notice that your voice is starting to change as well. You're saying things like ""hey boddy"" and ""hey guy"" because now that you're older you're discovering that someone who was once your buddy is now your guy, and someone who you used to call ""guy"" is quickly becoming your friend.  But now let's discuss how a man and a woman make love.  First, a man and a woman fall in love. Then the man farts on the woman's strange,  filling the woman's strange with air so that the woman can queef on the man's face.  And, a baby is born.  The entire process can take up to six months a-  It's what? ... That's not how a baby is born? ... What's semen? ... Well then, why did my wife queef on my face? ... She said it was to- ...  Well then why would sh-?! ... I'm gonna get to the bottom of this! 
"
17,5,Minister,"Make me look like an idiot, will you?!
"
17,5,Minister,"Ey! You told me you queefed on my face because because that's how babies are born!
"
17,5,Wife,"I was being sarcastic.
"
17,5,Minister,"Being sarcastic?! I just told a million Canadian teenages that's how it's done!
"
17,5,Wife,"I was angry because you never listen to me. Because I wanted you to go with me to therapy and you never go.
"
17,5,Minister,"Fine! You want me to go with you to therapy?! Fine!
"
17,5,Minister,"Totally embarrassing and degrading! She queefed right in my face!
"
17,5,Therapist,"Well, maybe you should spend less time at work making public health films and more time at home.
"
17,5,Kyle,"What the fuck is going on?!
"
17,5,Ike,"You're fucking stupid, Kyle! 
"
17,5,Kyle,"I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
"
17,5,Stan,"He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
"
17,5,Kyle,"He doesn't even let me near him!
"
17,5,Cartman,"That sucks, dude.
"
17,5,Kyle,"What??
"
17,5,Cartman,"I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Oh, thanks! 
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, there we go. That's cut the speakers off. Now what was it you were trying to do, Kyle?
"
17,5,Kyle,"I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
"
17,5,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Mackey, can he just go talk to the principal?
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"No, this is gonna work! I called IntelliLink and they said they were sending over an engineer. 
"
17,5,Cody,"Is this Classroom 7?
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Yes!
"
17,5,Cody,"My name's Cody. I'm your smartnician. You're havin' some intelliproblems with your astutelinks?
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, a student is trying to make an appointment to see the principal. M'kay?
"
17,5,Cody,"Uh huh, well here's the problem: your amsrtnames aren't intelligrated. 
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Oh I see.
"
17,5,Cody,"If you wanna have those intelligrated with EasyLink, you might wanna upgrade your system to the silver package.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, I I needed the silver package? Okay okay? Can we do that?
"
17,5,Cody,"Let my call my supervisor on the intelliphone. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Hey Ike.
"
17,5,Ike,"Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm playing trucks!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
"
17,5,Ike,"You promised!
"
17,5,Kyle,"I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
"
17,5,Ike,"Well what am I supposed to do?! See it myself?! I'm a little baby! Who's gonna hold my fuckin' hand?! You don't give a shit about how I feel!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike, I do! I just-
"
17,5,Ike,"You just love pushing me around! Is that what you wanna do, Kyle?! Kick the baby?! Well alrighty bro! Come on, Kyle! Kick the baby!  Come on bro! Kick the fuckin' baby! Let's see you try it, wuss!
"
17,5,Plex,"Hey Muno, what should we do now?
"
17,5,Muno,"Let's play Cool Cool Trick.
"
17,5,Plex,"Aaaall right! Who out in the audience has a cool cool trick to show us?  What's your name, little boy?
"
17,5,Ryan,"My name is Ryan!
"
17,5,Plex,"And what is your cool cool trick, Ryan?
"
17,5,Ryan,"My cool cool trick is that I can jump in the air.  Let's see you... jump in the air! 
"
17,5,Plex,"And what's your name, little boy?
"
17,5,Ike,"Ike Broflovski.
"
17,5,Plex,"Do you have a cool trick?
"
17,5,Ike,"Yeah, for my cool cool trick I'm gonna tame Foofa's strange.
"
17,5,Plex,"Tame mo what?
"
17,5,Ike,"I can tame Foofa's strange, bro.
"
17,5,Plex,"Uhhh, alright. Let's see our friend Ike tame Foofa's strange! 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike no! Stop!
"
17,5,Plex,"Oh, I see. You're actually-  Wait! Oh my God, what are you doing?! No no no!  What are you doing to Foofa?! No!
"
17,5,Plex,"Now you listen here, little boy! It is never okay to take off your clothes and grind on another person!
"
17,5,Toodee,"No, that's wrong!
"
17,5,Plex,"Don't do it.
"
17,5,Brobee,"Uh uh.
"
17,5,Kyle,"We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
"
17,5,Muno,"A little young for that, isn't he?
"
17,5,Kyle,"That's what I thought.
"
17,5,Ike,"This is stupid, bro.  Foofa shouldn't be limiting herself to little kids. She's fuckin' fine, dude. 
"
17,5,Plex,"What you did was very traumatic for Foofa. Isn't that right, Foofa?  Foofa?
"
17,5,Foofa,"He's right, Plex. We're getting older. I don't wanna do the little kid thing the rest of my life.
"
17,5,Brobee,"Foofa, what are you talking about?
"
17,5,Foofa,"It's time for us to start playing to older people. Maybe we need to be edgier. Have a little sex appeal.
"
17,5,Toodee,"Foofa, no!
"
17,5,Foofa,"I'm an artist. And if all I ever do is play to kids, then I'll be a joke.  I have to move on. 
"
17,5,Plex,"Oh God. What has this little boy done??
"
17,5,Minister,"I try not to think about it, Rick. I try to just forget aboot it and then move on, but I can't. I mean... she queefed right in my face!
"
17,5,Rick,"Have you and your wife seen a therapist together?
"
17,5,Minister,"Yes, we went but... I just can't erase the memory of my helpless face being queefed on like that. Who's to say she won't do it again?
"
17,5,Rick,"Don't you think this has something to do with your new job?
"
17,5,Minister,"What do you mean?
"
17,5,Rick,"There's more to this, Terry. A lady never queefs in her lord's face without some major cause. You started as the Canadian Minister of Health and three months later your wife queefed in your face. There's a connection.
"
17,5,Terry,"I took the job to try and make Canada's health care system better. What could that have to do with my wife?
"
17,5,Rick,"Terry, I'm your friend. And I'm not just your friend, I'm also your boddy
"
17,5,Terry,"Thanks, guy.
"
17,5,Rick,"And I'm telling you there's more to this than you think!  And if you want to save your marriage, and your face, you need to figure it out quick.
"
17,5,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Mackey, so far the school has spent  $22,000 on the IntelliLink system, and so far it's been an unmitigated disaster.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well yeah, but see, the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet.
"
17,5,Mr. Adler,"They can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off!
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"I know that IntelliLink has had some... hiccups... uhkay. But I've hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the IntelliLink system and make sure it runs smoothly. I want you all to meet Pat Conners. 
"
17,5,Pat,"Hello everyone.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Don't ""Hello"" us, Pat! This system that you're responsible for now isn't working out! So  what the hell are you gonna do about it?!
"
17,5,Pat,"Oh. Well, I'm just sort of getting acclimated to the situation and I-
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Getting acclimated?!  Do you know how much money we wated on that thing?! How about you take some damned responsibility! Get the hell out of here, Pat! You're fired! Get out!  Well. How the hell are we gonna clean up Pat's mess? I guess, I dunno, I guess we got no choice, m'kay. We're just gonna need to the upgrade to the IntelliLink Gold Package. 
"
17,5,Principal Victoria,"Oh noo!
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"No, see, it's a $10,000 upgrade, but it should clean up all of Pat's mistakes.
"
17,5,Coach,"Mr. Mackey, let's be clear. IntelliLink was your idea. You should admit it was a bad one and stop being so defensive.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well ih it's good to be a little defensive around you, Miles, m'kay. Let's, let's not forget that your wife died of an ""accident"" while you were ""drinking"" on a ""hike,"" ""N'kay!""
"
17,5,Miles,"Hey now listen here-!
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"No! Now you listen to me!  IntelliLink is a great idea, and we just need the Goddamned Gold Package! We are doublin' down!
"
17,5,Anchor,"You are watching E! Entertainment News. God knows why.  She's all grown up and she wants you to know it. From kids show star to sex symbol, Yo Gabba Gabba's Foofa is ready to rock!  She's been seen out partying, photographed smoking pot, and now, Foofa has announced a raunchy performance on the MTV Video Music Awards. Foofa's new manager claims the MTV performance will be one for the record books.
"
17,5,Ike,"Foofa's got that nice shaved strange that you just wanna get in and tame the second you see it.
"
17,5,Anchor,"The video awards are at 8 pm tomorrow.
"
17,5,Foofa,"Oh this is so exciting!
"
17,5,Ike,"Told you it'd go over well.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
"
17,5,Ike,"Shut up, Kyle! Just ignore my little brother.
"
17,5,Kyle,"I'm your big brother, Ike! 
"
17,5,Ike,"Answer the door, twerp! 
"
17,5,Plex,"Can I talk to you?
"
17,5,Kyle,"I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling-
"
17,5,Plex,"Foofa! 
"
17,5,Brobee,"Thank you, dude.
"
17,5,Muno,"Oh thank God.
"
17,5,Toodee,"Heey.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Hey!
"
17,5,Plex,"Foofa, what is this about you going on the MTV Video Awards?
"
17,5,Foofa,"I'm done being a kiddie star!
"
17,5,Plex,"Foofa, you don't have to show your strange to get attention.
"
17,5,Ike,"You just don't get it 'cause you're a robot, Plex.
"
17,5,Plex,"Alright, you won't listen to us, but maybe you'll listen to our special guest, Sinéad O'Connor! 
"
17,5,Sinéad,"Don't do it, Foofa, Don't sell out your strange to those corporate bastards.
"
17,5,Ike,"Awww, screw off, Sinéad O'Connor. No one gives a crap about you.
"
17,5,Plex,"Don't show your strange on TV.
"
17,5,Troupe,"Don't show your strange.
"
17,5,Plex,"Your strange is for your husband, not for all the world to see.
"
17,5,Troupe,"Don't show your strange on TV
"
17,5,Sinéad,"I'm looking for a boyfriend. Looking for a boyfriend.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!
"
17,5,Terry,"...Have you ever had someone you love queef in your face? 
"
17,5,Kyle,"What?
"
17,5,Terry,"I'm sorry, I'm calling everyone in the Canadian health care system to find out if they're pleased with their health care. Is this  Ike Broflovski?
"
17,5,Kyle,"No, this is his brother.
"
17,5,Terry,"Your brother receives his medication from us, so we just wanna be sure he's satisfied with the service.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Satisfied with-  Wait a minute. What medication?!
"
17,5,Terry,"Before this meeting continues, I should have you be aware that my face has tested positive for queefie sores.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!
"
17,5,Terry,"People all over the world get their medication from Canada.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
"
17,5,Terry,"That's impossible! The Canadian health care system is completely integrated and streamlined with IntelliLink. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
"
17,5,Terry,"Sure, no problem.  Now, what is your brother's Canadian Medicare's smartname?
"
17,5,Kyle,"I dunno!  Try ""strangetamer.""
"
17,5,Terry,"""strangetamer""  Uh, yeP, there it is.  Ahh yes, here we go. I see your little brother has a constipation problem and has been taking a daily laxative since last May.  Ah, yes, I'm afraid IntelliLink mixed that up and your brother has been receiving large doses of hormones that were supposed to go to an athlete in the northeast.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
"
17,5,Terry,"Yes, that's right.
"
17,5,Kyle,"That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
"
17,5,Terry,"It's fine!  It works fine! Just give it some time!  God, you sound like my wife!  My... my wife.
"
17,5,Rick,"That must be it. Don't you see, Terry? That health care integration system has made you defensive and hostile, and your wife's been puttin' up with it.
"
17,5,Terry,"And... that's why she queefed in my face.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
"
17,5,Announcer,"Tom Brady looking sluggish again today. Not sure what his problem has been lately.
"
17,5,Tom Brady,"Blue 28! ... Blue 28!
"
17,5,Commentator,"Yeah, definitely not looking as strong and virile as he has in the past, Tom.
"
17,5,Tom Brady,"Huthuuuut  Hike!
"
17,5,Announcer,"Brady steps back to pass.  He's got an open man at the 40 yard line! 
"
17,5,Commentator,"And whatever is wrong with Tom Brady just seems to be getting worse.  Go Broncos.
"
17,5,Cody,"Okay, there we go.  Your students can buy school lunches now, but they won't be able to get grades.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"No, they have to be able to get grades!
"
17,5,Cody,"Well, what you prbably wanna do is upgrade to IntelliLink Platinum.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"No! There's no more upgrades, m;kay?! I just want this  to work!
"
17,5,Cody,"...What exactly do you mean by ""work""?
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"I just want students to be able to make appointments to see the counselor, be able to see the school norse in the easiest, most streamlined fashion!
"
17,5,Cody,"Oh, you want the Centurion package. That's where we take all the IntelliLink panels and we rip them off the walls and we burn them. Then we wipe all the computers of IntelliLink software and you never deal with us again.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Alright, upgrade me to the Centurion package.
"
17,5,Cody,"Right away.  Well alright sir, here's a clipboard you can use for students to sign up for counseling,  and I wanna thank you for choosing IntelliLink. 
"
17,5,Announcer,"The MTV Video Music Awards will be back with a performance from Yo Gabba Gabba's Foofa singing, ""Pound My Sweet Strange.""
"
17,5,Stage hand,"Two minutes, Foofa.
"
17,5,Foofa,"Thanks. Oh my, here we go! 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike!  Wait! '
"
17,5,Ike,"Get out of here, dude!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
"
17,5,Ike,"No, you don't understand, wuss! Why can't you just let me grow up?! Why do you keep harassing me?!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!
"
17,5,Host,"All right, y'all, here comes our next big act!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
"
17,5,Host,"Give it up for the sexiest bitch on earth, it's Foofa!
"
17,5,Foofa,"Come on, Ike. Ike?
"
17,5,Ike,"He's right, Foofa. Part of growing up is rebelling, but I'm gonna get older whether I like it or not. So why push it? I think I'm just gonna let it happen naturally. 
"
17,5,Yo Gabba Gabba,"Yaaaaay.
"
17,5,Brobee,"Foofa? 
"
17,5,Foofa,"Come on, come on, and pound my strange. Pound it like this,  pound it like that.
"
17,5,Terry,"It was a mistake.
"
17,5,Wife,"What?
"
17,5,Terry,"Trying to reform Canada's health care system and being too stubborn to admit that it wasn't working. And even when my wife said the system was too complicated, I wouldn't listen.
"
17,5,Wife,"Oh Terry, I was just trying to get your attention. I'm sorry I queefed in your face.
"
17,5,Terry,"I deserved it. Anyone who thinks streamlining health care into an integreated health care system would go smoothly deserves a giant queef in their face. Thank you, my lady.
"
17,5,Wife,"So IntelliLink is gone, my lord?
"
17,5,Terry,"Yes, I've upgraded to the Gold package. Within no time, Canadians everywhere will be getting their correct medications, and going back to normal.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike?
"
17,5,Ike,"Kyle! It's Dora the Explorer!
"
17,5,Dora,"Come on, let's climb the mountain.
"
17,5,Kyle,"It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
"
17,5,Ike,"Yaaay! 
"
17,5,Dora,"We made it all the way to the top.
"
17,5,Ike,"Oh man, I wouldn't mind hittin' that. I bet she's got that hot Puerto Rican strange. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Yeah, I bet she does.
"
17,5,Ike,"Yaaaay!
"
17,6,Cartman,"Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
"
17,6,Kyle,"About what?!
"
17,6,Cartman,"I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.
"
17,6,Craig,"Where did you find a red-haired cow?
"
17,6,Cartman,"Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
"
17,6,Cartman,"There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. 
"
17,6,Butters,"Whoa, look at it!
"
17,6,Cartman,"You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!
"
17,6,Craig,"Wow, that's pretty trippy.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Alright, Cartman, joke's over. 
"
17,6,Cartman,"What? What joke? This is real!
"
17,6,Kyle,"Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
"
17,6,Cartman,"No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.
"
17,6,Butters,"Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Thank you, Butters! 
"
17,6,Craig,"I gotta show this to my mom! 
"
17,6,Butters,"Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. 
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Your attention, please. Will Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Huh?
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Kyle Broflovski to the principal's office. Please. Umkay?
"
17,6,Butters,"Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Nothing. 
"
17,6,Butters,"Busted!
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Ah, thanks for comin', Kyle.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Wuwhat's going on?
"
17,6,Principal Victoria,"Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator.
"
17,6,Kyle,"I don't speak Hebrew.
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Kyle, please try your best. It seems pretty important.  This.. boy... uhkay... is Jew. Uhkay? Jew... like you. Uhkay? Please... uh, please try... speak... to Jew.
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"We're just trying to tell them that we come on very urgent business. 
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Anything?
"
17,6,Kyle,"He said they come on urgent business.
"
17,6,Principal Victoria,"Ohh, what does he need?
"
17,6,Rabbi 2,"Look, we believe that this school has something which is of the utmost importance to our people! We wish to see the red cow!
"
17,6,Kyle,"The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
"
17,6,Principal Victoria,"For what? What did he say, Kyle?
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"Please, you must understand! The fate of the world is at stake!  The coming of a red heifer is the nost holy sign in all of Judaism. It signals the beginning of the End. It is not just our religion, but Islam and Christianity as well. They all agree on one thing.  That the red heifer means the End of Times.
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"You catch any of that, Kyle? 
"
17,6,Kyle,"It's right over here by uh-
"
17,6,Rabbi 2,"Oh my holy shmear! 
"
17,6,Rabbi 2,"The Muslims! They beat us here! 
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"What's goin' on, Kyle??
"
17,6,Kyle,"He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!
"
17,6,Rabbi 2,"Step away! You all know what this means!
"
17,6,Cleric 1,"Yes! And you know you are about to die!
"
17,6,Kyle,"Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"Don't touch it! 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, ""Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it.""
"
17,6,Kyle,"Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
"
17,6,Cartman,"I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. 
"
17,6,Kyle,"NOOOO!
"
17,6,Rabbi 4,"The Muslims and the Christians are calling for a meeting to discuss the terms of war.
"
17,6,Rabbi 2,"Very well, let us meet to discuss how the world as we know it ends.
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"Alright, so far we agree there'll be no automatic rifles, no shanks, and no chemical weapons.
"
17,6,Cleric 2,"If there can be no chemical weapons, then the Christians can use no nuclear weapons. 
"
17,6,Bishop,"Come on, without nuclear weapons, what kind of final Armageddon is this gonna be?! 
"
17,6,Rabbi 3,"But couldn't we agree on non-ballistic nuclear weapons only?
"
17,6,Bishop,"Yeah, I suppose that's fine.
"
17,6,Cleric 2,"That makes sense.
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"Non-ballistic nuclear only. Alright. Now on to prisoners. Are we all agreeing to decapitations?
"
17,6,Israeli,"Of course we are! What do you think this is?!
"
17,6,Others,"Yeah, come on! Just get to it!
"
17,6,Cleric 3,"Wait a minute, wait a minute! Has anyone noticed something? We are all in a room together. Talking.  Has it occurred to anyone else that this prophecy, which amazingly is in all three religions, could actually be meant to bring us together?
"
17,6,Bishop,"The prophecy says the red heifer signals the End.  Could it mean the end of... war?
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"If the cow is sacrificed in Israel according to the prophecy, then perhaps it could bring about peace.
"
17,6,Anderson Cooper,"After all the years of holy wars and hatred, a possibility for peace... in the Middle East. In the past 48 hours, Jews, Muslims, and Christians have met in Israel to sort out their differences. It may be a rocky road, but many say the chance for peace is real. And all because of a red cow, discovered by a young boy here in the U.S. We'll be back with more on these amazing developments after this. 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
17,6,Cartman,"I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
"
17,6,Kyle,"No shit!
"
17,6,Cartman,"I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said ""No."" I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
"
17,6,Cartman,"No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
"
17,6,Kyle,"Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
"
17,6,Cartman,"But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Dude, go to Hell!
"
17,6,Cartman,"You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Wwwait. 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Mom?
"
17,6,Sheila,"Hi bubbe.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
"
17,6,Sheila,"What is it, Kyle?
"
17,6,Kyle,"You're a fat skank, Mom. 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??
"
17,6,Kyle,"You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?
"
17,6,Cartman,"Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. 
"
17,6,Stan,"How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
"
17,6,Kyle,"I just... thought it'd be nice.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes sir.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes.  I love Cartman's farts.
"
17,6,Cartman,"You what??
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
"
17,6,Craig,"Dude, what the hell are you talking about?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
"
17,6,Cartman,"Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Let's see. Oh! Oh! 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. 
"
17,6,Stan,"What the fuck?
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Come on in.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Wuh sure, Kyle. What's the matter?
"
17,6,Kyle,"If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Well... why do you like his farts in your tummy?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Because they taste so yummy. 
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Well Kyle, that's kind of odd. Uh, not sure how to help you with that.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Kyle, are you sure?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Please...
"
17,6,Cartman,"Well alright. 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yummy yummy.
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
"
17,6,Bishop,"Today... begins the new Israel.  Today, we are all united as one.  Chakam balada.
"
17,6,Crowd,"Chakam balada! Chakam balada! 
"
17,6,Rabbi 3,"Now, let us celebrate under one symbol! 
"
17,6,Rabbi,"No way no waaay!
"
17,6,Muslim,"Epiiic!
"
17,6,David Lee Roth,"Hello Israel! 
"
17,6,CNN Reporter,"The party is officially underway. Jews, Christians and Muslims have united, ushering ten years of Van Halen.  Out in the crowd, people are celebrating like never before.  No doubt Israel is the happiest, rockingest place to be.
"
17,6,Stan,"Hey Kyle.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Hey
"
17,6,Stan,"Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
"
17,6,Kyle,"I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.
"
17,6,Stan,"...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
"
17,6,Kyle,"I just do, Stan.
"
17,6,Stan,"You like... how they smell? How they taste?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes.
"
17,6,Stan,"They're really that good?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes.
"
17,6,Stan,"Should I try them?
"
17,6,Kyle,"NO.
"
17,6,Ringtone,"Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy.
"
17,6,Kyle,"This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?
"
17,6,Cartman,"Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
"
17,6,Kyle,"I don't care.
"
17,6,Cartman,"I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
"
17,6,Kyle,"That's fine. 
"
17,6,Stan,"...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
"
17,6,Stan,"I don't get it, Kenny.
"
17,6,Kenny,"(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)
"
17,6,Stan,"Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
"
17,6,Kyle,"No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 
"
17,6,Spirit,"Kyle Broflovski.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Huh? Who...? Who is that?
"
17,6,Spirit,"Why do you endure all the farts, Kyle?
"
17,6,Kyle,"I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
"
17,6,Spirit,"What you are doing... is the most awesome thing ever.
"
17,6,Kyle,"I... I know.
"
17,6,Spirit,"Who else would take such torment?
"
17,6,Kyle,"That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
"
17,6,Spirit,"You should like, shave your head and get all peaceful about it. Your sacrifice saves the world.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes.
"
17,6,Kyle,"I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
"
17,6,CNN Reporter,"What can this reporter say except that Israel freaking rocks! Things just keep getting better here, Tom. And in a few days, they'll be honoring the little boy who discovered the red cow, here on stage, and things are gonna go off!
"
17,6,Cartman,"You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes! Yes I will!
"
17,6,Cartman,"Huh? You comin'? 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes, whatever you want. 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. 
"
17,6,Stan,"Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
"
17,6,Butters,"Just stop, please.
"
17,6,Kyle,"It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 
"
17,6,Craig,"Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.
"
17,6,Stan,"Hey Kyle.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Hello, Stan.
"
17,6,Stan,"Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
"
17,6,Kyle,"There are greater things at work than what you understand.
"
17,6,Stan,"If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
"
17,6,Kyle,"I'm actually the complete opposite.
"
17,6,Stan,"All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
"
17,6,Kyle,"I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
"
17,6,Stan,"See? You sound like a dick.
"
17,6,Kyle,"I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
"
17,6,Stan,"Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
"
17,6,Kyle,"All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
"
17,6,Stan,"I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
"
17,6,Kenny,"(Huh? Like what?)
"
17,6,Stan,"This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"And now, let us honor the little boy who helped make all this happen, Eric Cartman, and his best friend, Fartboy. 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
"
17,6,Cartman,"Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"Uh excuse me, I'm sorry everyone, but apparently there's some breaking news in the United States.
"
17,6,Reporter,"We are in Colorado where the red cow was discovered, and apparently, two boys have shocking news that might change everything.
"
17,6,Stan,"Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Dude! Do not do this!
"
17,6,Stan,"No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
"
17,6,Stan,"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
"
17,6,Muslim 2,"""Oh"" what? 
"
17,6,Kyle,"I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
"
17,6,Stan,"Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
"
17,6,Kyle,"I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!
"
17,6,Stan,"You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all ""Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!""
"
17,6,Kyle,"Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
"
17,6,Stan,"You should apologize to Kenny too.
"
17,6,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Kenny!
"
17,6,Kenny,"(That's okay, Kyle.)
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"No, what is the new information?!
"
17,6,Stan,"The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Hurray!
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"Oh no, it was a miracle?
"
17,6,Israeli 2,"Then, it's not true. The prophecy is not true! 
"
17,6,David Lee Roth,"Wait, I thought we were all here because of the prophecy of a miraculous red cow!
"
17,6,Rabbi 5,"No, the prophecy is that one day, a fat child with a small penis would decorate a cow to look ginger, not that one would miraculously just fall from the sky. 
"
17,6,Muslim 2,"I knew this was all too good to be true!
"
17,6,Bishop,"We are associating with these heathens for no reason!
"
17,6,Cartman,"Small penis?!
"
17,6,Anchor,"The party's over. Muslims, Jews, and Christians are back at each other's throats, and Israel is once again a place of conflict, and turmoil
"
17,6,Kyle,"Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
"
17,6,Rabbi 3,"No it di'n't.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes! It did!
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"The prophecy was that a fat boy with a small penis would one day decorate a cow to look ginger. We should have known a prophecy like this... was too impossible to ever come to be.
"
17,6,Kyle,"But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
"
17,6,Cartman,"No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
"
17,6,Kyle,"But it's the truth!
"
17,6,Cartman,"No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
"
17,6,Rabbi 1,"Sorry boys, but we've gotta get to our fight. There's a rumble at the Wailing Wall. . They leave, and Kyle turns around
"
17,6,Kyle,"Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? 
"
17,7,Guard 1,"The holiday season... is here, and Black Friday... is upon us. As you know, black Friday is the day shoppers go berserk for holiday deals. Last year, 26 people died, and 461 were seriously injured.  This winter the mall is offering 80% off to the first twenty people in the store.  For you new recruits, perhaps you took this job to see just what the violence was like.  Or perhaps you thought workin' Black Friday wouldn't be a big deal. 
"
17,7,Randy,"I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
"
17,7,Guard 1,"Or maybe you're just too stupid to realize what you've gotten yourselves into.
"
17,7,Chief of Security,"That's enough!  Our only chance of surviving this year's sale is by sticking together! Those of you who signed up are to be... commended.  But I warn you: do not underestimate the battle that's about to take place outside those doors!  Winter is coming.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.
"
17,7,Kenny,"(She's not here right now.)
"
17,7,Cartman,"Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.
"
17,7,Clyde,"Which nobody can afford.
"
17,7,Cartman,"What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.
"
17,7,Token,"If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.
"
17,7,Cartman,"I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
"
17,7,Butters,"Woo, spooky.
"
17,7,Craig,"Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real.
"
17,7,Cartman,"It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!
"
17,7,Stan,"It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
"
17,7,Cartman,"On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!  ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.
"
17,7,Male Anchor,"Well it's almost Thanksgiving, and we all know what that means.
"
17,7,Female Anchor,"That's right. Black Friday is right around the corner.
"
17,7,Male Anchor,"Ouch.
"
17,7,Female Anchor,"And people are already gearing up. 
"
17,7,Shopper 1,"We usually start linin' up around 3 am. We uh douse ourselves in pig blood, because it does help us slip through the crowd when the doors open.
"
17,7,Shopper 2,"We do it every year, part of the family tradition. Last year we lost our youngest daughter. He head was stepped on and crushed, but, in her memory, we're going to find a young girl and step on her head this year.
"
17,7,Shopper 3,"If anyone thinks they're gonna beat me inside that mall, and keep me from gettin'  my kids Christmas presents, they can kiss my fat vagina, 'cause I'm bringin' the motherfuckin' pain! 
"
17,7,Reporter,"Tom, the South Park Mall says they've beefed up security in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year. One thing's for sure, people take Black Friday very seriously.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.
"
17,7,Butters,"Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
"
17,7,Cartman,"They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
"
17,7,Butters,"Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!
"
17,7,Stan,"The House of Greyhawk?
"
17,7,Kyle,"Larry and Brad Stoltsky
"
17,7,Cartman,"But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
"
17,7,Clyde,"Hey yeah, I know.  How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?
"
17,7,Cartman,"Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
"
17,7,Randy,"Hey,  that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?  Oh, thanks!  Gets a little boring around here, you know? 
"
17,7,Guard 2,"Enjoy the boredom while you can.
"
17,7,Randy,"So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? 
"
17,7,Guard 2,"I did.
"
17,7,Randy,"Is it really as bad as they say it is?
"
17,7,Guard 2,"The shoppers... Hm... They started showing up at midnight on Thursday... They... didn't line up, they just crammed themselves near the main entrance... I can see their faces smooshed up against the glass, licking their lips, waiting to get in... God, the sounds that they made... It was 5 am when they opened the doors... There was screaming... blood... people... tearing each other's faces off while holiday music played in the background... I saw a woman... pick up her daughter by the ankle and swing her into some old guy's head... Before I knew it they were all around me... fighting, clawing. Then a hand reached in and pulled me out. Old Cap. He saved us all that day.  When it was over... the front of the mall was... covered in red. Bodies... shopping bags...  And now winter comes again. 
"
17,7,Butters,"Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
"
17,7,Butters,"Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
"
17,7,Cartman,"What do you mean?
"
17,7,Butters,"Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
"
17,7,Cartman,"Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
"
17,7,Butters,"Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
"
17,7,Cartman,"We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! 
"
17,7,Kyle,"Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
"
17,7,Boys,"Yeah!
"
17,7,Craig,"Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones? 
"
17,7,Cartman,"That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
"
17,7,Craig,"I thought we were getting Playstation 4's.
"
17,7,Cartman,"What?
"
17,7,Jimmy,"M ma um m-me too.
"
17,7,Cartman,"...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
"
17,7,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
17,7,Jimmy,"Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox.
"
17,7,Kyle,"Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
"
17,7,Cartman,"That's right.
"
17,7,Kyle,"If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
"
17,7,Craig,"Right. Let's all get PS4s.
"
17,7,Kyle,"No, the XBox's are gonna be better.
"
17,7,Tweek,"They're not better, they're just more expensive.
"
17,7,Cartman,"We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
"
17,7,Craig,"That's exactly how XBox people are!
"
17,7,Jimmy,"Yeah!
"
17,7,Cartman,"Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
"
17,7,Craig,"We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!
"
17,7,Cartman,"Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!
"
17,7,Craig,"Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us! 
"
17,7,Kyle,"No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?
"
17,7,Stan,"I like the PS4's controller better.
"
17,7,Kyle,"Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
"
17,7,Stan,"The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.
"
17,7,Kyle,"Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
"
17,7,Stan,"If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
"
17,7,Kyle,"I know.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. 
"
17,7,Randy,"Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.  Please to put a penny in the old man's-
"
17,7,Sharon,"What the hell are you doing?
"
17,7,Randy,"Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.
"
17,7,Sharon,"Bullshit.
"
17,7,Randy,"I did, Sharon.  I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.
"
17,7,Sharon,"You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?
"
17,7,Randy,"Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!
"
17,7,Sharon,"Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?
"
17,7,Randy,"Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.  Bzzz bzzz. 
"
17,7,Ensign,"Thrusters are at 20%, captain.
"
17,7,Kevin,"Engage, ensign. Warp factor 1.
"
17,7,Dougie,"Captain, we have an incoming FaceTime request from Eric Cartman.
"
17,7,Kevin,"On screen. 
"
17,7,Cartman,"Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
"
17,7,Kevin,"Nothin' much. We're just about to check out a Class M planet that might have new sources of trillurillium.
"
17,7,Cartman,"God these guys are such dorks!
"
17,7,Clyde,"Just find out who they're loyal to.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?
"
17,7,Kevin,"Given the XBox's faster frame rate, we have no choice but to declare it the most technologically fit for Starfleet.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Oh my god they're so gaaay!  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.
"
17,7,Dougie,"Cheap XBox Ones? For real?
"
17,7,Cartman,"The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?
"
17,7,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
17,7,Cartman,"You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.
"
17,7,Butters,"Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
"
17,7,Cartman,"Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
"
17,7,Butters,"I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
"
17,7,Kyle,"This isn't helping us, Butters!
"
17,7,Clyde,"The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.
"
17,7,Kenny,"(What do you mean?)
"
17,7,Clyde,"Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.
"
17,7,Cartman,"What new Elmo doll?
"
17,7,Elmo,"Heheh, who, me?
"
17,7,Announcer,"Just in time for the holidays, it's Stop Touching Me Elmo.  When you press his back, Elmo puts his hand on your knee and says fun things. 
"
17,7,Elmo,"Have you ever been tickled on the inside?  I'm lonely. Are you lonely?  Can I watch you go potty?  You wanna kiss the guy who does Elmo's voice? 
"
17,7,Girl,"Stop touching me, Elmo! 
"
17,7,Announcer,"Elmo also helps kids brush their teeth with his toothpaste dispenser. 
"
17,7,Elmo,"More! More! More! Aaaghghgh.
"
17,7,Announcer,"Don't miss out on this holiday season's biggest gift! Stop touching me, Elmo!
"
17,7,Announcer 2,"Available at South Park Mall staring Black Friday.
"
17,7,Randy,"Morning, Joe, Marcus.
"
17,7,Guard 3,"Morning, Randy.
"
17,7,Old Cap,"What madness is this?? 
"
17,7,Randy,"What is it?
"
17,7,Old Cap,"A new Elmo doll. They're releasing a new Emo doll  just in time for Black Friday.
"
17,7,Guard 3,"Oh Christ, no!
"
17,7,Old Cap,"You've murdered us!  You soulless monsters, you've killed us all! 
"
17,7,Guard 4,"Oh, God, they're already lining up.
"
17,7,Shopper 1,"Eelllmoooo
"
17,7,Guard 3,"No! They can't line up this soon! This is crazy!
"
17,7,Old Cap,"I'll deal with these demons!  If you are here for Black Friday, the line starts on that side of the rope. 
"
17,7,Shopper 4,"Oh. This rope right here? 
"
17,7,Old Cap,"That's the line for Black Friday, so other people can do normal shopping today.
"
17,7,Shopper 4,"Oh. Okay. Thanks. 
"
17,7,Shopper 4,"Elmooo.
"
17,7,Shopper 5,"Give me Elmo.
"
17,7,Stan,"We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
"
17,7,Michael,"Are you for real?
"
17,7,Jimmy,"You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on.
"
17,7,Michael,"Of course we're going to go with the PS4. They're blacker!
"
17,7,Stan,"Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
"
17,7,Pete,"Uhhh, we're just gonna wait until the PS4s become cheaper and more available.
"
17,7,Stan,"No, you can't do that!
"
17,7,Jimmy,"Ya yo you can't, you can't do that.
"
17,7,Stan,"Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
"
17,7,Henrietta,"What's Betamax?
"
17,7,Stan,"Exactly!
"
17,7,Pete,"What's VHS?
"
17,7,Stan,"...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
"
17,7,Michael,"Sorry, I guess we just don't care enough.
"
17,7,Jimmy,"Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us. 
"
17,7,Cartman,"Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
"
17,7,Kenny,"(Yes. What's up, my lord?)
"
17,7,Cartman,"I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  switch sides,  it could make Stan's army problematic for us.
"
17,7,Kenny,"(But Stan and Kyle are best friends)
"
17,7,Cartman,"True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.  Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.
"
17,7,Kenny,"(Yes. That's right.) 
"
17,7,Cartman,"You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
"
17,7,Kenny,"(Yes, I believe we do.)
"
17,7,Man,"Hey, you damned kids!  Get the hell out of my yard!
"
17,7,Cartman,"Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
"
17,7,Man,"No, it's my damned garden and I'm sick of you kids dressin' up and havin' talks of betrayal in it!
"
17,7,Randy,"Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.
"
17,7,Voice,"Doin' alright there, Rookie? 
"
17,7,Randy,"Whoa! Haha.  Yes sir!
"
17,7,Old Cap,"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
"
17,7,Randy,"No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.
"
17,7,Old Cap,"Listen, uh... I know why you took this part-time job.
"
17,7,Randy,"You-d, you do?
"
17,7,Old Cap,"I see it in you. You care about people.  Same reason I do it every year.  You remind me of my son. He died on Black Friday in '89. Guess I'm still trying to save him.  Look, I just want to say I... I really appreciate what you're doing. I promised my wife this would be my last Black Friday I worked. When I see folks like you, it... makes me hopeful that people will still be okay.
"
17,7,Randy,"Yeah... awesome...
"
17,7,Old Cap,"No, damn it!  No lining up behind the velvet rope!  God they just don't listen! 
"
17,7,Jimmy,"C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club.
"
17,7,Craig,"Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well.
"
17,7,Stan,"And who do we have on our side?
"
17,7,Jimmy,"Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton.
"
17,7,Stan,"Did you ask the Vamp kids?
"
17,7,Craig,"They're still undecided.
"
17,7,Stan,"There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. 
"
17,7,Boy,"Playstation...
"
17,7,Jimmy,"Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up.
"
17,7,Craig,"We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing.
"
17,7,Stan,"So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
"
17,7,Corporate Head,"Huh? Isogashii yo! 
"
17,7,Member 1,"Sorry to disturb you sir, but we thought you should see this. 
"
17,7,Corporate Head,"Omae-ya kikei .  Jishu, taihen ne.   Winter is comingu. Choose side-o. Nani kore? 
"
17,7,Member 1,"Just a small down in Middle America, but apparently, a war is escalating.
"
17,7,Member 2,"Sir, if this were to become a news story, and if the first people inside their mall all got XBoxes... well it clearly looks bad for our image.
"
17,7,Corporate Head,"So desu ne... 
"
17,7,Reporter 2,"What's going to be the big item everyone goes for this Black Friday? It just might be the PlayStation 4. Sony has just announced they offering a special Black Friday bundle, called the ""Brack Friday Bunduru,"" which will include four controllers, a map of Japan, a hundred dollar rebate, and, allow you to automatically pre-order for Metal Gear Solid V. No doubt Sony has just raised the stakes.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?
"
17,7,Kyle,"Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
"
17,7,Cartman,"Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.
"
17,7,Randy,"Alright, listen up.  The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.  It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.  Augh! Hold on! Oh God!
"
17,7,Shopper 6,"Wristbands!
"
17,7,Old Cap,"Back! Back, all of you!  If that's how you are, there'll be no wristbands! No go! 
"
17,7,Shopper 7,"Oh!
"
17,7,Old Cap,"Back away! 
"
17,7,Shopper 4,"I'm getting my son that Elmo doll, you fuck! 
"
17,7,Randy,"No! 
"
17,7,Old Cap,"You did good. The watch is yours now.
"
17,7,Randy,"No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!
"
17,7,Old Cap,"This is what we signed up for. Right, my friend?
"
17,7,Randy,"No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.
"
17,7,Old Cap,"Heh. Now you know how serious this is. Whatever your intentions before, protect this town. You are in charge now. Take this.  Don't let... Black Friday... be the end. 
"
17,7,Randy,"Get back inside. We have work to do. 
"
17,7,Stan,"When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 
"
17,7,PS4 Army,"The Princess! Yeah! 
"
17,8,Kenny,"Previously, on South Park.
"
17,8,Narrator,"Now let me tell you, child, of a war that is about to come.  Since time unremembered there have been two.  One dark and unforgiving, the other pure and filled with light.  At the dawn of war, I stand alone, looking out at would be the last battlefield, for winter is coming, and I... am a princess.  Once a common lady of the dark army, but, denied my right to be called princess by birth,  I've betrayed my kind,  and now I have chosen my side: that which I believe is best for all,  for it has the dual-shock controller with a speakers and a touchpad interface.  Our land is split in two, brother against brother, friend versus friend,  and my parent will fight on Black Friday as well. for what? I do not know.
"
17,8,Stuart,"What the hell is he wearin' now?
"
17,8,Narrator,"My followers, though few in number, shall help see me through until I am finally accepted as a princess by all. I cannot rest, for I know that even now, the enemy is training for battle, also preparing for winter.
"
17,8,Scott,"En garde! 
"
17,8,Cartman,"Alright, stop, stop, stop!  This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! 
"
17,8,Scott,"Aaah God ow sorry...
"
17,8,Cartman,"There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! 
"
17,8,Butters,"Yeah!
"
17,8,Scott,"Ah!
"
17,8,Kyle,"Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
"
17,8,Cartman,"The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
"
17,8,Kyle,"It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
"
17,8,Cartman,"That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!  I said, ""You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!"" 
"
17,8,Kyle,"Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
"
17,8,Cartman,"I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!  Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. 
"
17,8,Cartman,"Stupid asshole!  Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard.  Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!
"
17,8,Secretary,"Mr. Ballmer, John and Dave from Marketing are here to see you. 
"
17,8,Ballmer,"Yes, hello. How are things going out there.
"
17,8,John,"Sir, the tides of war are changing.
"
17,8,Dave,"There's a king in Colorado, a young wizard who believes that Sony will have the upper hand if we do not come to his aid.
"
17,8,John,"He claims that with our help, his followers are prepared to fight to the death over which system is better.
"
17,8,Ballmer,"Uhh, what are you guys talking about? You sound ridiculous.
"
17,8,Dave,"There's... going to be a war in this small town on Black Friday, and it's all over the news!
"
17,8,Ballmer,"Guys, these are console wars, not some epic battle for a kingdom. I mean, come on.
"
17,8,Dave,"...but, this one kid said that he's a wizard, and that Sony is helping-
"
17,8,Ballmer,"Guys, guys guys! It's just a video game machine, alright? Microsoft's a company that... tries to be above all the petty commercialism, okay?
"
17,8,Dave,"Ok-Okay
"
17,8,John,"Okay 
"
17,8,Tammy,"Well, Black Friday is still a few days away, but it looks like it's already claimed another fatality.
"
17,8,Tom,"Niles Lawson is on the scene, and Niles, what are you hearing?
"
17,8,Niles,"Tom, tragedy stuck last night when mall security officer Males ""Happy"" Davis was beaten to death with this candy cane after telling a mother she couldn't line up for Black Friday until Thursday night. In honor of the slain mall security officer, the mall has officially decided to drop another 10% off Black Friday deals!
"
17,8,Randy,"Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
"
17,8,Guard 3,"Captain! Captain! The mall is dropping the Black Friday sale another 10%
"
17,8,Guard 4,"What?
"
17,8,Guard 5,"Oh my God.
"
17,8,Guard 6,"They can't do that!
"
17,8,Guard 7,"What? That's 90% off!
"
17,8,Guard 8,"Oh God! They're back! The shoppers are back! 
"
17,8,Randy,"Everybody stay put! I'll handle this. 
"
17,8,Randy,"If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving.
"
17,8,Shopper 6,"We're not on mall property.
"
17,8,Randy,"Well, you're about to be.
"
17,8,Shopper 6,"Well, what if we just walk really, really slow?  Black Friday!
"
17,8,Randy,"You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
"
17,8,Shopper 7,"We can walk really slow. Look. 
"
17,8,Randy,"Smartasses. 
"
17,8,Cartman,"Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick
"
17,8,Butters,"You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?
"
17,8,Cartman,"Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?
"
17,8,Butters,"They don't!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
"
17,8,Butters,"Yeah, I finished it!
"
17,8,Cartman,"So what happens when the dragons show up?
"
17,8,Butters,"Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
"
17,8,Butters,"Wha-what do you want me to do?
"
17,8,Cartman,"Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
"
17,8,Butters,"Who's George R. R. Martin?
"
17,8,Cartman,"He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
17,8,Homeowner,"Hey! I told you kids to stay out of my damned yard!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!
"
17,8,Homeowner,"Yeah?! Well home come every time you talk to somebody. it's about betraying somebody else?!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Why don't you mind your own business?!
"
17,8,Ballmer,"No. Listen, for the last time, we don't have any dragons to send them. If some people wanna choose PlayStations, it's their choice. 
"
17,8,Secretary,"Sir, Mr. Gates is here.
"
17,8,Ballmer,"Bill Gates?  Uh I gotta go.  Hey heeey! Bill Gates actually showing up at Corporate.
"
17,8,Gates,"Hey Steve, how're you doin'?
"
17,8,Ballmer,"Not bad, you know? Just tryin' to get this next gen press stuff handled.
"
17,8,Gates,"I heard there's a little trouble in uh, Colorado somewhere?
"
17,8,Ballmer,"Oh it's- no, it turns out it was nothing, just some kids tryin' to turn the console wars into somethin' bigger.
"
17,8,Gates,"Oh my gosh. Yoy know, when I uh... stepped down and left you in charge of the company, Steve uh, I knew there might be some challenges for you.
"
17,8,Ballmer,"Yeah, well, nothin' I can't handle.  There might be some changes we need to make to our marketing, but I'm optimistic. 
"
17,8,Gates,"Uh huh.
"
17,8,Ballmer,"You know, I think we'll ultimately sell the number of unites we want to. 
"
17,8,Gates,"You're right, Steve. Some changes do need to be made.  Do yo know what weakness is, Steve? Weakness is believing that competition is healthy. See, there was a time when XBoxes and PlayStations could both survive in this world, but that time's done. It's all headed to one device that people game on, watch TV on, socialize on. There's only going to be one winner. I can't have you idiots throwing away everything I worked so hard to achieve.  Clean that shit up.
"
17,8,Butters,"Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.
"
17,8,Scott,"I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
"
17,8,Butters,"Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 
"
17,8,Butler,"Can I help you?
"
17,8,Butters,"Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
"
17,8,Butler,"Who is this, please?
"
17,8,Butters,"Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?
"
17,8,Butler,"I'm sorry, but Mr. Martin does not see fans.
"
17,8,Butters,"We're not fans!
"
17,8,Scott,"Yeah, we don't like it!
"
17,8,Butters,"We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
"
17,8,Butler,"About what?
"
17,8,Butters,"Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 
"
17,8,GRRM,"It's the Red Wedding, isn't it? You hate how I killed everyone off?
"
17,8,Butters,"Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
"
17,8,GRRM,"Oh they're coming. The dragons are on their way.
"
17,8,Butters,"When?
"
17,8,GRRM,"You really wanna know?
"
17,8,Butters,"Please. It's urgent.
"
17,8,GRRM,"Alright, King Joffrey is still at King's Landing, but there's a young blacksmith who wakes up one morning with a plan. And His wiener gently hangs down between his legs. Soft and flaccid, his wiener glistened in the golden sunlight.
"
17,8,Butters,"No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
"
17,8,Scott,"Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint.
"
17,8,Butters,"Uh what's the matter, Scott?
"
17,8,Scott,"I told you I have to eat every two hours.
"
17,8,Butters,"He's diabetic.
"
17,8,GRRM,"Oh Jeez, uh, why don't you kids come out from the cold? I'll order some pizzas.
"
17,8,Butters,"Oh. Okay, thanks.
"
17,8,GRRM,"Come on in! I'll tell you everything that's gonna happen in Game of Thrones. 
"
17,8,Cartman,"Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
"
17,8,Kyle,"If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
"
17,8,Cartman,"It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army , but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.  It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded?
"
17,8,Kyle,"Grounded? For what?
"
17,8,Cartman,"That could be up to you.
"
17,8,Kyle,"No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.  Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?
"
17,8,Kyle,"What?
"
17,8,Cartman,"Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?  Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
17,8,Homeowner,"Don't believe it!  He said that to a bunch of people!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
"
17,8,Homeowner,"You're callin' the cops?!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
17,8,Homeowner,"You're on my property! I'm callin' the cops!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
"
17,8,Tom,"Oh oh!  Oh, it's you.
"
17,8,Niles,"Tom, I'm standing in your doorway because we have a hot news story to report.
"
17,8,Tammy,"We don't go to work for another hour.
"
17,8,Niles,"We just got a call from Bill Gates.  He says he can promise us a bigger war on Black Friday if we play along.
"
17,8,Tammy,"He wants us to side with him?
"
17,8,Niles,"That's right, Tammy. Let's not forget that having a bloodbath on Black Friday is good for the news. It's good for us. The bigger, the better.
"
17,8,Tom,"Our job is to report the news, not make it more violent!
"
17,8,Niles,"Right, Tom. Because you're sooo about integrity. Let's go.  Or maybe I should let everyone in the newsroom know what their two anchors are up to! Back to you!
"
17,8,Announcer,"It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson. Colorado's top-rated brother-sister news team.
"
17,8,Tom,"Well Black Friday is just around the corner and Tammy, it's getting fierce out there.
"
17,8,Tammy,"That's right, and Niles Lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise.
"
17,8,Niles,"Tammy, the excitement over Black Friday is peaking, and none other than Bill Gates himself has shown up to try to make it even bigger. 
"
17,8,Gates,"That's right. We just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their XBoxes at incredible deals on Friday, so we've come to offer swords and battle axes, whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers.
"
17,8,Niles,"We understand that you've donated some guns to the kids as well.
"
17,8,Gates,"Yes, but we are limiting it to one per XBox follower,, because of course, the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety.
"
17,8,Mrs. McCormick,"Yes?
"
17,8,Cartman,"Hi, is Kenny home?
"
17,8,Mrs. McCormick,"Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends.
"
17,8,Cartman,"Forward, men!  That, no-  No, you- You've gotta turn me. 
"
17,8,Jimmy,"It's the enemy! Defensive po-po-p-po-p-positions! 
"
17,8,Other kids,"Protect the Princess! Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Get out!
"
17,8,Cartman,"I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
"
17,8,Stan,"Let them pass!  
"
17,8,Kenny,"(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)
"
17,8,Stan,"The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
"
17,8,Cartman,"You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.
"
17,8,Kenny,"(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)
"
17,8,Stan,"The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
"
17,8,Cartman,"Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
"
17,8,Kenny,"(What?!)  (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)
"
17,8,Stan,"The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
"
17,8,Cartman,"That doesn't even make sense.
"
17,8,Kyle,"Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.
"
17,8,Stan,"What I started? How dare you!
"
17,8,Kyle,"All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
"
17,8,Stan,"I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
"
17,8,Cartman,"You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! 
"
17,8,Stan,"The gods will find us a way!
"
17,8,GRRM,"So then Samwell Tarly sees the army approaching, and his wiener is about this big.  He knows that Stannis Baratheon's wiener is probably shriveled from the cold. Samwell has to rally his men, so what does he do? He takes out his wiener  and he dangles it around for all his men to see. 
"
17,8,Scott,"AAAH! 
"
17,8,Butters,"OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
"
17,8,GRRM,"Yeah yeah, they're on their way. They're still coming. So Samwell's wiener goes 
"
17,8,Butters,"But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
"
17,8,Scott,"If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out.
"
17,8,GRRM,"Don't worry. They're coming. Pizzas are on their way. They're gonna be amazing.  Now, John Snow finally faces Jaime Lannister, and this guy's wiener is, you know, huge, right? So it's not goin' to be easy.
"
17,8,Scott,"Ehhh...
"
17,8,Cartman,"Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
"
17,8,Gates,"Certainly. Uh, Eric, right?
"
17,8,Cartman,"Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
"
17,8,Gates,"Oh I certainly don't wanna step on your toes. Don't worry, I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want.
"
17,8,Cartman,"Your CEOs?
"
17,8,Gates,"Let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
17,8,Cartman,"Uhhh, hmmm. What?
"
17,8,Homeowner,"Hahaa! How's it feel?! Now who's walking who through the betrayal garden?!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
"
17,8,Homeowner,"Why don't you stay the fuck out of my yard?! 
"
17,8,President,"Ish, ish, ish, o-ish, haishooo! 
"
17,8,Niles,"That was amazing sex. I enjoyed it immensely. How about you?
"
17,8,President,"Tanoshikatta ne. (Yeah, it was fun.)
"
17,8,Niles,"You know, Microsoft has given kids who want XBoxes on Black Friday a lot of support. Seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided.
"
17,8,President,"Eh? Nani kore, tsukareta yo. (What? I'm tired!)
"
17,8,Niles,"Black Friday is about to happen and it's not even gonna be a fight. That's bad for both of us. There must be something you can give to kids who want Sonys to make the fight more even.
"
17,8,President,"Hai.  Kore ga arimasu. 
"
17,8,Niles,"Yes, I think that will do nicely.
"
17,8,Chorus,"'Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener 
"
17,8,Soloist,"One wiener, next to another wiener
"
17,8,Chorus,"Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener 
"
17,8,Soloist,"Two wieners alongside yet another wiener
"
17,8,Chorus,"Party, wiener party, wiener party, party party, wiener party, wiener wiener 
"
17,8,Soloist,"Soft wieners, nice and soft, non-erect wieners!
"
17,8,Chorus,"Keep them flopping, flopping wieners, floppy floppy, dangle wieners, dangle dangle 
"
17,8,Soloist,"Five wieners in my face
"
17,8,Scott,"Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more! 
"
17,8,GRRM,"But this is the best part. Right before King Joffrey gets poisoned, everyone flaps their wieners all around his face.
"
17,8,Scott,"Jeaaaaah!
"
17,8,Butters,"Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
"
17,8,GRRM,"Okay, okay, fine fine. What kind of pizzas do you want?
"
17,8,Butters,"What kind do we want?!
"
17,8,Scott,"He hasn't even ordered the pizzas yet!
"
17,8,GRRM,"Don't worry! They're coming! Not just two pizzas, there's, there's gonna be five! And they're gonna be huge! You won't believe it!
"
17,8,Butters,"Come on, Scott! We're leaving! 
"
17,8,GRRM,"Wait, I haven't told you what happens yet!
"
17,8,Butters,"NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
"
17,8,GRRM,"Well why didn't you say so? I can help with that.
"
17,8,Butters,"Whatoyou mean?
"
17,8,GRRM,"I'll make some calls. I know a way to make sure you're completely prepared for Black Friday! 
"
17,8,President,"Sony PS4 no urazuke. Zenbu. Domo sumimasen.
"
17,8,Aide,"The President of Sony bids you thanks for all your support of the PS4.
"
17,8,President,"Sore kara kono gifuto de Princess no Pawaa agemashou 
"
17,8,Aide,"He offers you this gift to once and for all make you an official Princess, and to give you the powers you need to win this war on Black Friday. 
"
17,8,President,"Ima kara ... Princess Kenny!
"
17,8,Craig,"Wow, Kenny's a Japanese princess.
"
17,8,Kenny,"(Wooo!) 
"
17,8,Guard 9,"Oh God. We're done for!
"
17,8,Randy,"My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us.  Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!
"
17,8,Niles,"Tom, we have breaking news from the South Park mall. In an effort to make sure everyone is prepared, the mall has decided to push Black Friday by one week!
"
17,8,Crowd,"What?
"
17,8,Niles,"The genius idea was proposed by George R. R. Martin, who also suggested ""Fuck it, let's push Thanksgiving to December 3rd."" For pushing the date, the mall is now reducing Black Friday prices to 96% off to the first hundred people inside the mall!  This is going to be a fucking bloodbath, Tom. There will be medical tents, ambulances, face-painting, no doubt a lot of people you know and love are going to die! 
"
17,9,Exec. 1,"Taihen! Mada Microsoft watashi no fune tomatteiru.

"
17,9,Deckhand,"Aaaaah! 
"
17,9,Cartman,"He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??
"
17,9,Clyde,"Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Because, because what? Because he's cute?
"
17,9,Kyle,"Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
"
17,9,Cartman,"But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
"
17,9,Liane,"Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. 
"
17,9,Kyle,"This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
"
17,9,Cartman,"He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!
"
17,9,Kyle,"Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
"
17,9,Cartman,"So what are you saying, Kyle?!
"
17,9,Kyle,"I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
"
17,9,Niles,"Tom, Black Friday is finally almost here, and as you can see behind me, holiday shoppers are really getting antsy. People have been waiting out here since midnight on Thanksgiving. They're cold, they're starving, and there's already been a lot of blood shed over these holiday deals. Joining me now is Rick Tellmore,  who's been out here for six days, and= your five year old son was eaten. Is that correct?
"
17,9,Rick,"Yes, yes that's right, we had to eat him. We were all sort of starving out here, so we drew straws, and he drew the shortest one.
"
17,9,Niles,"What is it you're hoping to get when Black Friday does finally start?
"
17,9,Rick,"A a Blu-ray player. Ninety-six percent off, it's gonna be about 20 bucks.
"
17,9,Niles,"Now, some people might say that eating your child is not very Christmasy. What would you say to them?
"
17,9,Rick,"Iiii...
ate my son for a Blu-ray play-er
With a ho ho ho and a jingle jingle jang-le
My son got ate and it tasted good ho ho jingle jingle ho ho! 
Ho ho jingle jing-le
Jingle jingle jang-le
Jingle jingle jingle ho ho!
"
17,9,Niles,"No doubt Christmas is alive and well at the South Park Mall. Back to you, Tom.
"
17,9,Stan,"Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. 
"
17,9,Craig,"At Red Robin?
"
17,9,Jimmy,"That's right. Red Robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall.
"
17,9,Stan,"The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
"
17,9,Craig,"So how do we take over Black Robin?
"
17,9,Stan,"I have no idea.
"
17,9,Pete,"Hey uh, excuse me?
"
17,9,Stan,"Yes?
"
17,9,Pete,"The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?
"
17,9,Stan,"What? 
"
17,9,Kyle,"Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
"
17,9,Craig,"Haha.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
"
17,9,Clyde,"Nobody saw that coming.
"
17,9,Kyle,"Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
"
17,9,Stan,"So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 
"
17,9,Cartman,"We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.
"
17,9,Kyle,"Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
"
17,9,Craig,"Hey, that could work.
"
17,9,Kyle,"Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.
"
17,9,Stan,"And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
"
17,9,Kyle,"I swear, Stan.
"
17,9,Stan,"Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. 
"
17,9,Sony President,"Taihen. Kono console warusu mada owaranai. 
"
17,9,Exec. 3,"Sou desu 
"
17,9,Sony President,"Un?

"
17,9,Kenny,"Ha? Ueddingu? 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.
"
17,9,Kenny,"Waaah? Sugoi-chan. 
"
17,9,Exec. 1,"Purincessu Kenni ueddingu irimasu ne?

"
17,9,Exec. 1,"Horaa! 
"
17,9,Kenny,"Purincessu Kenni daijobu dayo! 
"
17,9,The Office,"Ahh, kawaii! 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
"
17,9,Stan,"Yeah, sure, what about it?
"
17,9,Cartman,"I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. 
"
17,9,Stan,"Why?
"
17,9,Cartman,"Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.
"
17,9,Stan,"Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
"
17,9,Homeowner,"He's lying to you!  They're just acting like they've given up, but it's a double-bluff!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Dude! Dude!
"
17,9,Homeowner,"They're gonna betray you at the Red Robin wedding! He got the idea watching Game of Thrones!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Dude, shut the fuck up!
"
17,9,Stan,"Who is that?
"
17,9,Cartman,"He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
"
17,9,Homeowner,"They're gonna lock you in!
"
17,9,Cartman,"God damn it, shut up!
"
17,9,Homeowner,"He talked about it in my garden to like three other people! They're gonna lock you in the Red Robin and go get all the XBoxes! That's why he wants you to stay back from the doors!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!
"
17,9,Stan,"Did Kyle know about this?
"
17,9,Cartman,"Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.
"
17,9,Stan,"Did Kyle know about this?!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Kyle thought of it.  Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!  You're a fuckin' asshole!
"
17,9,Homeowner,"Fuck you, get out of my garden!
"
17,9,Cartman,"I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
"
17,9,Homeowner,"Go fuck yourself! 
"
17,9,Tammy,"Well, the wait is over and Black Friday is finally here.
"
17,9,Tom,"Niles Lawson is at the scene, and it's about time, Niles.
"
17,9,Niles,"That's right Tom. Mall officials have said they are ready, and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbon.  This year's ribbon cutter is of course George R. R. Martin, who um, doesn't appear to have shown up yet,  but uhh, says he is on his way. Just like the dragons and zombies in his novels, he is on his way.
"
17,9,Butters,"Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
"
17,9,GRRM,"That may be true, but horses have one quality that is unmatched by any other mode of transportation.
"
17,9,Butters,"What's that?  Awww! 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?
"
17,9,Manager,"Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?
"
17,9,Cartman,"Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.
"
17,9,Manager,"It's, it's real? It's for real? Oho my God, I love them!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Yesh, kewl.
"
17,9,Manager,"So Beyoncé is not with Jay-Z anymore?
"
17,9,Cartman,"Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
"
17,9,Manager,"Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?
"
17,9,Cartman,"Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
"
17,9,Kyle,"Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Yes, he did.
"
17,9,Kyle,"Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
"
17,9,Cartman,"It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
"
17,9,Kyle,"What the hell did you do??
"
17,9,Cartman,"What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
"
17,9,Kyle,"No. Tell me you didn't!
"
17,9,Sharon,"He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.
"
17,9,Kyle,"Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.
"
17,9,Sharon,"And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.
"
17,9,Kyle,"Ok-okay.  Stan? Stan?
"
17,9,Stan,"Huh? Hello? Who is that? 
"
17,9,Kyle,"Stan, it's me.
"
17,9,Stan,"Get out of here!
"
17,9,Kyle,"Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
"
17,9,Stan,"You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
"
17,9,Kyle,"You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
"
17,9,Stan,"I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
"
17,9,Kyle,"You didn't?
"
17,9,Stan,"...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
"
17,9,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
"
17,9,Stan,"You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
"
17,9,Kyle,"Stan, don't say that.
"
17,9,Stan,"Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out! 
"
17,9,Randy,"Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!  Stay tough, rookie.
"
17,9,Guard 6,"We're not gonna make it, sir.
"
17,9,Randy,"We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!
"
17,9,Guard 6,"Okay.
"
17,9,Randy,"OKAY?!
"
17,9,Guard 6,"Yes sir! Yes sir.
"
17,9,Randy,"Not one more good person dies on my watch! 
"
17,9,Guard 3,"Oh my God!
"
17,9,Guard 8,"They're comin' in through the roof!
"
17,9,Guard 6,"I can't do this! I'm sorry! I can't do this! 
"
17,9,Randy,"Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!
"
17,9,Niles,"Here we go, Tom. George R. R. Martin has finally arrived to cut the red ribbon. 
"
17,9,GRRM,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to be here this morning on behalf of South Park Mall Partners and channel 9 News, your go-to source for news, weather, and sports.
"
17,9,Shopper 8,"Just do it! 
"
17,9,GRRM,"Very well. In the tradition of our ancestors,  let's bring in the holidays!  But first, I'd like to share with you a few words about my wiener.
"
17,9,Crowd,"AAAWWWW!! 
"
17,9,Manager,"Hey, sorry guys. Red Robin is closed for a special event today.
"
17,9,Pete,"Yeah, we know. We're with the wedding.
"
17,9,Manager,"Oh great, go right on in. 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.  And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.  Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.  What have you found out?
"
17,9,Clyde,"The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Oh okay, that could be a while.  All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.
"
17,9,GRRM,"O soft and pink with purple head.Gently you lay with me on my bed.
"
17,9,Shopper 9,"Get on with it, George R. R. Martin! 
"
17,9,GRRM,"""Growl, growl"" calls the wiener from on high
A little tiny wiener, still so pleasing to the eye.
"
17,9,Shopper 10,"Enough with the wieners already!
"
17,9,Shopper 11,"Yeah, come on!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
"
17,9,Kyle,"Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 
"
17,9,Cartman,"What the hell is this?!
"
17,9,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
"
17,9,Kyle,"I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
"
17,9,Kyle,"The fight is over, Cartman!
"
17,9,Gates,"It's not over. Looks like I came just in time.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
"
17,9,Sony President,"You will not interfere, Bill Gates! These-a children will get their PS4s! 
"
17,9,Kyle,"Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
"
17,9,Cartman,"They're not a part of your betrayal?
"
17,9,Kyle,"No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
"
17,9,Cartman,"No. Whose betrayal is this? 
"
17,9,Stan,"We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
"
17,9,Kyle,"Stan?
"
17,9,Guard 3,"Sir? Sir, Operations just said they need one of us to unlock the door to Red Robin to let some wedding party inside the mall!
"
17,9,Randy,"Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!
"
17,9,Guard 3,"Tom Hanks and Beyoncé.
"
17,9,Randy,"What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé!  I've gotta save them!
"
17,9,Stan,"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?  Then you fucking fight!
"
17,9,Sony President,"Huh?  Sou...
"
17,9,Gates,"Then let's finish it!  You and me!
"
17,9,Sony President,"Ikimashou! 
"
17,9,Gates,"Winner take all!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
"
17,9,Sony President,"Then let this be your last fight, Bill Gates. 
"
17,9,Butters,"Hey, fellas. What did I miss? 
"
17,9,GRRM,"Look at this wiener.  Judge it by its size?Rub it three times and it has a surprise. 
"
17,9,Shopper 4,"That's it! You're not delaying this anymore, you wiener-loving bitch! 
"
17,9,Guard 8,"Happy holidays, Rick. 
"
17,9,Rick,"And to you, my friend. 
"
17,9,Shopper 12,"Grab it Rebecca! Grab it 
"
17,9,Shopper 2,"Kiss my fat vagina!
"
17,9,Shopper 13,"Gimme that camera! Give it up! 
"
17,9,Randy,"Get back! Get out of my way!  Commander Marsh?
"
17,9,Sharon,"Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!
"
17,9,Randy,"WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM!
"
17,9,Gates,"This... is over... Now... you die!  It's over. XBox... wins! 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Yay, XBox wins.
"
17,9,Stan,"Yay.
"
17,9,Randy,"Stan! You're alive! I saved you!  It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! 
"
17,9,Gates,"Go on, kids.  Go get your XBoxes. 
"
17,9,Elmo,"Can Elmo smell your genitals? 
"
17,9,EVGames Clerk,"Happy holidays, guys. What can I interest ya in? 
"
17,9,Cartman,"We'd like to get XBox Ones please.
"
17,9,EVGames Clerk,"Good choice! 
"
17,9,Niles,"Tom, the shopping frenzy is over, and it looks like Microsoft's new XBox One is this year's hot item. No doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console. Black Friday is over. There's been death, violence, horrible human behavior... and the big winner here, decidedly, is Channel 9 News.
"
17,9,Cartman,"The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
"
17,9,Stan,"Yes, it is.
"
17,9,Butters,"The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
"
17,9,Jimmy,"Yeah that's that's that's pretty nice. 
"
17,9,Cartman,"You guys wanna p-play outside or something? 
"
17,9,Kyle,"Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
"
17,9,Cartman,"I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
"
17,9,Stan,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
"
17,9,Cartman,"The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
"
17,9,The Boys,"Yeah, you're right. You make a point.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.  We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!
"
17,9,The Boys,"Yeah!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Fuck 'em!
"
17,9,Announcer,"The South Park video game, coming to stores soon!
"
17,9,Butters,"Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
"
17,10,Cheerleaders,"Yeah yeah, do we rock?!
Yeah yeah, take it to the top!
Yeah yeah, are we gonna stop?!
No way! No way!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Cheer Squad roll call! 
"
17,10,Heidi,"Heidi!
"
17,10,Nicole,"Nicole!
"
17,10,Bebe,"Bebe!
"
17,10,Lola,"Lola!
"
17,10,Red,"Red!
"
17,10,Annie,"Annie!
"
17,10,Lisa,"Lisa Berger. 
"
17,10,Annie,"Oh God.
"
17,10,Red,"Here we go.
"
17,10,Nicole,"Ugh.
"
17,10,Bebe,"Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?
"
17,10,Wendy,"You guys stop it! Okay Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?
"
17,10,Lisa,"But I'm the fat one.
"
17,10,Wendy,"What?
"
17,10,Lisa,"Every cheerleading squad has a fat ugly cheerleader and that's me.
"
17,10,Wendy,"See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?
"
17,10,Heidi,"There's only one boy that Lisa cares about.
"
17,10,Red,"Yeah, Lisa has a crush on Butters.
"
17,10,Lisa,"Shut up!
"
17,10,Wendy,"But Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?
"
17,10,Lisa,"No way. I I'd just get made fun of.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!
"
17,10,Butters,"So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says ""I""-
"
17,10,Lisa,"Uh, excuse me. Butters?
"
17,10,Butters,"Oh. Yes?
"
17,10,Lisa,"Um, well, I was just wondering if...  maybe...  you would like to go to a movie this weekend.
"
17,10,Butters,"Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
"
17,10,Lisa,"Okay, thanks.
"
17,10,Butters,"See ya, Lisa! 
"
17,10,Craig,"Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl.
"
17,10,Clyde,"At least she didn't try to sit on him. 
"
17,10,Cartman,"You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
"
17,10,Butters,"Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-
"
17,10,Wendy,"What the fuck is your problem?!
"
17,10,Butters,"Oh. Hey Wendy.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!
"
17,10,Butters,"Am I just an asshole?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Yeah!
"
17,10,Butters,"Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!
"
17,10,Butters,"Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
"
17,10,Wendy,"She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!
"
17,10,Butters,"Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
"
17,10,Wendy,"What?!
"
17,10,Butters,"I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.
"
17,10,Wendy,"This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!
"
17,10,Butters,"You're a liar!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Look it up, stupid!  In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit!  You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! 
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, take a seat, Wendy. I guess some mean things were said and I need to get to the bottom of it.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Oh good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good!
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, no Wendy, apparently, you called Butters' girlfriend a hobbit.
"
17,10,Wendy,"...Are you serious?
"
17,10,Butters,"You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
"
17,10,Wendy,"That's not his girlfriend! It's Kim Kardashian!
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh but, but Wendy, Kim Kardashian is considered to be extremely beautiful, mkay?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit.
"
17,10,Butters,"Oh, she said it again!
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Now, Wendy, Kim might be uh, full-figured, but a woman's outward appearance isn't all that matters, nkay?! Have you stopped to consider that maybe, just maybe, you're jel?
"
17,10,Wendy,"I'm not ""jel"", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school!
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh that may be true, but there is a very fine line, Wendy, between being a feminist and being a hater, mkay? And you're gonna have to find that line because nobody likes a girl who's jelly!
"
17,10,Mr. Garrison,"Okay kids, there have been some hurtful and hateful things being said around this school, and so we are gonna hear from a guest speaker. Here to explain why Kim Kardashian is not a hobbit, please welcome, Aquaman. 
"
17,10,Kanye,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh, that's right
"
17,10,Cartman,"Uh oh.
"
17,10,Kanye,"Okay, first of all, I am NOT Aquaman, I am a recovering... gay fish. Yes, I have met Aquaman. I have hung out with Aquaman. But the only thing I have in common with Aquaman anymore is my love for the sea.  Now!  There have been malicious rumors, started at this elementary school, that my beautiful fiancée is a hobbit. That is not funny, and it is not true.  Alright?! Yes, Kim is heavier than most of her pictures show her to be. Yes, she gets her hair lasered off her body. Yes, she has a friend named Gandalf who happens to be a wizard.  I'm sorry, excuse me a minute.  Bitch, how are you not a hobbit again? Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah right. Rightrightrightrightright, yeah. Okay. Yep. Yep. Let me get- okay. Yep, I got it. Okay, love you too.  Okay, if my fiancée Kim… is… a hobbit, then how come… it uh how c- then, okay, if she's a hobbit, then how come she don't live in a hole in the ground? BOOOOOOM! All y'all just got lit up, cuz! She don't live in no hole in the ground, she lives in a big-ass mansion, with me, in her room, that is slightly below ground! So, you can… She, she is sexy, and womanly, and she smokes a pipe. She can blow them rings that go up over her head, and… Hold up. Bitch, you not a hobbit, right? ... No, I know, you just, you smoke that long pipe sometimes when you sit by the fire... Oh it's a- Oh, okay. Got it, got it- What do you call it? Yep. Yep, got it. Okay. Yep, love you too.  That is not a hobbit pipe, for your information! It is a personal oral humidifier to keep all the wrinkles around her mouth from showin'. So haha, all you haters, HA!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Butters. Butters, come here for a sec.
"
17,10,Butters,"Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?
"
17,10,Butters,"Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 
"
17,10,Wendy,"I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?
"
17,10,Butters,"Okay.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides . We select the eyes , make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin , lengthen the neck , add more to the hair , select the lips and make them fuller , take out any puffiness on the skin  here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin , streamline the shoulders , put highlights in the eyes , and, there.
"
17,10,Butters,"That's Lisa Berger?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Do you see what I'm talking about?
"
17,10,Butters,"She's pretty!
"
17,10,Wendy,"That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.
"
17,10,Butters,"Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
"
17,10,Wendy,"What? What do you mean?
"
17,10,Butters,"And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 
"
17,10,Wendy,"Butters!
"
17,10,Butters,"Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
"
17,10,Cartman,"I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
"
17,10,Butters,"II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
"
17,10,Cartman,"Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
"
17,10,Butters,"What?! Well since when?
"
17,10,Cartman,"Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. 
"
17,10,Clyde,"Hey Token. Token, check out my girlfriend. 
"
17,10,Token,"Wow, she's hot.
"
17,10,Clyde,"Yeah, we just started dating seriously.  You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek?
"
17,10,Tweek,"Oh man, you're a lucky guy.
"
17,10,Clyde,"Yeah, I know. 
"
17,10,Craig,"Hey Clyde. Nice score, dude.
"
17,10,Other boys,"Yeah.
"
17,10,Clyde,"Oh, thanks, guys. 
"
17,10,Jimmy,"Hey Stan, did you see Clyde's going out with Lisa B-b-Berger?
"
17,10,Stan,"Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.  She got really hot all of a sudden.
"
17,10,Jimmy,"Yeah. I wouldn't mind t-tah-t-tappin' that ass.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Excuse me!
"
17,10,Stan,"Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Why would I be jel?
"
17,10,Jimmy,"Well, y-you gotta admit, Lisa Berger is pretty hot, Wendy.
"
17,10,Wendy,"She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point!
"
17,10,Stan,"She looks pretty hot here.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! 
"
17,10,Clyde,"That's not very nice, Wendy.
"
17,10,Lisa,"What's your problem, Wendy?
"
17,10,Wendy,"I'm sorry. It's nothing personal, Lisa.
"
17,10,Lisa,"You're just a hater. Why don't you mind your own business instead of being jelly?
"
17,10,Wendy,"I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way!
"
17,10,Clyde,"It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. 
"
17,10,Lisa,"Thanks, babe.
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Now Wendy, I've tried to be patient with you 'cause you've always been a good student! M'kay?! But calling a little girl fat and ugly is NEVER n'kay!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that-
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"No! No excuses! You have a problem bein' jelly, Wendy! Okay?! Just maybe, I should have you sent off to jelly school!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Jelly school?
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"That's right! In fact, I'm gonna call the jelly school right now, okay?!  I'm sorry about this, but it's gone too far! I've had it! Hello, is this the jelly school?! ... Okay, I have a girl here who's extremely jelly! Uh, see if you can take her in for a few weeks! Okay, you're full? Okay, yeah, I guess she dodged a bullet this time, but she'd better watch her jelly behavior!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make.
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Yuh, you do? Okay, well I'm not actually on the phone with a... jelly school, Wendy, okay?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes.
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, well Wendy, I'm just tryin' to uh- Oh, bye, jelly school.  Uh, Wendy, I'm just tryin' to make you understand how serious it is when you lash out at other girls.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey, I will... change.
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"M-okay.
"
17,10,Host,"Ladies and Gentlemen, it my my honor to give the Person of the Year award to this year's winner, Pope Francis. 
"
17,10,Pope Francis,"Gracias, gracias, all of my children.
"
17,10,Kanye,"Alright hold up! Hold up! I'm sorry pope, but hold up! I just gotta say this! If my fiancée is a hobbit, then uh, Then what, bitch? Okay, yeah yeah  Okay, if she... was... ih if she is a hobbit, then, how come she don't turn blue when goblins are near?  Oh, you didn't think of that! Oh, I guess she's not a hobbit then! She must be a beautiful, sexy woman!
"
17,10,Pope Francis,"The hobbit doesn't turn blue around goblins, just his sword does.
"
17,10,Kanye,"Man, get the fuck out of here, you hobbit trivia bitch!  Who the fuck asked you?!  Nobody is talkin' any more shit about my woman! Alright?! She is gorgeous! If she was here, you could all see for yourselves how beautiful she is! But she can't be here because she has a movie comin' out on Friday, directed by Peter Jackson, called The Hobbit! Hold up.  Bitch, that movie you got comin' out is called The Hobbit? ... Yeah, but it- ... What? It's what? Ohhh yeah. Yup. Yeah, I got it. Yup. Yup. Lemme tell them. Love you too.  Kim is not even in that movie! That movie is just loosely based on her television show, Keepin' Up With The Kardashians, which is a show about short, loud, little people living in a fantasy world! Hold. Up! Bitch, if you're the hobbit, you need to let me know right now, 'cause I'm makin' a fool of myself out here!

17,10,Red,"Look, Wendy, we are all very happy for Lisa, okay? Nobody here is jelly. But the boys aren't even noticing the rest of us anymore.
"
17,10,Bebe,"All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.
"
17,10,Wendy,"I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!
"
17,10,Heidi,"Why?! Don't you care about us?!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! 
"
17,10,Lisa,"Hey girls.  Don't be sad. If you wanna look really hot, like me, you just gotta be willing to sweat. Get down to the gym and work!
"
17,10,Coach,"Alright girls, we're gonna trim that fat and tone those bodies. Let's do this! You first!  Get right up there!  Alright, now look here.  Come on, burn it off! You got this!

17,10,Butters,"No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
"
17,10,Kyle,"Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
"
17,10,Cartman,"Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
"
17,10,Butters,"I do love water balloons. 
"
17,10,Stan,"Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
"
17,10,Wendy,"What?
"
17,10,Stan,"A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
"
17,10,Wendy,"So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!
"
17,10,Stan,"Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.
"
17,10,Stan,"I do? 
"
17,10,Wendy,"Yeah.  And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders.  The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nicole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair.  And Heidi Turner's butt is flat!  Oh God damn it!
"
17,10,Bebe,"You! HATER!
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"WENDY, IN MY OFFICE, RIGHT NOW! OKAY?!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Ugh!
"
17,10,Kanye (backup singers),"(Oh yeah, babe. Oh yeah, baby.)
One thing I know, my girl ain't no hobbit.
She might be stumpy; that don't mean she a hobbit.
She's not a hobbit 'cause she couldn't be.
She got no Bagginses in her family tree.
Yes on occasion she hangs out with her dwarf friends.
But she never went on no quest with her dwarf friends.
Except for one time she went to kill that dragon.
She took his gold and she- 
Hang on a minute, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Bitch, remember when you went off to kill that dragon with them dwarves? ... Yeah. Oh yeah. Rightrightrightright, yup. Yup, I got it. Yep, love you too. 
It wasn't no dragon, so my girl ain't no hobbit.
That was a Quizno's and my bitch went to rob it.
'Cause they got that ham that she robs on her cellulite.
While she drinking her grog and singin' those merry songs... at night...
My girl ain't no hobbit.
Please God, tell me I'm not engaged to no hobbit. 
(Kim is not a hobbit.)

17,10,"Red, Annie","Ugh.
"
17,10,Bebe,"Can we try this without Wendy?
"
17,10,Lola,"I agree!
"
17,10,Lisa,"Hey, come on, you guys. She just needs more confidence.  It's okay, Wendy. Who care if no one likes you? Maybe you should go out with Butters.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Let's just get back to cheering, okay?!
"
17,10,Heidi,"I don't think so! We don't wanna cheer with a hater!
"
17,10,Bebe,"Yeah! You have a bad self-image, Wendy! You need to go down to the gym and get a better one!
"
17,10,Annie,"Yeah!
"
17,10,Lola,"Uh huh!
"
17,10,Red,"That's right!
"
17,10,Wendy,"See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit! This has gone way too far!  And if society won't fix it, I will!
"
17,10,Bebe,"What are you gonna do?!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Something that should have been done a long time ago! 
"
17,10,Announcer,"It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson.
"
17,10,Tammy,"A little girl is making big waves with her fight against Photoshop.
"
17,10,Tom,"Nine-year-old Wendy Testaburger has started a campaign, and tomorrow will speak before the state senate to ban the use of Photoshopped images, saying they're harmful to young girls.  Young lady, what is your message?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.
"
17,10,Tom,"And you're not just... being a hater.
"
17,10,Wendy,"...Nooo.
"
17,10,Tom,"'Cause sometimes, girls who aren't well-liked, you know, lash out at pretty and popular girls. Are, are you well-liked at your school?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Not lately, no.
"
17,10,Tom,"Uh huh. But you're not being jelly?
"
17,10,Wendy,"NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!
"
17,10,Tom,"Okay, because I do understand that the jelly school in Aurora is ready to take you in. Is that right, Rick?
"
17,10,Rick,"Tom, I'm standing in front of the jelly school, where officials claim they do have room for this little hater girl. We're being told if she doesn't stop the-
"
17,10,Wendy,"That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts!
"
17,10,Rick,"Well, okay, but, you are a hater.
"
17,10,Wendy,"That's fine!  People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Agh! What do you want?
"
17,10,Kanye,"Once upon a time, there was a little hobbit who lived in the forest. And all the hobbit ever wanted was to be beautiful. And even though she was short and fat and hairy, this little hobbit dreamed that one day she could be pretty like Beyoncé.  And then one day, along came a magic power, called Photoshop. And just like that, poof, the little hobbit was beautiful. And even though she still couldn't sing like Beyoncé, or dance like Beyoncé, or act like Beyoncé, or be a decent human being like Beyoncé, the little hobbit was looked up to and loved, just like Beyoncé!  Soon she had money, and adoration, and a hip-hop fiancée who loved her very much-  I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up, I'm sorry.  Everything was good for the hobbit. But then this mean little girl, called the Jelly Monster, she was sooo jelly of the hobbit that she told everyone she was a liar, and the hobbit's fiancée realized she was just a hobbit. And you know what he said? He said ""I don't CARE!"" And then the jelly monster came and tried to take the magic power away from the little hobbit, so the hobbit prayed to God, and God said ""Don't worry, little hobbit. I will go find this jelly monster girl, and I will read her a story and melt her icy heart."" And the hobbit said ""Thank you,"" and the hobbit and God lived happily ever after in the shower forever 'cause I love her so much!  I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up. Hold up. I'm sorry.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly.
"
17,10,Kanye,"Sorry, hold up, I'm sorry, it's okay. Hold up, hold on, I'm sorry.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Nono, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry.
"
17,10,Kanye,"Sorry, sorry, that's okay. I've been jelly before too. I'm sorry.
