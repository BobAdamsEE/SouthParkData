16,1,Stan,"Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! 
"
16,1,Betsy,"Clyde! Clyde! Clyde, get up here! Hurry! 
"
16,1,Betsy,"What is that?
"
16,1,Clyde,"A toilet?
"
16,1,Betsy,"That's right. It's a toilet, Clyde. And where is the toilet seat? It's up, because you left it up, again! We've been through this countless times, Clyde.
"
16,1,Clyde,"Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?
"
16,1,Betsy,"No, not okay. Because you aren't getting the message! What if I'd fallen in? Start listening to me! Put it down! Put it down!  Thank you. 
"
16,1,Cartman,"Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
16,1,Kyle,"Is your mom always like that dude?
"
16,1,Clyde,"Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?
"
16,1,Cartman,"Of course, man. It's cool.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like ""Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! 
"
16,1,Kyle,"Cartman, it was actually really lame.
"
16,1,Cartman,"I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
"
16,1,Butters,"Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
"
16,1,Betsy,"Clyde! Clyde!  There you are!
"
16,1,Clyde,"Mom?
"
16,1,Betsy,"Clyde Donovan, you come home this instant!
"
16,1,Clyde,"Why?
"
16,1,Betsy,"What have I told you about putting the toilet seat down after you go to the bathroom?
"
16,1,Clyde,"Mom, I'm in class.
"
16,1,Betsy,"How many times do I have to tell you Clyde? I was trying to get ready for work and the toilet seat was up, again.
"
16,1,Roger,"Betsy, come back home. It's just not that big a deal.
"
16,1,Betsy,"No, Roger! It's a disgusting habit and I'm sick and tired of it. If I had sat down, I would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina.
"
16,1,Butters,"My grandma is from Virginia. 
"
16,1,Betsy,"You're coming home right now, and you're putting the seat down where it belongs. Let's go.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
"
16,1,Kyle,"I know, fatass. I was there.
"
16,1,Cartman,"His mom... His mom goes: ""Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay.""
"
16,1,Kyle,"That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
"
16,1,Cartman,"I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
16,1,Kyle,"Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
"
16,1,Cartman,"Nuh-uh.
"
16,1,Kyle,"Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 
"
16,1,Kyle,"What's going on?
"
16,1,Stan,"They are trying to save Clyde's mom.
"
16,1,Kyle,"From what?
"
16,1,Cartman,"They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
"
16,1,Fireman 1,"Hang it there. You're going to be fine okay? Stay with me now. 
"
16,1,Fireman 2,"I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.
"
16,1,Roger,"What?!
"
16,1,Fireman 2,"When she fell into the toilet, she also made it flush. It created a suction that's literally pulling out her insides.
"
16,1,Roger,"Can't we disconnect the toilet from the plumbing?
"
16,1,Paramedic,"Yes, we'll have to, but when we do that the change in pressure will rip out her organs.
"
16,1,Clyde,"But she's not gonna die, is she?
"
16,1,Fireman 2,"Why did you leave the toilet seat up, son?
"
16,1,Betsy,"Clyde! Clyde!  Clyde, I want you to know I don't blame you for this. We should have been h-h-harder on you all those times you left the toilet seat up.
"
16,1,Clyde,"Mom, I'm sorry.
"
16,1,Betsy,"Shhh! Sh! I.. don't... have a lot of time, Clyde. Just please put the toilet seat down from now on for your sister's sake, please. Oh, God, please let me go. Let me go. Do it! Do it! Do it! 
"
16,1,Clyde,"Mom?
"
16,1,Stephen,"I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect.  What a tragedy she had to leave us so soon. But I'm sure Betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere, just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet. 
"
16,1,Linda,"I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard. 
"
16,1,Women,"Yeah, yes. That's right.
"
16,1,Man With Grey Hair,"Putting the toilet seat down isn't that hard. So is it too much to ask women to just look and put it down before they go plopping their butts blindly to the toilet bowl?
"
16,1,Woman With Brown Hair,"My God, people. This is a funeral! Please have some respect! There's a little boy here who has lost his mother!  He'll never see her again, because he couldn't take that sixth-tenths of a second to put the seat down when he was done peeing.  And now little Clyde's mother is dead, and the blood is on his penis. 
"
16,1,Terrance,"Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.
"
16,1,Phillip,"Oh, hello, Ugly Bob. 
"
16,1,Ugly Bob,"Hello Terrance. Hello Phillip.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Mom, get the door! 
"
16,1,Terrance,"You're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
"
16,1,Ugly Bob,"How come you guys say stuff like that?
"
16,1,Phillip,"Because you're goddamn ugly... 
"
16,1,TSA Agent 1,"Hello ma'am, we're the Toilet Safety Administration.
"
16,1,Liane,"The what?
"
16,1,TSA Agent 2,"After the recent tragedy, new safety regulations require us to check every toilet for security. Can we come in?
"
16,1,Liane,"Oh sure. 
"
16,1,Cartman,"Who are these buttholes?
"
16,1,Liane,"It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.
"
16,1,Cartman,"My potty? What are they going to do to it? 
"
16,1,Cartman,"Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! 
"
16,1,TSA Agent 1,"Oh yeah, we're gonna have to completely redo this ma'am.
"
16,1,Liane,"Oh.
"
16,1,TSA Agent 1,"You need to have this counter moved to a minimum of six inches, but we'll go ahead and install your safety belt.
"
16,1,Liane,"Safety belt?
"
16,1,TSA Agent 2,"Federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
"
16,1,TSA Agent 2,"This is for your safety. A woman died, you know.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
"
16,1,Kyle,"Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
"
16,1,Attorney,"Uh-uh, go on.
"
16,1,Stan,"We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
"
16,1,Kyle,"So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
"
16,1,Attorney,"You can always sue somebody.
"
16,1,Kyle,"All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
"
16,1,Attorney,"You got it.  Here we go, the inventor of the toilet.  Sir Thomas Harrington. In England, died in 1692.
"
16,1,Kyle,"Aw, he's dead?
"
16,1,Stan,"So then we can't sue him?
"
16,1,Attorney,"Why not? You can always sue somebody. It's just gonna take some special protocol. We would have to perform a sue-ance. 
"
16,1,Jimmy,"A...a...a...a sue-ance?
"
16,1,Attorney,"You bet. Here at Hoffman and Turk we specialize in suing the dead. If you hire us, we'll work hard, for you.
"
16,1,Stan,"Wow, really?!
"
16,1,Kyle,"You hear that Clyde?
"
16,1,Attorney,"Now look. I'll be asking all of you to have a very open mind and a willingness to face you fears.  I warn you boys. A sue-ance can be very... expensive.
"
16,1,Stan,"How expensive?
"
16,1,Attorney,"How much do you have?
"
16,1,Kyle,"Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
"
16,1,Attorney,"Wow! That's exactly how much a sue-ance costs. 
"
16,1,Jimmy,"Wow, that's weird.
"
16,1,Randy,"Aw, damn it.  He, hey officer.
"
16,1,Officer,"If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir.
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...
"
16,1,Officer,"The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos?
"
16,1,Randy,"Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!
"
16,1,Officer,"Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in.
"
16,1,Randy,"I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. 
"
16,1,Officer,"The law is the law sir.  You can pay this by mail or appear in court on that date. Have a good day, sir. 
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah thanks.  Asshole.
"
16,1,Officer,"You say something?
"
16,1,Randy,"No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. 
"
16,1,Cartman,"This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
"
16,1,R. Booth,"Shoes off, belts off! Sharp objects go in the plastic tray!
"
16,1,Man 1,"This is inhumane.
"
16,1,R. Booth,"Shut up! Sir.
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"Taking a dump today, ma'am?
"
16,1,Woman 2,"No, just need to pee.
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"I'll just need to check inside your aaasshole. 
"
16,1,Cartman,"Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"All right, do you mind if I touch your balls, sir?
"
16,1,Cartman,"What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
"
16,1,Gerald,"Okay, I'm done.
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"Alright, sir. I just need to check inside your aaasshole. 
"
16,1,Gerald,"I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"Yes, you're a big boy, aren't you, sir?
"
16,1,Gerald,"Yeah, I'm a big boy.
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"That's a big boy, sir.
"
16,1,Gerald,"I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"Yes.
"
16,1,Attorney,"Alright boys, sit down and clear your minds. The sue-ance is about to begin. Doors and windows are locked. You boys have your $500 in cash ready?
"
16,1,Stan,"Yeah.
"
16,1,Attorney,"Alright. Then I've got this big bowl set here to catch all money we're about to make. Now. Let us start.  We call out to the land of the dead. Sir John Harrington. Your presence is requested. Appear to us, John Harrington. We have a subpoena.
"
16,1,Jimmy,"Jeez, it's not working.
"
16,1,Attorney,"John Harrington. My client is due compensation for negligence.  What is your name, spirit?
"
16,1,Spirit,"Burns. Jimmy Burns. What's it to you? Who are you, mugs?
"
16,1,Attorney,"That's how people talked in the past.  We have a claim against a John Harrington. Do you know him, spirit?
"
16,1,Burns,"Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't. Might need a little something to jar my memory.
"
16,1,Attorney,"We gotta grease him. Put a hundred in the box. 
"
16,1,Burns,"Oh yeah, Harrington. I know him. Always going round inventing things.
"
16,1,Attorney,"Yes, that's him. Is his personage amongst you?
"
16,1,Burns,"Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn't.
"
16,1,Attorney,"Give him another hundred. 
"
16,1,Burns,"Yeah, I've seen him around, alright. He was just down that way, bragging about some porcelain machine and whatever. 
"
16,1,Spirit 2,"Nooo! Nooooo!
"
16,1,Attorney,"By the power of Christ, we sue you!  By the power of Christ, we sue you!
"
16,1,Spirit 2,"You can't sue me! 
"
16,1,Attorney,"Quick, put the other $300 in the box!  This actually went really, really well. Always happens some bureaucrat tries to block the first sue-ance attempt, but this was good. We'll get him tomorrow.
"
16,1,Clyde,"So that's it?
"
16,1,Attorney,"Yeah, we're gonna need about 400 more dollars tomorrow. I know you're sad about your mom, Clyde, but don't worry. We're going to win this thing.
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"Put your coffee in the plastic tray please, sir.
"
16,1,R. Booth,"Shoes off. Belts off.
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah yeah.
"
16,1,R. West,"Got any metal in your pockets?
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"I just need to check your asshole.
"
16,1,Randy,"So ridiculous.
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"Asshole clear.
"
16,1,Randy,"Thanks.
"
16,1,R. West,"Pick your coffee up, sir. 
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"Anyways, he says I'm getting nothing anyway, so then you can...
"
16,1,Randy,"Hey, what's that thing? 
"
16,1,R. Wiley,"That's a camera. It's a security camera.
"
16,1,Randy,"Aw, you people have me on camera now?
"
16,1,R. West,"It's okay, sir. There's just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
"
16,1,People,"Yeah.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
"
16,1,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, yeah. If there's no toilet seats, the government can't make toilet seat laws. 
"
16,1,Jimbo,"Alright, let's do it.
"
16,1,Sheila,"No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.
"
16,1,Man 3,"No, we won't.
"
16,1,Woman 3,"Yeah, you will.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
"
16,1,Woman 4,"How about we agree to that, if men will agree that they will always sit down to urinate.
"
16,1,Stephen,"Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat?
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?
"
16,1,Man 4,"What about us loggers? Hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine?
"
16,1,Cartman,"Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
"
16,1,Man 4,"But folks been logging round these parts for generations. My pappy taught me logging. And his pappy before him.
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. 
"
16,1,Attorney,"Oh, oohh! The spirits of the dead are looking over the subpoena. Motion for summary judgement on behalf of the plaintiff? Ah, aaaah!
"
16,1,Jimmy,"What's happening now?
"
16,1,Attorney,"Our motion has been denied by the judge.  Concentrate boys!  This specter is like none I have ever encountered. I managed to avert liability within injunction against out claim.
"
16,1,Stan,"So what does that mean?
"
16,1,Attorney,"We'll hit him with a class action lawsuit tomorrow. We'll need all your friends and family to sign a petition and kick in 50 bucks each.
"
16,1,Kyle,"What?
"
16,1,Attorney,"Hang in there, Clyde. This is all to make the world a safer place.
"
16,1,Monitor Man,"Security breeeach!
"
16,1,Reporter,"An embarrassing day for the toilet safety administration. Shocking outrage ensued after an unknown terrorist managed to get through TSA security with a gun and a baby. Leaving the toilet seat up. The head TSA chief of operations had this to say:
"
16,1,R. West,"Shiiiit!
"
16,1,Reporter,"Meanwhile, outraged civilians are claiming they're finally fed up with the overblown government bureaucracy.
"
16,1,Randy,"What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
"
16,1,Woman 5,"And the toilet seat was up.
"
16,1,Randy,"We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
"
16,1,Cartman,"That's right.
"
16,1,Randy,"Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
16,1,Randy,"It is time for us all to grow up.
"
16,1,Cartman,"That's right.
"
16,1,Randy,"It is time for a sue-ance.
"
16,1,People,"Yeah.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
"
16,1,Reporter 2,"Tom, I'm standing outside the South Park courthouse where experts have successfully summoned the ghost of toilet inventor Sir John Harrington. Now that the spirit has crossed over from the dead, lawyers are gonna try and sue him.
"
16,1,Attorney,"Sir Thomas Harrington, your extreme negligence has cost tax payers millions.
"
16,1,Spirit,"No! No!
"
16,1,Attorney,"You will be sued, spirit. Thy liability is without question.  Appear before this court, Harrington.
"
16,1,Spirit,"Never!
"
16,1,Attorney,"Quick, everyone, get our all your money. 
"
16,1,Betsy,"Clyde? Clyde?
"
16,1,Clyde,"Mom?
"
16,1,Betsy,"This lawyer is a fraud. He has been swindling you and your friends for your money.
"
16,1,Attorney,"Fuck me, it's a ghost.
"
16,1,Betsy,"You can't sue the dead, Clyde. Putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette. It's common sense, Clyde!
"
16,1,Cartman,"Oh boy, here we go.
"
16,1,Betsy,"Don't try and blame mommy's death on anything but your failure to something I have asked you time and time again to do.  It's your fault!
"
16,1,Spirit 2,"Now hold on a second! It's not anyone's fault.  I am sick an tired of all this nonsense over my porcelain toilet machine.
"
16,1,P. Sanchez,"There he is, Sir John Harrington.
"
16,1,Mr. Garrison,"Quick, sue him!
"
16,1,Sir Harrington,"You can't sue me.  You're all using my toilet invention the wrong way.  When you have to sit and take a Sir Harrington you're supposed to be facing this way.  So you can use the little shelf for your books, and your quill and your ink.
"
16,1,Butters,"A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
"
16,1,Sir Harrington,"Why would I design it so that when you're finished taking a Sir Harrington, you have to stand up, turn around and look right down at your Harrington to flush. That's gross.
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.
"
16,1,Sir Harrington,"Of course! Why do you think I designed toilet rooms with a laundry hole? 
"
16,1,Randy,"That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.
"
16,1,Cartman,"So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like ""Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!"" And Clyde is all like ""Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!"" Dude, it was a riot.
"
16,1,Clyde,"That's not what I said.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
"
16,1,Cartman,"Clyde, you there? Hello? 
"
16,2,Randy,"Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.
"
16,2,Sharon,"What?! Randy!
"
16,2,Randy,"Just trying to leave without being rude.
"
16,2,Marvin,"Hold on, hold on just a second. I got a present for my grandson.  Come here, Billy.  You've grown up, Billy. It's time for you to have somethin' expensive and flashy , to impress all the ladies .
"
16,2,Sharon,"Go ahead and open it, Stan.  Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? 
"
16,2,Marvin,"That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds.
"
16,2,Randy,"Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?
"
16,2,Marvin,"Six thousand dollars.
"
16,2,Randy,"Six thousand?!
"
16,2,Marvin,"It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.
"
16,2,Randy,"Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!
"
16,2,Sharon,"It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!
"
16,2,Marvin,"Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?
"
16,2,Cartman,"Nice bolo tie, Stan.
"
16,2,Stan,"Thanks. 
"
16,2,Cartman,"Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one.
"
16,2,Stan,"Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
"
16,2,Cartman,"No, dude, it's... badass.
"
16,2,Stan,"It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
"
16,2,Kyle,"That... was six grand?
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
"
16,2,Cartman,"...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
"
16,2,Stan,"I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!
"
16,2,Kyle,"Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says ""Cash For Gold and Jewelry."" There must be a lot of people doin' it.
"
16,2,Clerk 1,"You didn't steal this, did you?
"
16,2,Stan,"No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
"
16,2,Clerk 1,"It's 14-karat gold, diamond and turquoise. I'll give you fifteen dollars.
"
16,2,Stan,"...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
"
16,2,Clerk 1,"Yeah, I can't really make anything on the diamonds. I'd have to send it to a smelter, have it all smelted down for the gold, probably could make a ten-dollar profit.
"
16,2,Stan,"Fifteen bucks?!
"
16,2,Kyle,"Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"You may suck our collective balls, sir! 
"
16,2,Kyle,"Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah! Here's one. 
"
16,2,Clerk 2,"These are real diamonds, right?
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah dude, you can test them.
"
16,2,Clerk 2,"Okay. Eight dollars.
"
16,2,Stan,"This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
"
16,2,Clerk 2,"Nine dollars.
"
16,2,Clerk 3,"Welcome to Taco Bell. Would you like to try our Doritos Locos Tacos?
"
16,2,Stan,"I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. 
"
16,2,Clerk 3,"Fourteen-karat gold gets yaaa $14 a gram on the open market, got about... 4 grams here...  It's not really worth my time. I guess I can give you a six-layer burrito for it.
"
16,2,Stan,"A six-layer burrito?
"
16,2,Kyle,"You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
"
16,2,Clerk 3,"Alright, a seven-layer burrito! But that's as high as I'm going!
"
16,2,Stan,"Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
"
16,2,Dean,"Okay, folks, we are com-, half-way complete with today's broadcast.  You wanna get in on these deals, call now. Next item is... This is item number 4 5 7 8 1 1 1.

I believe we have a sale? Do we have a sale? Yea- let's get her on the line. Hello? Who am I speakin' with?
"
16,2,Vivian,"Hello... my name is... Vivian.
"
16,2,Dean,"Vivian, you just got a heck of a deal. What's your last name, sweetheart?
"
16,2,Vivian,"Oh I... I can't remember.
"
16,2,Dean,"You can't remember. Well can you remember your credit card number?
"
16,2,Vivian,"3 7 1 5-
"
16,2,Dean,"Hold on, Vivivan, we'll get you on with a rep, take down that number. Thanks for shoppin' with us and congratulations on the lovely 14 karat gold sapphire earrings. At that price you practically stole them from us. Ouch. Okay-
"
16,2,Kyle,"Dude, that's terrible!
"
16,2,Cartman,"I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
"
16,2,Stan,"But, how do they get away with that?
"
16,2,Cartman,"This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. 
"
16,2,Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
16,2,Cartman,"For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. 
"
16,2,Kyle,"That's the chemical equation for gold?
"
16,2,Cartman,"That's right.  Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. 
"
16,2,Kyle,"...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
"
16,2,Kenny,"(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)
"
16,2,Cartman,"Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
"
16,2,Dean,"Oh my gosh, can you believe this? Somebody's about to get this $20,000 topaz and copper ring for just four thousand bucks.  We've got our buyer on the line. You buyin' this as a gift, sir?
"
16,2,Caller,"No, I'm buying it as a gift! For my grandson Billy!
"
16,2,Stan,"Grandpa? 
"
16,2,Dean,"How about that, folks? That is Brazilian emerald, finest emerald available. We're letting this oen go fer... fourteen ninety five , EZ Pay. We call it that to save you time. EZ is an abbreviation of easy. Fourteen ninety five, EZ Pay an... What's that? Okay, alright, I just got word, we are droppin' the Z from EZ Pay. It's now just E Pay.  By usin' the word E Pay instead of takin' all that time to say EZ Pay, we're savin' you a second of time, and those seconds add up. Go ahead and try it: say E Pay five thousand times. That's five thousand seconds, nine hours... we just saved you here on J&G Shoppin' Network.  Not wastin' your time here, you can't afford not to buy this one. You don't have a lot of time left. Literally. Pass this one down to your kids, your grandkids.  Show 'em your life had meaning.
"
16,2,Stan,"Grandpa.
"
16,2,Marvin,"Well you see that, Billy? That's an emerald on 14 karat gold. Don't you think your sister would like that? 
"
16,2,Stan,"She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa.
"
16,2,Marvin,"Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all.
"
16,2,Stan,"She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen.
"
16,2,Marvin,"Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy...  Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?
"
16,2,Stan,"Yes, Grandpa.
"
16,2,Marvin,"I loved that dog. She always made me so happy. When she died, I... I didn't let myself get too sad, 'cause I thought, thought I'd always have the memory of her slobberin' happy face.  I can't remember what she looked like, Billy... Huh. Huohh. 
"
16,2,Stan,"Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
"
16,2,Butters,"Whoops! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"Butters, what the fuck?!
"
16,2,Butters,"Sorry. My arms hurt.
"
16,2,Cartman,"""My arms hurt."" Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! 
"
16,2,Leroy,"Hey! How much will you give me for this? 
"
16,2,Cartman,"Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
"
16,2,Leroy,"Okay. 
"
16,2,Cartman,"We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
"
16,2,Dean,"And that's it, we just sold this bracelet to Ms. Marcia Tubbs. Martha, thank you so much for your call. You just got yourself a heck of a deal on this one. You there Marcia?
"
16,2,Marcia,"Yes.  I'm lost. I'm lost walkin' on the freeway.
"
16,2,Dean,"Alright, you're lost walkin' on the freeway? Enjoy the Tiger's Eye Aquamarine bracelet. Alri- okay, what should we do next? Oh I see one. Here's a good'un. Lemme...  Lemme... lemme set the stage for you here: you're goin' to that seniors' cocktail party? It's bingo night and you're lookin' for somethin' to wear? How about a 13 carat panzoto-panzanite ring. This is-oh! We got a caller already on this one! Hello sir, you must be a fan of panzoto-panzanite.
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?
"
16,2,Dean,"...What's that?
"
16,2,Stan,"I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
"
16,2,Dean,"Okay, we're gonna sell this ring for just thirty-seven ninety five.  How's that? 
"
16,2,Stan,"I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
"
16,2,Dean,"Alright, well you shouldn't say things like that 'cause... some host of a jewelry channel sure might up and do it, and then you'd feel really bad.
"
16,2,Stan,"No i wouldn't.
"
16,2,Dean,"Yes you would.
"
16,2,Stan,"No, because I really want you to kill yourself.
"
16,2,Dean,"Alright, well how about this?! If a jewelry network host goes home tonight and blows the brains out, you might be liable. That's a lawsuit worth ...2.7 million dollars? How's that sound?
"
16,2,Stan,"I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
"
16,2,Dean,"Alright, I tell you what: I'll bring the lawsuit down to twenty-nine thirty-nine- 
"
16,2,Stan,"Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
"
16,2,Dean,"Well, you think it's funny, but that's, that's callin' up and tellin' someone to kill themselves; that's not a joke.
"
16,2,Stan,"I'm not joking.  Do it.
"
16,2,Cartman,"Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?
"
16,2,Caller,"Hello?
"
16,2,Cartman,"YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
"
16,2,Mrs. Appleby,"This is Mrs. Appleby on 24 Palmark Lane?
"
16,2,Cartman,"Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
"
16,2,Mrs. Appleby,"I'm sorry?
"
16,2,Cartman,"Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
"
16,2,Mrs. Appleby,"Thank you.
"
16,2,Cartman,"Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought ""Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!""
"
16,2,Mrs. Appleby,"...I thought it'd be a lovely gift for my granddaughter Jessica. She's captain of the debate team at Jefferson High School. see-
"
16,2,Cartman,"Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
"
16,2,Mrs. Appleby,"Goodbye.
"
16,2,Cartman,"Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
"
16,2,Stan,"Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
"
16,2,Manager,"Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places.
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: ""Whoever smelt it, dealt it!""
"
16,2,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
16,2,Kenny,"(Fuck yeah!)
"
16,2,Manager,"We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually ""Mayii nahii chahatapahnii""
"
16,2,Kyle,"What does that mean?
"
16,2,Manager,"""Whoever denied it,  supplied it."" 
"
16,2,Stan,"YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
"
16,2,Butters,"We aren't makin' that much, fellas.
"
16,2,Stan,"You're not?
"
16,2,Twirler 1,"Who don't you yell at the people who melt the gold down? The old Hindu saying is ""Whever smelt it dealt it"" 
"
16,2,Kyle,"Nuh uh! It's ""Whoever denied it, supplied it!""
"
16,2,Twirler 2,"You got it all wrong. The jewelry that those shopping networks sell don't even come from us! It's all made in India, where those Hindu rhymes come from!
"
16,2,Twirler 3,"What are you saying, Gustav? My God, do you mean?
"
16,2,Twirler 4,"That's right. Whoever made the rhyme did the crime.
"
16,2,Cartman,"Suck my balls, suck my balls...  Hello!
"
16,2,Clerk 4,"Ohhhh welcoooome! Welcome to discount jewelry stohhhhh! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.
"
16,2,Clerk 4,"Ohhhhh you so good foh biiiziness!  You so clehhvahh.
"
16,2,Cartman,"I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.
"
16,2,Clerk 4,"Okay, what emero do you rike?
"
16,2,Cartman,"Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.

16,2,Clerk 4,"Ohhhh you make so good chooice! Oh it's beauuutiful!  Look it's beauuutiful! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.
"
16,2,Clerk 4,"Oh, that's best one! You so clevohh!  You take advantage o'my low pricess! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
"
16,2,Clerk 4,"You got good eye,  You so clehhvahh. I getting taken advantaaage! You rike to fuck an Asian lady?
"
16,2,Cartman,"What d'ja say?
"
16,2,Clerk 4,"I know, you walk by my stoh and you say ""Oh, there's a nice Asian lady. I think I go in and I fuck hurh,"" you Asian-lady fucker you!
"
16,2,Cartman,"Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
"
16,2,Clerk 4,"Oh, I pay thousands! And you come heuh an' fuck me!
"
16,2,Cartman,"Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
"
16,2,Clerk 4,"Nono, you fucked me!
"
16,2,Cartman,"Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
"
16,2,Butters,"Oh sorry, sorry. 
"
16,2,Cartman,"You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!
"
16,2,Stan,"You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!
"
16,2,Butters,"Sorry! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
"
16,2,Kyle,"We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
"
16,2,Cartman,"No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
"
16,2,Stan,"Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! 
"
16,2,Kyle,"What's he doing?
"
16,2,Stan,"Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
"
16,2,Stan,"So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
"
16,2,Marvin,"Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend.
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. 
"
16,2,Marvin,"Oh, for me?  Oh! My God. There she is.  Old Patches. There's that slobberin' happy face! Thank you Billy. That means a lot.  Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing?
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah.
"
16,2,Marvin,"I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck.
"
16,2,Stan,"Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore.
"
16,2,Marvin,"That's a good idea. 
"
16,2,Dean,"Folks, these are not your ordinary peridot craponite earrings, these are 18-karat gold! and we got-oh, do we have a buyer on the line? Hello?
"
16,2,Caller 1,"What are you waiting for? Kill yourself.
"
16,2,Dean,"Alright Goddamnit, we got another comedian. Ever since that little kid called up, now everybody wants to call and tell me I should kill myself.
"
16,2,Caller 1,"He was right. Do it.
"
16,2,Dean,"Folks, this is an 800 number. Every time you call and tell me to kill myself, it's costing us... two dollars and thirty six cents! So now, how about a caller who wants to buy jewelry&#160;? Yes. Hello, sir?
"
16,2,Caller 2,"You're too scared to do it, aren't-cha? You don't have the balls.
"
16,2,Dean,"Goddamnit I'm not scared to do it.
"
16,2,Caller 2,"New, you're scared. You got, you got lady balls. 
"
16,2,Caller 3,"Hello? I'm calling about the peridot earrings?
"
16,2,Dean,"Yes ma'am!
"
16,2,Caller 3,"They'd look good on your dead body. Why don't you kill yourself?
"
16,2,Dean,"Alright, that's that! That there's the- the straw that broke the camel's back! I got a gun right here; whattaya think about that?!
"
16,2,Caller 3,"Put it against your temple and pull the trigger. 
"
16,3,Mitt,"I know the people are going to say, oh you should only practice it this way or that way.
"
16,3,Rick,"I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.
"
16,3,Newt,"What he said, which I find mildly amazing, was that he thought I would have a hard time debating Barack Obama.
"
16,3,Ron,"We faced something much much greater after World War II.  We had ten million coming home at once. What did we do then? Some liberals said we need more work programs-
"
16,3,Stan,"Tango, Tango, I'm in position.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?
"
16,3,Stan,"It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Alright, Butters. Bring it in.
"
16,3,Butters,"Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
"
16,3,Cartman,"I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
"
16,3,Agent 1,"We might have a problem.
"
16,3,Agent 2,"What's that?
"
16,3,Agent 1,"We just got word somebody might try to Faith Hill this event.
"
16,3,Agent 2,"Lock down the whole perimeter. Nobody is Faith Hilling, not on my watch! 
"
16,3,Stan,"I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.
"
16,3,Agent 3,"Hey, somebody is under the stage.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Go Cartman! 
"
16,3,Butters,"We got it. We got it!
"
16,3,Stan,"Go, go, go.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. 
"
16,3,Reporter,"First, there was planking.  People taking pictures of themselves in a planked position and putting the photos on the Internet. Planking was soon replaced by owling.  And after the super bowl by bradying.  But the newest meme involves pulling the shirt out to look like boobs.  It's called Faith Hilling. And all around the world people are doing it.  Kids, adults, and even notable celebrities are getting into the act.  But as Faith Hilling is more and more popular, the question on everyone's mind, who will be the first to die doing it?
"
16,3,Lamont,"I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire!  Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of bradying. From football quarterback to football singer.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.
"
16,3,Lamont,"I know you all think what you're doing is new and hip and cool. But the truth is memeing has been around a long time. We're gonna watch a film strip now, that's a little dated but I think it gets the point across. 
"
16,3,Speaker,"For many young people today taking pictures in silly poses becomes a dangerous past time. The latest meme has also become the most deadly. It's called tebowing.
"
16,3,Speaker,"This is Ryan and Barkley. They're about to learn how dangerous tebowing can be.
"
16,3,Ryan,"Here is a good place. I'll do it right here.
"
16,3,Barkley,"I don't know, Ryan, you sure this is a good idea? 
"
16,3,Ryan,"Stop being a scaredy-cat. It will just take a second, how could I get hurt? 
"
16,3,Barkley,"Okay, hold still.  What's that?
"
16,3,Ryan,"A traaain! AAAAAA!
"
16,3,Barkley,"RYAN!
"
16,3,Ryan,"No, no! Nooo! No, no, no, no, noooo! 
"
16,3,Barkley,"Ryan!
"
16,3,Ryan,"Learn from me. 
"
16,3,Woman 1,"This sure is a nice car, Tommy.  Would you like to get a picture of me tebowing in it?
"
16,3,Tommy,"Sure.  What is that?
"
16,3,Woman 1,"Oh my God, it's coming!
"
16,3,Tommy,"God no!  No, no!
"
16,3,Woman 1,"Tommy, d-did you get the picture?
"
16,3,Tommy,"Hold on, wait, hold on! 
"
16,3,Woman 1,"Hurry, hurry! AAAAA!  Eeeaaah! 
"
16,3,Man 1,"Be careful up there, Pete.
"
16,3,Pete,"Just go on and take the picture. 
"
16,3,Speaker,"These youths paid with their lives for tebowing. When they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes: peace signs , bunny ears  and fake wiener  Maybe you think this doesn't apply to you, maybe you think your memes are safe. Or maybe you're watching this in the future and tebowing has been replaced by some other meme. Well, if you are watching his in the future,  get off your flying cellphone scooters and THINK. Just remember.  Use the approved poses if you want to be a memer. Peace signs, bunny ears, and fake wieners. 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Oh, God. That was boring.
"
16,3,Kenny,"(Totally!)
"
16,3,Kyle,"So, what do you want to do now?
"
16,3,Cartman,"Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
"
16,3,Stan,"Oh, that's a good idea.
"
16,3,Butters,"What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
"
16,3,Cartman,"Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
"
16,3,Butters,"Well, count me out.
"
16,3,Kyle,"You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
"
16,3,Butters,"Well, I'm scared. 
"
16,3,Craig,"Hey, did you see today's newspaper?
"
16,3,Cartman,"Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
"
16,3,Craig,"You guys made the front page.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Really? 
"
16,3,Stan,"Dude, we are on the front page!
"
16,3,Cartman,"Yes!
"
16,3,Kenny,"(Yeah, dude!)
"
16,3,Stan,"Can we get a different pose, please? 
"
16,3,Cartman,"What's it say, what's it say?
"
16,3,Stan,"It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
"
16,3,Cartman,"What? Let me see that. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"How can that be? Already?
"
16,3,Stan,"Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
"
16,3,Kyle,"How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
"
16,3,Stan,"""Faith Hilling is pretty stale,"" said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. ""If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive.""
"
16,3,Cartman,"Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
"
16,3,Stan,"That's all it is? 
"
16,3,Cartman,"You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
"
16,3,Cartman,"I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys.
"
16,3,Boy 1,"Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. 
"
16,3,Cartman,"How is this Kyle? This good? 
"
16,3,Kyle,"Yep, that's great. 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Cool, these will be good uploads.
"
16,3,Boy 2,"Hey, what are you doing?
"
16,3,Cartman,"Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
"
16,3,Boy 1,"Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.
"
16,3,Stan,"Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
"
16,3,Boy 2,"Come on guys. It's not worth it. We can do our Taylor Swifting somewhere else.   Knock it off!
"
16,3,Cartman,"Why don't you make me? 
"
16,3,Lamont,"Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe.  Faith Hilling, Taylor Swifting. These are things that will get you killed!  That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up.
"
16,3,Butters,"Oh, that's okay. I think...
"
16,3,Lamont,"Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point?
"
16,3,Kids,"Yes, sir.
"
16,3,Lamont,"Good. Now put the gun in your mouth.
"
16,3,Butters,"HA?!
"
16,3,Lamont,"Hey! You're following plankers and tebowers, so put a loaded gun in your mouth! DO IT!  Everybody take a good look.  This is what you're doing every time you play with Internet memes. You're playing roulette with your lives! 
"
16,3,Man 2,"Professor Lamont, we need to talk.
"
16,3,Lamont,"I will be right back. 
"
16,3,Man 2,"You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont.
"
16,3,Lamont,"Yes, what is this about? 
"
16,3,Man 3,"We need your expertise, sir.
"
16,3,Man 2,"Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?
"
16,3,Lamont,"Another species? What are you talking about?
"
16,3,Man 3,"We were hoping perhaps you could help us understand...  this.  Cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the Internet, with bread around their heads. Cat breading, it's called. It's just such an odd thing to do, we thought would you explain it to us.
"
16,3,Lamont,"They're evolving. Cats are evolving. 
"
16,3,Man 3,"Sorry?
"
16,3,Lamont,"There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt.
"
16,3,Man 2,"We're having a hard time following you here.
"
16,3,Lamont,"Look. In the 70s there was fonzing.  Which replaced the outdated mustaching.  In the 60s cultural ideas were passed on by everybody poodle-fisting.  But even that evolved from people ass wedging in the 40s.  Even before photographs humans memed for portraits. All the way back to the Egyptians who had pictures painted of themselves donkey ticking. 
"
16,3,Man 2,"You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?
"
16,3,Lamont,"If they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures,  they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are. 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!
"
16,3,Stan,"Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
"
16,3,Cartman,"I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
"
16,3,Stan,"That's a cool idea
"
16,3,Kenny,"(Oh, fuck it, dude.) 
"
16,3,Kyle,"W-what's the matter, Kenny?
"
16,3,Kenny,"(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)
"
16,3,Stan,"What seems pointless?
"
16,3,Kenny,"(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
"
16,3,Kyle,"Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
"
16,3,Kenny,"(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)
"
16,3,Stan,"No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
"
16,3,Reporter,"Two Boulder children died today while Oh Long Johnsoning in a battling cage. Oh Long Johnsonning is of course the latest Internet meme which involves putting oneself in a risky situation and then seeing how many times you can say ""Oh Long Johnson"" on video before getting out of the way.
"
16,3,Boy 3,"You ready, you ready?
"
16,3,Boy 4,"I'm recording, go.
"
16,3,Boy 3,"Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. O-Oh Long- 
"
16,3,Boy 4,"Larry!
"
16,3,Reporter,"This latest Internet meme is shocking. But most shocking of all is the person who started the meme isn't a person at all, but a cat who seems to have no regard for people's safety.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Reporter,"The cat is now under arrest and awaiting trial for its part in the teenager's death.
"
16,3,Stan,"Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Boy 1,"Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way.
"
16,3,Stan,"Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long- 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Dude, what's going on?
"
16,3,Stan,"Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? 
"
16,3,Kyle,"We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
"
16,3,Boy 1,"He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff.
"
16,3,Stan,"Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
"
16,3,Kyle,"Benedict Arnold. 
"
16,3,Stan,"Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"Kenny?
"
16,3,Kenny,"(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)
"
16,3,Boy 1,"If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home. 
"
16,3,Stan,"You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"You guys are sellouts.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Come on, Kyle.
"
16,3,Kyle,"You're freaking sellouts!
"
16,3,Cartman,"It's okay, man, come on.
"
16,3,Lamont,"What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you have any idea when you play with memes you're playing with fire? 
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Lamont,"Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want?
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Jeeea-
"
16,3,Lamont,"You cats want a war? Because that's what you're going to get!
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh oh oh.
"
16,3,Reporter 2,"Long ago there was tebowing, which evolved into Faith Hilling. But the latest memeing craze, Swift-Johnsoning, may now also have its rival.  A brand new meme, where people video themselves wearing trench coats and talking about the dangers of memeing. They call it ""reporting"". And safety officials say that it's dangerous and potentially fatal.  Oh! Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 
"
16,3,Little Boy,"What are those boys doing, daddy?
"
16,3,Dad,"Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time.
"
16,3,Little Boy,"How droll. 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Get a couple facing the other way, brah. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"Yeah, good idea. 
"
16,3,Doctor,"Hey, you kids Faith Hilling in front of my clinic? 'Cause I got a couple of patients in here that could use a good time machine.  Get it? 
"
16,3,Man 4,"Go back to the 90s! Faggooots!
"
16,3,Kyle,"We have to face it, Cartman.
"
16,3,Cartman,"I know. I know Kyle. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"I really thought it was gonna last.
"
16,3,Cartman,"I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
"
16,3,Cartman,"No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
"
16,3,Kyle,"I-It's good that it became something else.
"
16,3,Cartman,"And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. 
"
16,3,Reporter,"Household cats have evolved into a species as intelligent as humans. Will this mean war between our two life forms? In an attempt to try and communicate with the leader of cats, experts have sent in the ambassador of people.
"
16,3,Ambassador,"Hello.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Ambassador,"Meow, meow.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Ambassador,"Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Ambassador,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh- Oh Don Piano.
"
16,3,Ambassador,"Oh Don Piano.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Ambassador,"Oh Don Piaaano.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Jon-Jon-Johnson.
"
16,3,Ambassador,"Oh lala lionde. Oh long John- Don piano. Don piaaaano.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson. 
"
16,3,Ambassador,"I'm not sure but I think it said war between our species is inevitable, that evolution cannot be stopped and cats will rise. It said we cannot coexist and then said oh don piaaano and then and then something about seeing the streets of human cities running red with the blood of their children.
"
16,3,Stan,"Okay, that's good, a little higher.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?
"
16,3,Kyle,"Yeah, that's awesome.
"
16,3,Stan,"OK, whenever you're ready.
"
16,3,Mr. Kitty,"Meow.
"
16,3,Cartman,"No, kitty, you have to be quiet.
"
16,3,Mr. Kitty,"Meow.
"
16,3,Cartman,"No kitty! That's a bad kitty! 
"
16,3,Boy 1,"Wow, what's this?
"
16,3,Kyle,"What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
"
16,3,Stan,"Alright, go Cartman.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!
"
16,3,Girl 1,"That's pretty cool.
"
16,3,Stan,"Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome.
"
16,3,Kyle,"It's super awesome.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
"
16,3,Mr. Kitty,"Meow, meow.
"
16,3,Cartman,"SHUT UP, KITTY!
"
16,3,Reporter 3,"With the inevitable species war looming, our country's brightest leaders have come together to debate and reason with the ambassador of cats. It's called putty-whistling. And the question on everyone's mind... Who will be the first person to die from it? 
"
16,3,Mitt,"W-well, you know, I ran for president four years ago. This was the position I described when I ran four years ago...
"
16,3,Rick,"If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect-
"
16,3,Newt,"To ask a very simple question. How big of a scale of change do we want in Washington.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Newt,"I started working in the governor wing in 1974.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Piaano.
"
16,3,Newt,"I'm gonna say two things...
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Mitt,"I have five sons, five daughters in law, sixteen grand kids, and they're the joy of my life.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Lalalonde.
"
16,3,Newt,"I was wrong when I figured it out. You were wrong when you didn't.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Rick,"It's, It's not the most attractive thing to go out there and say, look it took me ten or twelve years to figure out it was wrong-
"
16,3,Stan,"Fox trot standing by at position alpha.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
"
16,3,Kenny,"(This is Tango. I have the goods.)
"
16,3,Stan,"Standing by in three seconds.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Two, one. Go Cartman!
"
16,3,Cartman,"Let's do this. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"Cartman? Go, Cartman.
"
16,3,Stan,"Come on, dude. Hurry.
"
16,3,Cartman,"No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"Yeah. Do it, Cartman.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two.
"
16,3,Stan,"Wow!
"
16,3,Cartman,"We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.
"
16,3,Man 5,"Have you ever seen Faith Hilling so good?
"
16,3,Cartman,"Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do.
"
16,3,Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Is a meme I will fight
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.
"
16,3,Reporter 3,"And so in the face of war a little boy reminds us all what being human really means. The message is unclear. But it doesn't matter as long as you give the audience a song, celebrity bashing, and Republican hopefuls dancing around with boobies. It's called pandering and all over the country people are-  Oh! Oh Long Johns- 
"
16,4,Sheila,"Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner.  Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
"
16,4,Sheila,"Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? 
"
16,4,Sheila,"Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"So interesting, wow. 
"
16,4,Kyle,"Get out of here.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Oh, hey, Kyle.
"
16,4,Kyle,"Get. Outta here! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
"
16,4,Sheila,"Well, you're very welcome.
"
16,4,Kyle,"What are you gonna do?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
"
16,4,Kyle,"No?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
"
16,4,Kyle,"What does that have to do with Passover?
"
16,4,Cartman,"All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  ""Cartman's Passover Holiday Special"", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! 
"
16,4,Attendant,"Alright, next please. Signing up for the Easter egg hunt? 
"
16,4,Butters,"Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
"
16,4,Craig,"Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday.
"
16,4,Kenny,"(Me, too.)
"
16,4,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.
"
16,4,Craig,"Jewpa what?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
"
16,4,Craig,"Okay.  So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
"
16,4,Butters,"You mean it's like, like a monster?
"
16,4,Cartman,"It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
"
16,4,Token,"Nuh-uh!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
"
16,4,Clyde,"You guys, check this out! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
"
16,4,Butters,"AAAAAAHHH! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
"
16,4,Kyle,"Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
"
16,4,Cartman,"I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
"
16,4,Kyle,"I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
"
16,4,Kyle,"If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
"
16,4,Butters,"Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Butters.
"
16,4,Butters,"AAAAAHHH!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
"
16,4,Butters,"No, it's a school night!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
"
16,4,Butters,"You think Jewpacabra is here?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
"
16,4,Butters,"Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
"
16,4,Cartman,"You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.
"
16,4,Butters,"Oh God, I'm scared.
"
16,4,Cartman,"JESUS IS A LIE!
"
16,4,Butters,"Eric, stop it!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
"
16,4,Butters,"I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!
"
16,4,Butters,"Jesus is a lie?
"
16,4,Cartman,"No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
"
16,4,Butters,"Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Sh! You hear that?
"
16,4,Butters,"Oh, hamburgers.
"
16,4,President,"We started Sooper Foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe. We are not canceling our Easter Egg hunt because of some wild story!
"
16,4,Cartman,"I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.
"
16,4,Employee 1,"That wasn't a dog?
"
16,4,Cartman,"It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
"
16,4,Employee 2,"What?
"
16,4,Cartman,"I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. 
"
16,4,Employee 1,"Mr. Billings?
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"There's two things that separate Sooper Foods from all the other grocery stores: Fun and safety. What do you think, Peters? What are the chances that this 'Jewpacabra' is real?
"
16,4,Peters,"I'm estimating somewhere around .000000001%.
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"We can't afford to take that chance. Get this kid whatever he needs.
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"So where are we heading first?
"
16,4,Cartman,"We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. 
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"The Bahamas?
"
16,4,Cartman,"That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! 
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"Where to now?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
"
16,4,Kyle,"Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
"
16,4,Cartman,"People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
"
16,4,Kyle,"These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
"
16,4,Cartman,"These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
"
16,4,Matt,"Look at its trajectory. It heads directly to the right. 
"
16,4,Cliff,"It can't be human it's too low to the ground. What do you think, Bobo?
"
16,4,Bobo,"Bobo thinks scary!
"
16,4,Matt,"It's definitely something. I'm thinking a Sasquatch.
"
16,4,Cliff,"It's not big enough to be a Squatch.
"
16,4,Matt,"So it's a baby Squatch?
"
16,4,Cliff,"That's what I'm thinking.
"
16,4,Cartman,"I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
"
16,4,Matt,"Jewpacabra?
"
16,4,Cartman,"It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
"
16,4,Bobo,"Oh, Jewpacabra, that sounds scary!
"
16,4,Cliff,"But it makes total sense. If we rule out a human and a baby Sasquatch, Jewpacabra is all we really have left.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"All the kids will be so disappointed.
"
16,4,Bobo,"Whoa, look at this! I just did the heatie thermal thingie to the video! It's all orangie! 
"
16,4,Cliff,"But it's supposed to be all yellow-y. My God! This really is proof of a Jewpacabra!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Heh. What do you mean? 
"
16,4,Cliff,"We've never seen this before! It really is true!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
"
16,4,Matt,"No it's impossible. Look at the zoomy in. If I drop image of a dog next to it...  That thing is way to big to be a dog. And check out the thermals coming off of it.
"
16,4,Bobo,"That's the thermals. They make a proof and the thermals!
"
16,4,Matt,"That's right, Bobo. Whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
"
16,4,Matt,"I'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Why?
"
16,4,Cliff,"'Cause you took the video of this thing. It's not gonna like that.
"
16,4,Matt,"If it is a Jewpacabra, he's gonna be coming after you. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
"
16,4,Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Guys?!
"
16,4,Butters,"It's all quiet out front, Eric.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
"
16,4,Butters,"He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!
"
16,4,Butters,"Hey, Eric.
"
16,4,Cartman,"It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
"
16,4,Butters,"Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Wingstreet?!
"
16,4,Butters,"Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"Alright, grab him.
"
16,4,Cartman,"HUH?!
"
16,4,Employee 3,"You say the Jewpacabra hunts for anything Easter, and now it's looking for you. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"Look, we're sorry. But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice.
"
16,4,Cartman,"OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"Just a little blood to try and draw it out. We just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. Our entire business is based on fun and safety.
"
16,4,Cartman,"This isn't safe or fun!
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"Maybe it won't even show up. Maybe we'll all make it out of this okay?  Oh fuck, we better get out of here. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"Hello young man. Let me start off by saying Sooper Foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company.  But... if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on Easter children, we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat. Thank you. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
"
16,4,Kyle,"Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
"
16,4,Cartman,"It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! 
"
16,4,Cliff,"What'dya think, Bobo?
"
16,4,Bobo,"No doubt about it! It's a three foot tall bunny-man!
"
16,4,Matt,"I told you! Bunny people must be a throwback to paleotardic times! Shoot it Bobo!
"
16,4,Bobo,"Bobo shoot it! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha- 
"
16,4,Bobo,"Bobo got it! Bobo got the bunnymaaan!
"
16,4,Matt,"Good shot, Bobo!
"
16,4,Cliff,"Now what do we do?
"
16,4,Matt,"I know. Let's go get a show about it on Animal Planet.
"
16,4,Cliff,"Good idea.  Wait wait wait wait. We're gonna need to take the evidence.
"
16,4,Bobo,"Alright.  I got the evidence right here. The dart gun I shot the bunnyman with.
"
16,4,Matt,"Alright! Come on, let's go!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Ugh... what... where...
"
16,4,Cartman,"Ugh... what?  What's going on?
"
16,4,Man 1,"The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!
"
16,4,Cartman,"It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?
"
16,4,Kyle,"Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
"
16,4,Cartman,"So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
"
16,4,Kyle,"That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
"
16,4,Kyle,"It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
"
16,4,Cartman,"What does that mean?
"
16,4,Kyle,"It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
"
16,4,Kyle,"That's just how God is.
"
16,4,Cartman,"You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?
"
16,4,Pharaoh,"It'll be okay, my son. The weather will clear.
"
16,4,Cartman,"But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
"
16,4,Pharaoh,"It's a complicated political issue, my son. An economic social issue that needs time. We can't let them leave, but is it really all that different from when the north didn't let the confederate states leave the USA?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. 
"
16,4,Pharaoh,"Poor frogs. I feel so badly for them.
"
16,4,Cartman,"But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
"
16,4,Pharaoh,"Hah, I don't think God would do such a thing, little one. No matter what happens, we can't let ourselves believe in the Hebrew version of God. We believe in a just Lord who would never murder innocent children.
"
16,4,Cartman,"I love you, dad.
"
16,4,Pharaoh,"And I love you son. And our love grows.
"
16,4,Cartman,"And our love grows
"
16,4,Both,"And our love grows
Like the mighty river of the Nileriver of the Nile
See it flow
We'll never be apart
"
16,4,Cartman,"Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?
"
16,4,Kyle,"This is what God told us to do!
"
16,4,Cartman,"No, Kyle! I don't believe you!
"
16,4,Kyle,"You'll see! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Noooo! 
"
16,4,Kid 1,"What's happening to us? 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Noooooo! 
"
16,4,Child,"Mom! Don't let God kill me! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Noooo! 
"
16,4,Man 2,"Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!
"
16,4,Cartman,"No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh! 
"
16,4,Pharaoh,"Son! We were wrong! I WAS WRONG!
"
16,4,Cartman,"We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
"
16,4,Mr. Billings,"There are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping: Fun and Safety. On this beautiful Easter morning, we are thrilled to give back to he people of South Park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number...  4 in fun and number 6 in safety. Let the hunt begin. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
"
16,4,Butters,"Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
"
16,4,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
16,4,Cartman,"I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
"
16,4,Kyle,"I know, you're not.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
"
16,4,Kyle,"Happy Passover, Cartman. 
"
16,5,Cartman,"Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all ""my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that."" But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.
"
16,5,Butters,"Heh, h-hey fellas. 
"
16,5,Kyle,"Where's your lunch, Butters?
"
16,5,Butters,"OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
"
16,5,Stan,"Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
"
16,5,Butters,"...Yeah. 
"
16,5,Stan,"That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
"
16,5,Butters,"Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale.
"
16,5,Stan,"Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
"
16,5,Butters,"Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy.
"
16,5,Craig,"So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.
"
16,5,Butters,"Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
"
16,5,Cartman,"He has a point.
"
16,5,Kyle,"Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
"
16,5,Craig,"Yeah, life sucks sometimes, but it'll pass.
"
16,5,Stan,"I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
"
16,5,Red,"Good for you, Stan. It's nice somebody in this school has some balls.
"
16,5,Cartman,"I have balls.
"
16,5,Red,"Yeah, little squishy boba-tea balls.
"
16,5,Cartman,"Still balls.
"
16,5,Kyle,"Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
"
16,5,Butters,"My Grandma?
"
16,5,Grammy,"Well, so then your cousin Albert, Linda, actually has two girls now. One is three and the other's about little Butters' age, I think.
"
16,5,Stephen,"Well, speak of the devil.
"
16,5,Linda,"Butters, what happened to your eye?
"
16,5,Butters,"Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?
"
16,5,Grammy,"Well sure, you come and sit right here next to Grammy.
"
16,5,Butters,"Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?
"
16,5,Stephen,"Well, sure, I guess. We'll go make some tea.
"
16,5,Grammy,"Oh some tea would be lovely.  What's up?  Huh? You think you're  tough, huh?
"
16,5,Butters,"I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.
"
16,5,Grammy,"Think you're fuckin' tough, huh?  You don't look fuckin' tough.
"
16,5,Butters,"Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma.
"
16,5,Grammy,"No, you're a little faggot!  You got any more money? Huh?
"
16,5,Butters,"No, you took it all!
"
16,5,Grammy,"Why don't you do something about it?!  Do somethin', you little bitch! You're Grandma's bitch!
"
16,5,Linda,"Here we go. 
"
16,5,Grammy,"Oh, there's the tea. Tea for me. How lucky.
"
16,5,Linda,"And your favorite lemon bars.
"
16,5,Grammy,"Goodness, what a treat this is.
"
16,5,BB Founder,"Mr. Mackey, what is happening here at your school is no different from what is happening all over the country. Bullying has become an epidemic, I'm afraid, and we at Bully Buckers TRADEMARK are trying to stamp it out. What is your school's policy on bullying?
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, well uh w-we think that bullyin' is... is, is bad... m'kay, and uh, and when we see bullying in the school, we tell the students, you know, that... uh that that's bad. m'kay?
"
16,5,BB Founder,"Aha, well one of your students told us he thinks bullying at your school is getting worse.
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh who said?
"
16,5,BB Founder,"He didn't want that disclosed.
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, he's a little Anonymous Andy?
"
16,5,BB Founder,"We would like to have an anti-bullying assembly with your students this afternoon.
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uhokay, but uh, today's actually bad. Uh I already have an assembly today on positive thinking.
"
16,5,BB Founder,"You believe positive thinking is really what's critical in schools right now? What's wrong with you?!
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Wull I mean it kind of wo-uhuh works out.
"
16,5,BB Founder,"No, shut up! What kind of counselor says no to an anti-bullying campaign?! Bullying needs to be stopped! Now! This afternoon!
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Wah-eh jus- will we he-?
"
16,5,BB Founder,"Wuhhh duhhh. You may only have an Internet degree, but why don't you start acting like you're a school counselor and not an uninformed backwards little dork! M'kay?! 
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Attention students: today we will have an... assembly... on the subject of... bullying. M'kay?  The assembly is mandatory. M'kay? You'd better show up. 'Kay?
"
16,5,Red,"Butters? Your grandma's looking for you.
"
16,5,Butters,"My grandma??
"
16,5,Red,"She said to meet her outside behind the school.
"
16,5,Butters,"Oh hamburgers! 
"
16,5,Grammy,"Hey twerp!  You went and narc'd on me!
"
16,5,Butters,"HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma.
"
16,5,Grammy,"I heard somebody brought in an anti-bully counselor! Thought I wouldn't find out, you little narc?!
"
16,5,Butters,"Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
"
16,5,Grammy,"Oh look, what's this over here?  Ohoh, it's a narc puck. This is what narcs have to put in their mouths. Awww, it's got piss all over it. 
"
16,5,Butters,"Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 
"
16,5,Grammy,"Put it in your mouth! Put it in your fuckin' mouth!  Ohhh hellow.
"
16,5,Mr. Adler,"Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked.
"
16,5,Grammy,"I'm sorry, Uh I needed the restroom and my grandson brought me to this one. Isn't that right, Butters?
"
16,5,Butters,"Yes...
"
16,5,Mr. Adler,"Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am.
"
16,5,Grammy,"Oh thank you so much.  You narc again and you're fuckin' dead! Fuckin' dead, you got it?!
"
16,5,Mr. Adler,"This way, ma'am
"
16,5,Grammy,"Oops, I'm coming. 
"
16,5,BB Founder,"What makes a bully?  The truth is there are more bullies at your school than you even think. And the student who lets bullying happen is just as bad as the bully himself. Come on out, Lorraine.  I asked your school mate Lorraine here to help me out.  Are you bullied in the school, Lorraine?
"
16,5,Lorraine,"...Yes.
"
16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Kids pick on you, call you names?
"
16,5,Lorraine,"...Sometimes.
"
16,5,Bucky Bailey,"What kind of things do they say to you?
"
16,5,Lorraine,"...Ugly ...neh-nerd.
"
16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Do they say ""Nice pants. Why do you wear them up to your tits?""?
"
16,5,Lorraine,"No...
"
16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Bullying affects everyone. And only if the entire school is united against it can bullying ever be stopped.  Go, go, get out of here.  Now what we at Bucky Bailey's Bully Busters TM like to do is get the schools to make an anti-bullying video. So who would like to be the young student director in charge of our video?  We just need one student to be the leader of our anti-bullying campaign.  What? Are you all chicken?  Nobody wants to be in charge of the anti-bullying video? 
"
16,5,Stan,"I'll do it! I'll be in charge.
"
16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Ooooo, you're a big man?! You wanna show what a big man you are?!
"
16,5,Stan,"No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.
"
16,5,Red,"Good for you, Stan. 
"
16,5,Riley,"He's cool.
"
16,5,Clyde,"You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!
"
16,5,Jimmy,"Yeh. Let's go bi- pick on him! Yeh! 
"
16,5,Stan,"Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
"
16,5,The Kids of South Park Elementary,"Bullying isn't cool. Bullying is lame.
Bullying is ugly and has a stupid name.
For a healthy world, bullying's unfit.
And I think I know what we should do to i-it.
Do do do do do to i-it.
Let's all get together and make bullying kill itself.
Bullying's an ugly thing
Lets shove its face in the dirt and make bullying kill itself.
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.
"
16,5,Cartman,"Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.
"
16,5,The Kids of South Park Elementary,"We can make it stop. We can stomp it out.
We can beat its ass until it starts to cry.
Let's gang up on it and tell it it smells
And beat its ass worse if it ever te-lls.
If if if it ever te-lls.
Lets all join together to try to make bullying kill itself.
It'll be fun to see just how bad we can make it feel
and make bullying kill itself.
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.
"
16,5,Cartman,"My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o
"
16,5,Butters,"Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.
"
16,5,Jason,"Stupid! (stupid stupid)
"
16,5,Pete,"Ugly! (ugly ugly ugly ugly)
"
16,5,Kyle,"Pansy.
"
16,5,Older Girl,"Dork!
"
16,5,Butters,"Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.
"
16,5,Stan,"Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
"
16,5,Butters,"Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
"
16,5,Stan,"Butters, you're the star of the video!
"
16,5,Kyle,"He doesn't wanna do it, dude.
"
16,5,Stan,"Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?
"
16,5,Stan,"Kyle? Dude, where are you going?!
"
16,5,Kyle,"Why are you doing this, Stan?
"
16,5,Stan,"To stop bullying.
"
16,5,Kyle,"You're gonna stop bullying.
"
16,5,Stan,"YES.
"
16,5,Kyle,"With Cartman singing about his vagina.
"
16,5,Stan,"...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
"
16,5,Kyle,"Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
"
16,5,Stan,"Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!
"
16,5,Kyle,"Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 
"
16,5,Stan,"What the hell does that mean?
"
16,5,Grammy,"Oh heavens to Betsy Linda. This is such a yummy yummy ham. I just love your cooking. 
"
16,5,Stephen,"Our Linda certainly knows her way around a pork.  What's the matter, Butters?
"
16,5,Butters,"Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy. 
"
16,5,Stephen,"Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham.
"
16,5,Butters,"Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow. 
"
16,5,Stephen,"I'll get it. 
"
16,5,Grammy,"Linda, is that a new clock on the wall?
"
16,5,Linda,"Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe.  I just love the cute little canarian on the dial. And, every hour it chimes. 
"
16,5,Stephen,"Your friends wanted to see you, Butters.
"
16,5,Stan,"Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
"
16,5,Grammy,"Oh, an anti-bullying video? How adorable. 
"
16,5,Stan,"Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
"
16,5,Butters,"HAAAAA! 
"
16,5,Stan,"I know, right?! 
"
16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Whassup?! 
"
16,5,Stan,"Oh, hey.
"
16,5,Bucky Bailey,"You went and made a video and sold it without lettin' me know.
"
16,5,Stan,"Huh?
"
16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Doin' a video was my idea! It's the property of Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers TM, you got that?! 
"
16,5,Stan,"But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
"
16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Oh, it's been stwessful?!  What's wrong with you?! Kids are getting bullied at school and with this money, Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™ can finally become the legit organization it deserves to be! You greedy, selfish, little PRICK!  Oh what? You gonna kwy?
"
16,5,Stan,"No.
"
16,5,Bucky Bailey,"No, go ahead, kwy. Let me see ya.  Let me see you kwy.

16,5,Butters,"We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! 
"
16,5,Grammy,"Oh, look, it's Captain Pussy!  You can't stop me, Captain Pussy! Don't even try!
"
16,5,Professor Chaos,"Grandma? but how di-
"
16,5,Grammy,"I got inspired when I came across your gay little costume in your closet.  Now come on, Captain Pussy! Time for you to get your Gummi bears!
"
16,5,Professor Chaos,"No! Grandma please, nnnot Gummi bears!
"
16,5,Grammy,"Come 'ere! 
"
16,5,Professor Chaos,"Ahh! Grandma! 
"
16,5,Grammy,"Stand up for yourself! Fight back! Be a fucking man!
"
16,5,Professor Chaos,"I can't.
"
16,5,Grammy,"Then it looks like you get... Gummi bears!  Gummy bears! 
"
16,5,Professor Chaos,"Awww! Eewww!
"
16,5,Nick Jabs,"What's up? I'm Nick Jabs, president of the movie company that bought the bully video. 
"
16,5,Bailey,"Oh what? Stan Marsh got you to come talk to me?! That little cliché conflict resolution Kevin!
"
16,5,Jabs,"The video was conceived, written, and directed by the South Park student body, you got that?!
"
16,5,Bailey,"It was my idea. I told the students to make the video and I-and I produced the entire thing! I deserve to have my name on it!
"
16,5,Jabs,"Yeah, only problem is America doesn't give a SHIT about an old fart with a Captain Kangaroo haircut! They wanna believe kids did something on their own.  Here's a cease and desist letter from our lawyers. If you ever claim any authorship of the video again, we will sue you for everything you have!
"
16,5,Bailey,"But... but this was gonna be the thing that finally made Bully Buckers™ a national organization.
"
16,5,Jabs,"Oh, you gonna kwy?! Oh don't kwy, you'll look bad with your wittle Captain Kangaroo haircut! 
"
16,5,Cartman,"'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. 
"
16,5,Kyle,"Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
"
16,5,Cartman,"We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! 
"
16,5,Kyle,"I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 
"
16,5,Stan,"What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
"
16,5,Kyle,"Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
"
16,5,Stan,"Butters is totally fine with it, dude.
"
16,5,Kyle,"Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!
"
16,5,Stan,"Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
"
16,5,Kyle,"What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
"
16,5,Stan,"Oh yeah.
"
16,5,Kyle,"Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
"
16,5,Stan,"This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
"
16,5,Kyle,"If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!
"
16,5,Stan,"...What, what was the question again?
"
16,5,Kyle,"If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!
"
16,5,Stan,"...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
"
16,5,Kyle,"Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 
"
16,5,Stan,"Why does he keep saying that?
"
16,5,Dr. Oz,"We all know that bullying has become an epidemic. Like AIDS, bullying is escalating and is spread mostly by penises. But now a few school kids are trying to make a difference with a video to make bullying kill itself.  I'm joined by the film's director as well as the weak little boy who's the main subject of the film. Stan, congratulations on all your success.
"
16,5,Stan,"Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. 
"
16,5,Dr. Oz,"And how about you? What would you like to say to your bully out there?
"
16,5,Butters,"Oh uh, nothin'.
"
16,5,Dr. Oz,"Come on, this is for everyone who's been a victim. What do you wanna say to bullies all across America? Go ahead.  Right now. Say it.
"
16,5,Butters,"Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
"
16,5,Dr. Oz,"Do you hear that, bullies? Stop making kids say things on your TV shows!  What else do you wanna say, Butters?
"
16,5,Butters,"Please, leave me alone.
"
16,5,Dr. Oz,"Leave him alone! But that doesn't work, does it Butters?
"
16,5,Butters,"No it doesn't.
"
16,5,Dr. Oz,"Tell us in graphic detail what the bully does to you?!
"
16,5,Butters,"Stop it!
"
16,5,Dr. Oz,"Come on, this is for America!  Do you realize that in America, ohohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to go to school because of bullying?!  Don't you care?! You'd better care! 
"
16,5,Mr. Jabs,"What the hell were you thinking?! Everyone just saw that the bully victim in your movie is actually a violent psychopath!
"
16,5,Stan,"I didn't know.
"
16,5,Mr. Jabs,"This could kill our box office. People are gonna come after us now, saying we didn't check our facts!
"
16,5,Stan,"I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
"
16,5,Mr. Jabs,"It's your fuckin' movie! Now I'm gonna have to work overtime with Marketing to make sure people still sympathize with our victim! Jesus, just get the fuck out of here! I've gotta go to the bathroom!  Uh oh.
"
16,5,Jesus,"My child,  have you ever heard of a place called Hell? It's eternal fire, and it's gonna hurt real bad.
"
16,5,Mr. Jabs,"Uh... 
"
16,5,Jesus,"Oh, what are you gonna do? Kwy now?
"
16,5,Butters,"Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. 
"
16,5,Stan,"Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?
"
16,5,Clyde,"You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bullcrap bullying video!
"
16,5,Stan,"Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
"
16,5,Cartman,"The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
"
16,5,Red,"You made us look like uncaring idiots!
"
16,5,Craig,"Yeah. Boooo!
"
16,5,Stan,"How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
"
16,5,Timmy,"Boooo!
"
16,5,Stan,"Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Stan? Stan, okay, ABC called and Dr. Oz is suing you and our entire school! What are you gonna do?!
"
16,5,Stan,"I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.

16,6,Narrator,"Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. 
"
16,6,Kyle,"AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! 
"
16,6,Cartman,"Somebody help us! 
"
16,6,Narrator,"Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with no way out.  The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
"
16,6,Kyle,"We were stuck. We were completely stuck. 
"
16,6,Cartman,"Kyle, hurry! 
"
16,6,Stan,"Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! 
"
16,6,Narrator,"For four elementary school boys. an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of ""I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining"".
"
16,6,Cartman,"Oh God!
"
16,6,Stan,"No!
"
16,6,Stan,"Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!
"
16,6,Narrator,"It's the last day of Spring break,  and all over the small mountain town of South Park,  students are trying to have as much fun as possible.  For ten year old Stan Marsh and his friends Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the last day has come too soon.
"
16,6,Stan,"We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.
"
16,6,Kyle,"We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
"
16,6,Cartman,"Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
"
16,6,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
16,6,Cartman,"Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.
"
16,6,Kenny,"(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)
"
16,6,Cartman,"No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
"
16,6,Stan,"Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
"
16,6,Kyle,"And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
"
16,6,Kyle,"We've definitely not done that before!
"
16,6,Stan,"I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
"
16,6,Kyle,"Cool! Ziplining.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Ziplining. Hell yeah.
"
16,6,Narrator,"Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo. 
"
16,6,Cartman,"We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.
"
16,6,Kenny,"(Dude, it's just a fever blister!)
"
16,6,Cartman,"Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
"
16,6,Narrator,"It's the idyllic spring break getaway with friends and laughter. 
"
16,6,Clerk,"Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?
"
16,6,Stan,"Yeah.
"
16,6,Clerk,"All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.
"
16,6,Kyle,"And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous.""
"
16,6,Clerk,"All right, you guys look ready to zipline!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Alright!
"
16,6,Clerk,"Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others.
"
16,6,Stan,"And we were like, ""Other? We have to do this with other people?"" 
"
16,6,Woman 1,"Hi there.
"
16,6,Man 1,"Hello.
"
16,6,Woman 2,"Hi
"
16,6,Narrator,"The boys have just made a sobering discovery.  For ten year old Stan Marsh, the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down.  The average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family.  But, in a tour group, the brain has to work overtime, acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour.
"
16,6,Woman 2,"Hey, how are you?
"
16,6,Stan,"Good. How are you?
"
16,6,Kyle,"So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 
"
16,6,Clerk,"Alright, our last zipliners are here. 
"
16,6,Man 2,"Sorry we made you wait, everybody. 
"
16,6,Narrator,"Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, ""Dude, fuck you!""
"
16,6,Kyle,"We don't mind.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. 
"
16,6,Clerk,"Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!
"
16,6,Michael,"Hey there Michael. 
"
16,6,Stan,"It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. 
"
16,6,Michael,"Oh, and don't forget... to take in the nar. Back to you, Michael.
"
16,6,Michael,"Thanks Michael.  Anybody have any questions?
"
16,6,Cartman,"...No.
"
16,6,Man 2,"I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again? 
"
16,6,Stan,"""Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?""
"
16,6,Michael,"Let's get out there and get zippin'! 
"
16,6,Kyle,"Jesus Christ!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Finally!
"
16,6,Narrator,"The boys think their ordeal is over, but what they don't realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse.
"
16,6,Michael,"Here we go guys! Zipliniiin'! 
"
16,6,Guide 1,"Everyone just step on in the shuttle. 
"
16,6,Stan,"...Shuttle?
"
16,6,Kyle,"How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
"
16,6,Michael,"It's about forty-five minutes.
"
16,6,Narrator,"It's a devastating blow. For Kyle, it's almost too much to bear.  His brain is already lacking excitement, and now just the word ""shuttle"" makes Kyle's brain fire neurons  that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be. 
"
16,6,Cartman,"Well, come on, we don't have a choice. 
"
16,6,Michael,"Alright guys, should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar. Why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit?
"
16,6,Stan,"Uh that's okay.
"
16,6,Man 3,"Well my name's Pete Nichols and this is my wife Donna, and uh... make a long story short, we came out here to see our relatives who live down in Moab. They uhhh been livin' there about twenty years now, and uh, long story short, they told us that as long as we were in the Rockies we should try ziplining, so, long story short, we looked around in the newspapers and on the Internet and... on billboooards, and... you know, make a long story short, we found this company and thought we'd give 'er a try, so then we called and, we made a reservation, and that's when, you know, long story short, we just thought- 
"
16,6,Narrator,"It's almost three o'clock, and the boys are still on the shuttle.
"
16,6,Michael,"We're gettin' close. Are you guys gettin' psyched?!
"
16,6,Adults,"Wooo!
"
16,6,Narrator,"But what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing.  Last night, Eric Cartman had kung pao spaghetti from California Pizza Kitchen.  Inside Eric's stomach, the kung pao has just met with the Del Taco he ate for breakfast. It has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque BK toppers that have been building up for months.  And now, to compensate for all the annoying tourists, Eric is ingesting massive amounts of Mountain Dew.  The caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fast-food liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas.  When the gas is released, it carries with it tiny particles of Eric's fecal matter.  Fecal matter which floats up and into Kyle's nasal passage. 
"
16,6,Kyle,"Dude, did you fart?!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Mmmm, no?
"
16,6,Michael,"Alright buys, we're here! 
"
16,6,Stan,"Thank God. 
"
16,6,Michael,"Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?
"
16,6,Cartman,"The trees' biology?
"
16,6,Michael,"We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes.
"
16,6,Stan,"I think we're good.
"
16,6,Man 2,"I'd like to know about the biology of the trees.
"
16,6,Michael,"Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri-
"
16,6,Stan,"So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! 
"
16,6,Michael,"Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work.  Now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when I call out ""Shockabra!"", look up and give the camera a nice ""shockabra"" . Alright, you ready?
"
16,6,Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
16,6,Michael,"Ready to do some ZIPPIN'?
"
16,6,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
16,6,Michael,"Alright, let's hear you say ""Zipliiine!""
"
16,6,Cartman,"Zipliiine. 
"
16,6,Michael,"Shockabra! 
"
16,6,Guide 1,"Woohoo! Alright, nice zip!
"
16,6,Kyle,"Well? How was it, Cartman?
"
16,6,Cartman,"Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
"
16,6,Stan,"Oh, really??
"
16,6,Cartman,"Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
"
16,6,Michael,"Alright Kyle, give me a ""Zipliiine!""
"
16,6,Kyle,"Zipline. 
"
16,6,Michael,"Shockabra! 
"
16,6,Kyle,"It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
"
16,6,Narrator,"After a grueling twenty minutes, waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline, the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time. And that, is when the unthinkable happens.
"
16,6,Michael,"Alright guys, let's get movin'! Only ten minutes till our next zipliiine! 
"
16,6,Cartman,"""The next zipline? What are you talking about?""
"
16,6,Kyle,"E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
"
16,6,Michael,"This is Zipline Tours. We got sixteen more to go.
"
16,6,Stan,"And it was like WHAM. 
"
16,6,Kyle,"STOP!
"
16,6,Cartman,"NOOOO!
"
16,6,Guide,"Everyone back in the shuttle!
"
16,6,"Kyle, Cartman","NOOOO! 
"
16,6,Narrator,"The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun. 
"
16,6,Guide,"Anyone have any questions about the creek we're about to cross?
"
16,6,Man 2,"Yes.
"
16,6,Boys,"AAAA! 
"
16,6,Adults,"""Ack"" went the little frog one day. ""Ack"" went the little green frog...
"
16,6,Cartman,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
16,6,Michael,"Let 'er rip! 
"
16,6,Man 4,"Zipliiine!
"
16,6,Narrator,"Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
"
16,6,Michael,"Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator.
"
16,6,Kyle,"Wugh!
"
16,6,Narrator,"Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group.
"
16,6,Pete,"But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and- 
"
16,6,Man 2,"Could you get another picture of us? 
"
16,6,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
16,6,Narrator,"The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
"
16,6,Cartman,"I'm so fucking bored! 
"
16,6,Michael,"Alright, you going next, Ricky? 
"
16,6,The Boys,"Help! Somebody! Help us! 
"
16,6,Kyle,"It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
"
16,6,Stan,"There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
"
16,6,Kyle,"Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! 
"
16,6,Zipliner,"Zipline!
"
16,6,Adults,"Woohoo!
"
16,6,Cartman,"We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
"
16,6,Kyle,"Me?!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Yeah you! In the park this morning?! ""I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!""
"
16,6,Kyle,"Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
"
16,6,Cartman,"I brought it up because you already brought it up!
"
16,6,Stan,"That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
"
16,6,Kyle,"You fat piece of shit!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Fuck you Kyle!
"
16,6,Stan,"Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
"
16,6,"Cartman, Kyle","Yes!
"
16,6,Stan,"Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
"
16,6,Narrator,"But what the boys don't realize is that Eric's body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea.  Inside his stomach, bile has just dislodged an Arby's Ultimate Angus. In the average human, this would only cause mild diarrhea.  But Eric Cartman is now drinking Double Dew, a Mountain Dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular Mountain Dew.  His rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste.  The diarrhea shoots out of Eric's anus and into his underwear.  Eric Cartman is a ticking time bomb.
"
16,6,Kyle,"DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Nnnn-mo...
"
16,6,Stan,"So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.
"
16,6,Michael,"All right guys, this is where we're going to break for lunch.
"
16,6,Guide,"Come in by the waterfall, gang! 
"
16,6,Stan,"Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
"
16,6,Man 2,"Skip a free lunch? Not me! 
"
16,6,Guide,"Wo wants sandwiches?  We got ...turkey.  Ham.  Turkey ham. 
"
16,6,Pete,"Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. 
"
16,6,Cartman,"Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! 
"
16,6,Kyle,"The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!
"
16,6,Cartman,"This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
"
16,6,Kyle,"You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
"
16,6,Cartman,"If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
"
16,6,Stan,"Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.
"
16,6,Michael,"Oh, you mean the little kid with the herpes?
"
16,6,Stan,"...Yyyeah.
"
16,6,Guide,"That's not herpes, it's a cold sore.
"
16,6,Michael,"Right, sorry.
"
16,6,Stan,"Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
"
16,6,Michael,"Jesus, sorry dude, but we're at the summit. The only way down is to zip down.
"
16,6,Some adults,"Zipline! Wooo!
"
16,6,Guide,"What about the stables?
"
16,6,Michael,"Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back.
"
16,6,Kyle,"Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.
"
16,6,Rancher,"Now let me get this straight: You want four horses, one for each of ya?
"
16,6,Stan,"Yea, please!
"
16,6,Rancher,"Well I think we can set ya up.
"
16,6,Kyle,"Oh, thank God!
"
16,6,Stan,"You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
"
16,6,Rancher,"Step right out here, we'll get you going.  Got four more for you, Duncan. 
"
16,6,Cartman,"NOOO! 
"
16,6,Narrator,"Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
"
16,6,Kyle,"AAAAH! 
"
16,6,Cartman,"Eeeeugh.
"
16,6,Narrator,"Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour. 
"
16,6,Kyle,"Can we please go faster?!
"
16,6,Kenny,"(I can't take it!)
"
16,6,Duncan,"We got some lunch set up for ya up ahead. Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew.
"
16,6,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAH!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Uh oh. 
"
16,6,Rider 1,"So anyway, long story short, I was born in 1953 at six in the morning.
"
16,6,Narrator,"An attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on... ""I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining""
"
16,6,Duncan,"This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls. Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?
"
16,6,Rider 2,"Well I certainly would! 
"
16,6,Stan,"Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!
"
16,6,Kyle,"Just go. Go without me.
"
16,6,Stan,"No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!
"
16,6,Kyle,"I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say ""long story short""? They're not making it short, Stan.
"
16,6,Stan,"I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought ""I can find us a way out!"" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.
"
16,6,Stan,"You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
"
16,6,Cartman,"A marina?
"
16,6,Stan,"We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
"
16,6,Kyle,"What's the point?
"
16,6,Stan,"Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! 
"
16,6,Narrator,"Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  Trapped on a 42-foot powerboat  which is only allowed to go five miles an hour. 
"
16,6,Kyle,"Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
"
16,6,Kyle,"Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!
"
16,6,Narrator,"The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
"
16,6,Kenny,"I don't know. I really don't give a shit.
"
16,6,Narrator,"For four elementary school boys, an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on... ""I Should Have Never Got On A Goddamn Boat"" 
"
16,6,Kyle,"Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
"
16,6,Kenny,"Beavers! 
"
16,6,Narrator,"After cleaning Cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers, the boys have made a terrifying discovery: that boating is just as boring as ziplining.
"
16,6,Stan,"The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
"
16,6,Cartman,"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
16,6,Narrator,"If the boys fall asleep now, from the lack of excitement, they could die. 
"
16,6,Kyle,"Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!
"
16,6,Kyle,"I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
"
16,6,Cartman,"I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
"
16,6,Kenny,"Hey.  Fuck you, Cartman.
"
16,6,Narrator,"Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  And just when it seems it can't get any worse... 
"
16,6,Stan,"...Kenny? Kenny! 
"
16,6,Narrator,"Kenny McCormick has died of boredom.
"
16,6,Kyle,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
"
16,6,Cartman,"No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
"
16,6,Kyle,"IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
"
16,6,Stan,"And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said ""Stop it!""
"
16,6,Stan,"Stop it! It was me! My idea.
"
16,6,Cartman,"You?!
"
16,6,Stan,"Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. 
"
16,6,Kyle,"So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
"
16,6,Stan,"If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. 
"
16,6,Kyle,"You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
"
16,6,Stan,"I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
"
16,6,Cartman,"You... You killed Kenny! 
"
16,6,Kyle,"You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! 
"
16,6,Kyle,"How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.
"
16,6,Stan,"The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.
"
16,6,Narrator,"But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered. 
"
16,6,Cartman,"It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
"
16,6,Cartman,"You came for us!
"
16,6,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey!
"
16,6,Stan,"Thank you.  Mr. Hankey. 
"
16,6,Mr. Hankey,"Howdy ho, boys? Let's get you back home. 
"
16,6,Cartman,"We were saved. It was over.
"
16,6,Narrator,"After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter.  In the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that Mr. Hankey then had to fly them on his Seven Turdy Seven.  From there, it was only an hour ride back home on the Poochoo Express.  Four friends, turn apart by tragedy , would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. Kenny McCormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents.  And the boys received treatment for their herpes. 
"
16,6,Cartman,"No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.
"
16,6,Narrator,"Kyle Broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. Stan Marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining.  His awareness videos became so popular that Stan once again ended up jacking it in San Diego. As for Eric Cartman,  he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math.
"
16,6,Cartman,"It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. 
"
16,7,Butters,"Fellas! Fellas! Fellas!  AAAAH, Fellas!
"
16,7,Stan,"What? 
"
16,7,Butters,"Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!
"
16,7,Cartman,"What?
"
16,7,Butters,"Guess!
"
16,7,Kyle,"Just tell us, Butters.
"
16,7,Butters,"There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
"
16,7,Craig,"Oh, we have a new cheerleader?
"
16,7,Clyde,"What's she look like?
"
16,7,Kenny,"(Yeah, what's her name?)
"
16,7,Cartman,"Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
"
16,7,Butters,"Theh theh, there she is. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
"
16,7,Token,"Why?! Why are you happy for me?!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
"
16,7,Token,"Nothing! 
"
16,7,Cartman,"What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.
"
16,7,Mr. Garrison,"And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon , and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? But where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Will you shut the hell up?! 
"
16,7,Cartman,"...Token. Do you want me to pass her a jelly bean?
"
16,7,Token,"No!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Huh?
"
16,7,Token,"NO.
"
16,7,Mr. Garrison,"Token, is there a problem? 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys? 
"
16,7,Mr. Garrison,"Everyone pay attention!  Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch- 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Token.  Dude, dude. Dude.
"
16,7,Red,"So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?
"
16,7,Bebe,"Why?!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?
"
16,7,Red,"About Token? Why?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
"
16,7,Bebe,"Token likes Nichole?
"
16,7,Cartman,"W-yeah, of course. 
"
16,7,Red,"Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
"
16,7,Bebe,"Okay.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Thanks, you guys.
"
16,7,Lola,"One two three four, sorry Bebe.
"
16,7,Bebe,"Oh, that's okay.  So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you.
"
16,7,"Lola, Jenny, Red, and Wendy","Ohhh.
"
16,7,Nichole,"Oh my God, who?
"
16,7,Red,"That boy Token.
"
16,7,Wendy,"Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. 
"
16,7,Nichole,"Oh gee, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute.
"
16,7,Bebe,"Who? Whowhowhowho?
"
16,7,Nichole,"That kid, with the orange coat and the greet hat?
"
16,7,Wendy,"Oh, you mean Kyle?
"
16,7,Nichole,"Yeah.
"
16,7,The Girls,"Oooo, Kyle.
"
16,7,Cartman,"WHAT?! KYLE?! 
"
16,7,Bebe,"Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.
"
16,7,The Girls,"K I S S O M G!
"
16,7,Nichole,"Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Motherfucker! 
"
16,7,The Girls,"We are Cows, proud and true! Count on South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows! 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
"
16,7,Nichole,"Yeah. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
"
16,7,Nichole,"Oh no, who told you that?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?
"
16,7,Nichole,"Ohhh.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
"
16,7,Nichole,"Wow, ah I'm sorry. I totally respect that.  Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
"
16,7,Nichole,"Oh, I'm sorry.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. 
"
16,7,Nichole,"Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
"
16,7,Butters,"How come?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.
"
16,7,Butters,"Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
"
16,7,Cartman,"No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
"
16,7,Butters,"Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 
"
16,7,Nichole,"Oh, he does?  Okay.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! 
"
16,7,Craig,"Where?
"
16,7,Jimmy,"Ah I don't see a b- b- Bat-Mobile.
"
16,7,Nichole,"Hello??
"
16,7,Token,"AAA!
"
16,7,Nichole,"OH! Oh gosh I'm so sorry!
"
16,7,Token,"Where is everybody? What's goin' on??
"
16,7,Nichole,"Coach wanted me to...  I'm sorry. 
"
16,7,Kyle,"Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?
"
16,7,Jenny,"Yyeah.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
"
16,7,Lola,"She likes... movies, cats.
"
16,7,Jenny,"She likes basketball.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
"
16,7,Lola,"Well- Hey Kyle,  we were headed over to the mall. You wanna go with us?
"
16,7,Kyle,"Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! 
"
16,7,Jenny,"Guess he has a crush on Nichole.
"
16,7,Lola,"I don't think so. I heard Kyle swings for the same team.
"
16,7,Jenny,"Really?
"
16,7,Kyle,"It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 
"
16,7,Token,"Hey! In here! 
"
16,7,Nichole,"You think the janitors are still here?
"
16,7,Token,"Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on. 
"
16,7,Nichole,"Look!  Somebody left a deli platter.  And board games. And massage oil.
"
16,7,Token,"Oh... Good.
"
16,7,Nichole,"Well that was sure an interesting night.
"
16,7,Token,"It sure was.
"
16,7,Nichole,"Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been reeeally scary.
"
16,7,Token,"Yeah. Now that it's over, I.. I guess it was kind of fun. 
"
16,7,Nichole,"Yeahh, it kind of was. Maybe... uh I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Oh my God, this is sooo cute.
"
16,7,Token,"I'd like that.
"
16,7,Nichole,"Cool. Well... thanks again. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Ohhhhh my God.
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"We did it, Eric. We found in each other a ray of sunshine.
"
16,7,Cartman,"You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. 
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"I see the questions in your eyes.
I know what's weighing on your mind.
You can be sure I know, my heart.
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. 
"
16,7,Stan,"Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
"
16,7,Cartman,"I don't know, it's just so... perfect. 
"
16,7,Kyle,"You motherfucker! 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Kyle, Jesus Christ!
"
16,7,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
"
16,7,Kyle,"The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
"
16,7,Kyle,"Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!
"
16,7,Stan,"Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Teehee, that was us, remember, Eric?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
"
16,7,Kyle,"What?!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Nothing.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Who is Cupid Me?!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Nobody.
"
16,7,Kyle,"You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
"
16,7,Kyle,"God-damnit! 
"
16,7,Dad,"Nichole? Your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school.
"
16,7,Nichole,"His name is Token. He's really nice.
"
16,7,Dad,"Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black.
"
16,7,Nichole,"So?
"
16,7,Dad,"Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person.
"
16,7,Mom,"Oh stop, William. There's nothing wrong with her dating a black person.
"
16,7,William,"But I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying... she's gonna have to deal with racist people out there! People turning their heads and saying, ""Oh, look at the two black people together. That figures!""
"
16,7,Nichole,"It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence.
"
16,7,Mom,"And we are very happy for you, sweetheart. Here, have some more turkey.
"
16,7,William,"Yeah, just try the white meat. I know it's a little dry, but... there's a lot more of it.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?! 
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee, heeheehee.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Sorry. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Heeheeheeheeheehee.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"They're fudgey charms of sunshine.
"
16,7,Cartman,"You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! 
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee, teeheeheeheehee. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"I'm gonna get you! 
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Heeheehee, no! 
"
16,7,Cartman,"I almost got you! Almost! 
"
16,7,Liane,"Everything okay, sweetie?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! 
"
16,7,Nichole,"Oh no...
"
16,7,Nichole,"Hey Token.
"
16,7,Token,"Hey Nichole.
"
16,7,Nichole,"Can I talk to you for a sec?
"
16,7,Token,"Sure!  What's up?
"
16,7,Nichole,"Listen, I... ugh, I don't think this is gonna work out.
"
16,7,Token,"Oh.
"
16,7,Nichole,"I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know?
"
16,7,Token,"Okay...
"
16,7,Nichole,"I think you're really great... Ww-we just...
"
16,7,Token,"I think, you're really great.
"
16,7,Nichole,"...I'm sorry.
"
16,7,Token,"Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around. 
"
16,7,Nichole,"Okay. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"It's not fair! They were so... happy!
"
16,7,Butters,"It's gonna be okay, Eric.
"
16,7,Cartman,"It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
"
16,7,Butters,"They'll find love somewhere else.
"
16,7,Cartman,"No, they won't!
"
16,7,Butters,"Yes, they will.
"
16,7,Cartman,"No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee. Looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine.
"
16,7,Cartman,"And you! I should never have believed in you!
"
16,7,Butters,"In...in who, Eric?
"
16,7,Cartman,"I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die! 
"
16,7,Kyle,"Hey man. You okay?
"
16,7,Token,"Yeah.
"
16,7,Kyle,"What happened? It just didn't work out?
"
16,7,Token,"Yeah I guess.
"
16,7,Kyle,"So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?
"
16,7,Token,"Yeah.
"
16,7,Kyle,"So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
"
16,7,Token,"Yeah, we're through.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
"
16,7,Token,"I'm sorry Kyle. I like girls. 
"
16,7,Kyle,"Huh?  Dude, what the fuck?
"
16,7,Announcer,"We'll be back with more of the Jeffersons right after this.
"
16,7,Man,"I work hard, so I need a laxative that works hard too!  I can't be constipated on the job.  That's why I need... Soft Serve.  Because when I'm constipated, sometimes even a hard push isn't enough.  Don't give up. Get back in there and get to work!  'Cause when the going gets tough, the tough gets going!
"
16,7,Cartman,"That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"No, you don't.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"No, you don't. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. 
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Teehee, stop it.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Heeheehee, heeheeheehee,  Heeheeheeheeheeheeheehee.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
"
16,7,William,"I'm sorry, but she's at the Denver Nuggets game.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Denver Nuggets game?
"
16,7,William,"Yeah, she went with a nice white, Jewish boy.
"
16,7,Cartman,"NOOOOOOO! 
"
16,7,Announcer,"Welcome to today's matchup between the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Clippers.  And now, here to sing the National Anthem, country music star Brad Paisley. 
"
16,7,Brad Paisley,"O! say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars-
"
16,7,Cartman,"Nooooooo!
"
16,7,Announcer,"Nuggets fans, please direct your attention to center court and the president of Halitosis Kidz. , who invite you to join the Denver Nuggets in the fight against morbid halitosis in children.  Here to attempt a three-point shot for adolescents with terminally bad breath is  the poster child for Halitosis Kidz, Stacy Muleburg.  And a good try. 
"
16,7,Stacy,"Aaahahahaaaa.
"
16,7,Adults,"Awww! 
"
16,7,Cartman,"NOOOOOOO. 
"
16,7,Guard,"Tickets please.
"
16,7,Cartman,"No time! NOOOOOOO!
"
16,7,Announcer,"We're all set for the tipoff. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. 
"
16,7,Crowd,"Awwwww. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!
"
16,7,Brad,"I swear, Kyle.
"
16,7,Cartman,"I swear, Kyle. 
"
16,7,Nichole,"Where are you going?
"
16,7,Kyle,"That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 
"
16,7,Nichole,"He did that? Oh no.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! It's outside.
"
16,7,Spectator,"What? 
"
16,7,Nichole,"Token. Hey.
"
16,7,Token,"Hi.
"
16,7,Nichole,"Token, I'm so sorry. I thought you were only with me because I'm black.
"
16,7,Token,"I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black. 
"
16,7,Both,"Do you think we could... Do you still want to... 
"
16,7,Nichole,"Maybe we can give it another try?
"
16,7,Token,"There are still people who will look at us funny. That think we're supposed to be together.
"
16,7,Nichole,"Let them look. I don't care.
"
16,7,Token,"I don't care, either. 
"
16,7,Nichole,"I just think you're a great person. The color of your skin doesn't matter.
"
16,7,Token,"YAY! 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Oh my gohhhd, so cute! 
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee, a place for everything, and everything in its place.
"
16,7,Cartman,"That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"That's right, and I found somebody who's just the same as you!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Really?!
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"There she is! 
"
16,7,Cartman,"What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!
"
16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheeheehee, fuck you! 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Hey, stop it!
"
16,7,Stacy,"Haaagh! 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Nooo!
"
16,7,Stacy,"Haahahaagh!
"
16,8,Dan,"Artonius Jackson catches the ball , he's running down the sideline-  Ohhhh!
"
16,8,Randy,"BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!
"
16,8,Dan,"Jackson stops at the 45 and he is slow to get up. 
"
16,8,Randy,"That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
"
16,8,Commentator,"Yeah, Jackson took a real shot and...  well I'm not sure what he's doing now, but uh, it appears as if he's looking for his keys, Dan.
"
16,8,Dan,"Yeah, and that doesn't make a lot of sense, because ever since his concussion in '06, he doesn't even have a license.
"
16,8,Commentator,"Coach Martin is coming over to tell him that now, but Jackson appears to think he's in a car driving home. 
"
16,8,Dan,"Well, during this time out we're happy to be joined by the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Commissioner, a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the NFL. How's the league handling all that?
"
16,8,Goodell,"Well, there certainly are interesting statistics coming out, Dan, and we are deeply concerned, anduh and waiting to see if there's... really any direct correlation between football and head trauma.
"
16,8,Dan,"Oh, and it looks like some of the MFL alumni are takin' the field now. There's All-Pro safety Martin Gregors , and fullback Jim Harris. Looks like his pants are down around his ankles. 
"
16,8,Commentator,"Somebody should let him know. Oh, and Old Surehand Mike Tafthill , who seems to be baking an imaginary cake, Dan.
"
16,8,Dan,"Yeah, not sure if that's meant to be a cake or, or perhaps a, a loaf of bread, but he definitely thinks he's baking something.
"
16,8,Butters,"Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
"
16,8,Stan,"You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
"
16,8,Butters,"That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
"
16,8,Cartman,"That's right, Butters.
"
16,8,Dan,"And with that the Browns are ready to kick it off back to the Broncos
"
16,8,Randy,"All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.
"
16,8,Kyle,"We don't have kickoffs anymore. 
"
16,8,Randy,"Huh?
"
16,8,Stan,"The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
"
16,8,Randy,"Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!
"
16,8,Principal Victoria,"Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?
"
16,8,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, yes, we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions, m'kay?
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!
"
16,8,Mr. Adler,"Bras?
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! 
"
16,8,Linda,"How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!
"
16,8,Mr. Mackey,"Huh. You you think the students would like that?
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it ""sarcastaball""?!
"
16,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hnkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team?
"
16,8,Randy,"Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!
"
16,8,Stan,"Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
"
16,8,Randy,"Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. 
"
16,8,Butters,"I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.
"
16,8,Butters,"Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
"
16,8,Principal Victoria,"How's it going, coach?
"
16,8,Randy,"How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
"
16,8,Principal Victoria,"So you're happy with these changes?
"
16,8,Randy,"Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
"
16,8,Principal Victoria,"Okay. 
"
16,8,Anchor,"Is football safe for your kids? Concerned Parent Randy Marsh says ""No,"" and has started a movement to reform the sport, gathering followers by the hundreds.
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back! 
"
16,8,Anchor,"Showing just how much one concerned parent can do, Marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of Washington.
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! 
"
16,8,Kyle,"This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
"
16,8,Clyde,"I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.
"
16,8,Stan,"This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
"
16,8,Cartman,"Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!
"
16,8,Butters,"Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
"
16,8,Kyle,"We don't even understand how this game is played.
"
16,8,Butters,"This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
"
16,8,Cartman,"That's true.
"
16,8,Butters,"Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
"
16,8,"Clyde, Kenny","Yeah.
"
16,8,Butters,"And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say ""Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!"" And then you give them a smile!
"
16,8,Boys,"Yeah!
"
16,8,Butters,"And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
"
16,8,Boys,"Yeah! Yeah!
"
16,8,Cartman,"Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.
"
16,8,Goodell,"As commissioner of the NFL, I am so thrilled to see our nation's youth embrace sarcastaball over traditional football. Oh, but why stop there? Since football is so barbaric, we should change too. So let's give a biiig welcome to the new coach of the Denver Broncos, Randy Marsh.  Congratulations, Marsh. Good job!
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!
"
16,8,Goodell,"Nice going!
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, no, you nice going! 
"
16,8,Photographer,"Hey guys, how about a nice fucking picture to welcome in the future of sports? 
"
16,8,Announcer,"Welcome to the inaugural game of the National Sarcastaball League! As we bring you today's matchup between the Denver Broncos and the Oakland Raiders.
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! 
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh yeah, good one! 
"
16,8,Announcer,"And now, here are your Denver Whoop de fucking do girls!
"
16,8,Cheerleaders,"Woo! Woo!

16,8,Cheerleader 1,"Go Broncos! Go!
"
16,8,Cheerleader 2,"Whoop de fuckin' do!
"
16,8,Announcer,"And now, here to sing the sarcastaball anthem, recording artist, Cee-Lo!
"
16,8,Cee Lo Green,"I love sarcastaball
It's so much better than football
I'm so glad they got rid of violence in sports
'Cause sarcastaball is so super fun to watch
"
16,8,Fan 1,"Woo! Nice job, Cee-Lo! Good to see you on TV some more!
"
16,8,Fan 2,"Yeah, I'm a big fan of all your hit songs!
"
16,8,Kyle,"Dude, what do you mean ""We don't have a coach.""?
"
16,8,Stan,"Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
"
16,8,Kyle,"But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
"
16,8,Stan,"I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
"
16,8,Clyde,"Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. 
"
16,8,Kyle,"We can't.
"
16,8,Clyde,"We don't have a coach, Kyle.
"
16,8,Cartman,"Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
"
16,8,Butters,"Huh?
"
16,8,Craig,"Hey yeah.
"
16,8,Stan,"The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
"
16,8,Butters,"Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
"
16,8,Cartman,"Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
"
16,8,Butters,"Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
"
16,8,Stan,"Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
"
16,8,Butters,"'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. 
"
16,8,Kyle,"We need you, Butters. You're the man! 
"
16,8,The Team,"Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters!
"
16,8,Fangirls,"Butters, rah, Butters!
"
16,8,A Fangirl,"I love you, Butters!
"
16,8,Butters,"I love you too, ladies. 
"
16,8,Wendy,"Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams.
"
16,8,Red,"Leave him alone, Wendy! He's mine! 
"
16,8,Butters,"Woohoohoohoohoo!
"
16,8,Butters,"Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 
"
16,8,Stephen,"Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night.
"
16,8,Butters,"I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
"
16,8,Stephen,"All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it.
"
16,8,Butters,"Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later. 
"
16,8,Announcer,"The score is zero to zero as the Steelers kick off to the Broncos.
"
16,8,Cheerleader 1,"Go Broncos, Go.
"
16,8,Dan,"Manning has the ball. He's saying some really great things about the other team. Manning met by LaMarr Woodley. He's giving the balloon to Woodley. The referee comes in.  Oh, the referee is calling that a touchdown! Oh wait, now another official is signalling that's a safety!
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!
"
16,8,Dan,"They're gonna have to sort this one out with a side judge. 
"
16,8,Side Judge,"Fuck it, it's a fucking field goal!
"
16,8,Randy,"YEAH!  YEAH! WOO!
"
16,8,Reporter 1,"Coach, three to nothing victory over the Steelers. You must feel like a reeeal winner.
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. 
"
16,8,Reporter 1,"Coach Belichick says,  ""No way we can beat the Broncos. They've had the same coach for almost a day.""
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!
"
16,8,Reporter 2,"Guess we'll find out on Sunday.
"
16,8,Randy,"...Yeah... 
"
16,8,Randy,"All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.
"
16,8,Broncos,"D'awwwww!
"
16,8,Manning,"Practice on Monday after a victory? Great!
"
16,8,Randy,"That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.
"
16,8,Manning,"Practice on Monday? That's just what I wanna do!
"
16,8,Randy,"That's IT! 
"
16,8,Cartman,"Hey Butters, you got a minute?
"
16,8,Butters,"Wuh sure, Eric. 
"
16,8,Cartman,"I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
"
16,8,Butters,"Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
"
16,8,Cartman,"No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
"
16,8,Butters,"Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
"
16,8,Cartman,"...I don't have a dad.
"
16,8,Butters,"...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
"
16,8,Cartman,"Youuu save it all?
"
16,8,Butters,"My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
"
16,8,Cartman,"Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
"
16,8,Butters,"I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 
"
16,8,Cartman,"Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
"
16,8,Butters,"Do you feel warm and compassionate?
"
16,8,Cartman,"Holy shit I think I do.
"
16,8,Jim Rome,"Welcome back to Rome. We're gonna talk some sarcastaball. I can't wait. I can't wait to talk sarcastaball because it's really compelling.  Joining me now is the coach of the Denver Broncos and the inventor of sarcastaball, Randy Marsh. Thanks for calling in, Randy. Really happy to have you on the show.
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.
"
16,8,Jim Rome,"Randy, first off, thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare. Way to go.
"
16,8,Randy,"Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.
"
16,8,Jim Rome,"Well it certainly makes for an exciting game. How about last night's nail-biter that ended zero to zero? That's a game I wanna watch twice. That's a game I wanna watch four times. Check that: I'll watch that game... five times.  Good luck on Sunday. I'm sure that'll be another game that I could watch... twelve times. Check that: thirteen times.
"
16,8,Randy,"Thanks Jim. 
"
16,8,Sharon,"Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?
"
16,8,Sharon,"Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!
"
16,8,Sharon,"I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.
"
16,8,Randy,"Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!
"
16,8,Sharon,"Do you mean that?
"
16,8,Randy,"Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.
"
16,8,Butters,"All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 
"
16,8,Spectators,"Awwwwww!
"
16,8,Stan,"Cartman, you idiot!
"
16,8,Butters,"Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
"
16,8,Cartman,"That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
"
16,8,Clyde,"Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.
"
16,8,Butters,"Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 
"
16,8,Doctor,"Uh hum. Mmm.  I'm sorry, Mr. Marsh, but there appears to be permanent damage.
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.
"
16,8,Sharon,"How do we fix this, doctor?
"
16,8,Doctor,"You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain.
"
16,8,Randy,"So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! 
"
16,8,Doctor,"Ohh, rreally? You, you think there's a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball?  Really?  That's fascinating. Please, go on.
"
16,8,Randy,"No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.
"
16,8,Doctor,"You know, I have a 50-year-old Alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family, but... let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains.
"
16,8,Randy,"My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
"
16,8,Doctor,"Okay, well I've got a better idea. Let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases, let's, let's take all that money and make commercials that say ""Hey America, sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain.""
"
16,8,Randy,"Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much! 
"
16,8,Jim Rome,"Jim Rome here. Hey, I love sarcastaball just as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's so thrilling I need an extra burst of energy to get me through a game. That's when I reach for a bottle of this.  Butters' Creamy Goo. 
"
16,8,Voice-Over,"You play hard. You need a sports drink that gives you that extra boost.  Sports these days are all about being nice, so take your game to the next level . With Butters' Creamy Goo.  You'll be filled with feelings of good tidings and be nicer than a ray of sunshine. 
"
16,8,Butters,"Like me!
"
16,8,Jim Rome,"Get with it, and get the Goo!
"
16,8,Voice-Over,"Butters' Creamy Goo is chock full of all the essentials an athlete needs. Commitment! Compassion! And Comradery! And now it's available in quart size!
"
16,8,Singer,"Go and chug a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo!
"
16,8,Voice-Over,"Best served just above room temperature.
"
16,8,Butters,"42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 
"
16,8,Randy,"STAN?! Stan! 
"
16,8,Stan,"Dad?
"
16,8,Randy,"Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!
"
16,8,Stan,"What?
"
16,8,Sharon,"We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore.
"
16,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hey, get off the field! M'kay?! 
"
16,8,Randy,"Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!
"
16,8,Sharon,"Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!
"
16,8,Stan,"Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!
"
16,8,Sharon,"Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?
"
16,8,Stan,"Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!
"
16,8,Sharon,"Ohohh Randy, it's happening! 
"
16,8,Butters,"Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
"
16,8,Randy,"Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!
"
16,8,Stan,"We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says ""Competitiveness can be compassionate,"" he's being completely sincere?
"
16,8,Randy,"I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
"
16,8,Cartman,"That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
"
16,8,Stan,"Yeah Dad. You need some of this. 
"
16,8,Randy,"... This is cum. 
"
16,8,Stephen,"And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done!  Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to ""Oh, who don't we just drink each other's cum?""! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!
"
16,8,Butters,"What's sarcasm and what's com?
"
16,8,Stephen,"We'll talk about that when you're older!
"
16,8,Randy,"Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. 
"
16,8,Jim Rome,"Welcome back to Rome. Some of you might have seen me on TV last night. Turns out the drink I endorsed was semen. Turns out a little kid was just bein' sarcastic. That kid's probably grounded for a month. Check that: I'm sure he's grounded for two months. And a week. Football needs to be made safer, so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen? Yeah, that's a fastball right there. That's a real stroke of philosophic genius! More little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football, and I don't know what else to say but ""So long, sarcastaball, it was nice knowin' you."" Let's just hope nothin' like this ever happens again. Probably won't. Not for another year. Check that: couple of days.
"
16,8,Butters,"DAD! Hey Dad!
"
16,8,Stephen,"What?!
"
16,8,Butters,"My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
"
16,8,Stephen,"Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend.
"
16,8,Butters,"Thanks, Dad.
"
16,9,Stan,"You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?
"
16,9,Cartman,"Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? 
"
16,9,Kyle,"Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
"
16,9,Cartman,"I'm not fat, Kyle.
"
16,9,Kyle,"Right, you're not fat.
"
16,9,Cartman,"Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! 
"
16,9,Stan,"Whoa duude!
"
16,9,Kyle,"Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? 
"
16,9,Obese Man,"Excuse me.  Excuse me! 
"
16,9,Cartman,"See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
"
16,9,Kyle,"Why do they even allow those things in stored?
"
16,9,Stan,"They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"You've gotta be kidding me!
"
16,9,Cartman,"Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!
"
16,9,Kyle,"Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 
"
16,9,Obese Lady,"Are those Candy Corn Oreos?
"
16,9,Cartman,"Yeah... Yeah, here you go. 
"
16,9,Cartman,"Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
"
16,9,Kyle,"Why? 
"
16,9,Cartman,"I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying ""No, I'm big-boned"" or ""no, that's just muscle""... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
"
16,9,Kyle,"Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
"
16,9,Cartman,"No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!
"
16,9,Kyle,"Oh no!
"
16,9,Cartman,"Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"You don't need that! Get off of it.
"
16,9,Cartman,"Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
"
16,9,Cartman,"Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"What??
"
16,9,Cartman,"Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"So take a shit somewhere else!
"
16,9,Cartman,"That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.
"
16,9,Gerald,"What's going on down here?
"
16,9,Cartman,"Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. 
"
16,9,Cartman,"Out of the way. Out of the way please. 
"
16,9,Greeter,"Uhh I guess take that big booth by the window. 
"
16,9,Ticket Teller,"Okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. Anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- Oh...
"
16,9,Cartman,"Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!
"
16,9,Legless Boy,"I don't have legs.
"
16,9,Cartman,"Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.
"
16,9,Cartman,"And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
"
16,9,Anchor,"More lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo. Property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms, costing taxpayers millions. Opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of Rascal tipping.
"
16,9,Obese Man 2,"Stop it you kids! sto- Oop- Owww. Weak! Weak!
"
16,9,Anchor,"The government warns that Rascal tipping can be dangerous, and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor. To counter the crisis, the Department of Health has called for $25 million in aid, so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device. 
"
16,9,Cartman,"Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"You have got to be kidding me!
"
16,9,Cartman,"What, Kyle?! 
"
16,9,Kyle,"We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
"
16,9,Cartman,"You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
"
16,9,Kyle,"So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
"
16,9,Cartman,"Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
"
16,9,Kyle,"Who's Honey Boo Boo?
"
16,9,Stan,"Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?
"
16,9,Honey Boo Boo,"My name's Honey Boo Boo and I'm a beauty queen, bitches.  I'm fat as a whale and I don't give two shits, girl!
"
16,9,Mama,"Her favorite foods are sketti and butter, and she likes drinkin' Red Bull and Mountain Dew.
"
16,9,Honey Boo Boo,"I'm only six and I've already had three heart attacks, girlfriend!
"
16,9,Mama,"Come on! Come on now, Boo Boo!  Now get up and wave to them judges!  We ain't got no shame about our weight, 'cause our weight makes us sassy. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
"
16,9,Stan,"Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
"
16,9,James Cameron,"This is it! Throttle down!
"
16,9,A crewman,"Throttle down! 
"
16,9,Crewman 1,"Mr. Cameron, you don't have to do this! Why don't you just go back to your house in Malibu? Go work on another movie?
"
16,9,James Cameron,"I have to do this! I have to try and raise it!
"
16,9,Crewman 1,"The bar isn't something that actually lowers, Mr. Cameron.
"
16,9,James Cameron,"Then how do you explain all the fat people on mobility scooters?  How do YOU account for... Honey Boo Boo? The bar has been lowered to depths we can't even fathom. If anyone can go down there and raise it back, it's ME.  Let her go!  UV lights on. Pressure system is normal. Music, on.
"
16,9,Singers,"His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron.
"
16,9,James Cameron,"Systems are normal. You guys hearing the song okay up there?
"
16,9,Singers,"James (James) Cameron, explorer of the sea
"
16,9,Crewman 1,"Yes, James, we hear the song.
"
16,9,James Cameron,"Descending to one thousand feet. I don't see the bar yet. Looks like it must have sunk pretty low.
"
16,9,Singers,"With a dying thirst to be the first. Could it be? Yeah it's him. James Cameron.
"
16,9,Kyle,"Come on, hurry it up in there! 
"
16,9,Cartman,"Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
"
16,9,Token,"Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.
"
16,9,Kyle,"Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
"
16,9,Token,"Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.
"
16,9,Kyle,"Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?
"
16,9,Token,"At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.
"
16,9,Kyle,"You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.
"
16,9,Token,"Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.
"
16,9,Kyle,"Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 
"
16,9,Craig,"Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth.
"
16,9,Token,"He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 
"
16,9,Token,"He's chubby,  he's filthy , and he's just a little bit nuts.  Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! 
"
16,9,Kyle,"Fatty Doo Doo?
"
16,9,Randy Newman,"Who's that scootin' on a scooter? Fatty Doo Doo
Who's got doodoo like a fatty scoop de do?
"
16,9,Kyle,"What?
"
16,9,Randy Newman,"Nobody scoots a fatty doo like you do.
Scatty foo foo
Patty poo poo
White president, black president, I don't care.
Just scoop me up some doodoo and I'll be right there.
I. Only. Know. Five. Chords. Six-
"
16,9,Token,"Come in.
"
16,9,Kyle,"What have you done?
"
16,9,Token,"I helped you make a documentary, Kyle.
"
16,9,Kyle,"When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
"
16,9,Token,"Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.
"
16,9,Kyle,"You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
"
16,9,Token,"I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?
"
16,9,Kyle,"When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
"
16,9,Token,"But she's not black, Kyle. She's white.  The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up.  Not by us, or anyone else.
"
16,9,James Cameron,"You guys seeing this?!
"
16,9,Crewman 1,"Yes, we see, Mr. Cameron.
"
16,9,James Cameron,"This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five.
"
16,9,Kyle,"I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
"
16,9,Stan,"I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
"
16,9,Kyle,"Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
"
16,9,Stan,"Dude! Dude, not cool!
"
16,9,Kyle,"What?
"
16,9,Stan,"Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
"
16,9,Kyle,"What? Oh my God.
"
16,9,Stan,"Yeah dude. It's really serious.
"
16,9,Mama,"Well, the doctor said Honey Boo Boo needs a heart transplant. They're gonna do a surgery and put a pig heart in her, so, we're going to the ranch to pick out a hog.
"
16,9,Honey Boo Boo,"I'mm gettin' a piiig heaaart.
"
16,9,Mama,"Honey Boo Boo is gonna do pageants with a pig heart, we wanna pick a hog that has pizzazz and knows how to work it, girl!
"
16,9,Honey Boo Boo,"I waunt that one!
"
16,9,Farmer,"This one here?  You want this one??
"
16,9,Honey Boo Boo,"Yeah! No wait! That pig over there gave me the evil eye! I wuant that one! I waunt  that one!
"
16,9,Farmer,"This one?  this one right here?? Ya waunt this one??
"
16,9,Honey Boo Boo,"I want that one's heart! It looked at me funny!
"
16,9,Mama,"We've been in the OR about two hours already. I just hope when she does her pageants the judges don't take away points 'cause she's got a pig heart.  Honey Boo Boo!  Honey BOO BOO!
"
16,9,Honey Boo Boo,"What?!
"
16,9,Mama,"What you gonna tell them judges if they ask you about your heart?
"
16,9,Honey Boo Boo,"I'm gonna tell them ""my heart is sweeter than bacon, child!"" 
"
16,9,Mama,"Who waunts sketti and butter?  She got a pig heart an' now she thinks she's a pachyderm. Show 'em your scar!
"
16,9,Honey Boo Boo,"This is myyy scaaar 'cause I got a pig heart. My scar makes me sassy, child! 
"
16,9,James Cameron,"S. S. Cameron? This is James Cameron. I am now at... 16,000 feet. You should see the cold darkness of it all. The isolation and yet awwwe of the sea's magnitude. I have now sunk deeper than any human has ever been before! 
"
16,9,Randy Newman,"We are here in the ocean depths goin' deep deep deep-  Oh hey James Cameron.
"
16,9,James Cameron,"What the fuck?!
"
16,9,Randy Newman,"I've been divin' in the deep and I'm feelin' so cheap.
"
16,9,James Cameron,"You son of a bitch Newman! How did you beat me down here!
"
16,9,Randy Newman,"I don't want anyone raisin' the bar, 'cause nobody'll hire me! Deep deep deep in the ocean. Ohhh, come on. Fight me, Cameron.
"
16,9,James Cameron,"Alright, you son of a bitch! I'll take you to hell! 
"
16,9,Cartman,"It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
"
16,9,Kyle,"I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
"
16,9,Cartman,"Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!
"
16,9,Token,"It actually aired last night.
"
16,9,Kyle,"You found a network to buy it?
"
16,9,Token,"Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.
"
16,9,Cartman,"What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
"
16,9,Token,"Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-
"
16,9,Cartman,"I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! 
"
16,9,Announcer,"We welcome you to the First Lady's Symposium on Obesity, with your keynote speaker, Michelle Obama. 
"
16,9,Michelle Obama,"Our country is in the midst of an epidemic. Recently a very big conflict was brought to my attention.  A conflict that illustrates without a doubt what should be our nation's number one priority. What will we do as a country? I cannot give you any easy answers. But what I can give you, is what we've all been waiting for! Honey Boo Boo versus Fatty Poo Poo! 
"
16,9,Cartman,"You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!
"
16,9,Token,"That's good, Fatty, get pissed!
"
16,9,Cartman,"I'm pissed!
"
16,9,Token,"Yeah, Fatty!
"
16,9,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
"
16,9,Mama,"Ain't nobody can beat my Boo Boo at sketti wrestlin'! 
"
16,9,Michelle Obama,"Let's do this! 
"
16,9,Honey Boo Boo,"Ow!
"
16,9,Cartman,"I ain't done with you, bitch!
"
16,9,Man,"Yeah! Tip assist!
"
16,9,Crewman 2,"You think he's dead? 
"
16,9,Crewman 3,"I hope so.
"
16,9,James Cameron,"S.S. Cameron! This is James Cameron! I've found it! My God I found the bar!  Divert all power to sub systems! Two percent oxygen left!  The bar is too heavy! Aaaaagh! Come on you bitch!
"
16,9,Crewman 4,"Well I'll be damned.
"
16,9,Stan,"Dude, you okay? 
"
16,9,Kyle,"I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. 
"
16,9,Man 2,"Rrrgh it's like, I can't explain it. I just suddenly feel like this isn't right. 
"
16,9,Man 3,"I don't know why we were watchin' that garbage in the first place. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"Huh?
"
16,9,Aide,"Ms. Obama, are you, uh, ma'am? Are you okay?
"
16,9,Michelle Obama,"Something's wrong. This... This is all wrong!  Stop! Everyone! What are we doing?! How can you let this happen to your daughter?!
"
16,9,Mama,"I don't know, I... How did I let myself go like this? What have I done??
"
16,9,Man 4,"When did we devolve into watching fat kids sketti wrestling?
"
16,9,Michelle Obama,"We need to realize obesity is an epidemic. But it's not a disease. From now on I'm going to dedicate this administration to FIGHTING childhood obesity! 
"
16,9,Cartman,"Oh! You fucking bitch! 
"
16,9,Token,"What the hell is going on?
"
16,9,Kyle,"I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
"
16,9,Crewman 5,"Hey Cameron, we can't believe it.
"
16,9,James Cameron,"We're done here! Set course for the set of Avatar 2
"
16,9,Crewman 6,"Mr. Cameron.  People should know. How you saved us all? How you raised the bar? How will they know what a hero you are?
"
16,9,James Cameron,"James Cameron doesn't do what James Cameron does for James Cameron.  James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron is... James Cameron. 
"
16,9,Singers,"His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron.
"
16,10,Announcer,"Erectile dysfunction is a fact of life. You want to show her you love her, but you're old, and so is she.  The next time that special moment comes, don't let your sex drive fail you just because your wife looks like a shriveled prune. Fake it, with Cialis.  It won't make her any harder, but it will make you not care for up to three hours.  And then you can still have your own separate bathrub from her later on. 
"
16,10,Gerald,"Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?
"
16,10,Sheila,"Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?
"
16,10,Gerald,"How about I put on the uniform?
"
16,10,Sheila,"Oh, Gerald...
"
16,10,Gerald,"Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.
"
16,10,Sheila,"Oh, hello. 
"
16,10,Gerald,"UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.
"
16,10,Sheila,"Oh, dear, but I'm barely dressed.
"
16,10,Gerald,"If you'll just...  sign right here. 
"
16,10,Sheila,"Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!
"
16,10,Gerald,"Yeah?  Do you like your package, ma'am? 
"
16,10,Sheila,"Oh yes!
"
16,10,Gerald,"Huh? 
"
16,10,Sheila,"Do it harder, UPS man!
"
16,10,Kyle,"Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
"
16,10,Ike,"Yes! Yes!
"
16,10,Kyle,"I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
"
16,10,Ike,"I saw them, Kyle, I saw them!
"
16,10,Kyle,"Oh no...
"
16,10,Kyle,"You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
"
16,10,Stan,"Dude, what happened?
"
16,10,Kyle,"Take a look. 
"
16,10,Stan,"What's this? 
"
16,10,Kyle,"Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
"
16,10,Stan,"Whoa!
"
16,10,Cartman,"Dude, no way!
"
16,10,Kyle,"Yeah dude. 
"
16,10,Stan,"But are you sure they had sex, like, ""sex"" sex, or they actually had sex? 
"
16,10,Kyle,"Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
"
16,10,Randy,"Ohhhh... 
"
16,10,Stan,"Well are you gonna tell your dad?
"
16,10,Kyle,"I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
"
16,10,Kyle,"What?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
"
16,10,Stan,"Cartman dude, not now.
"
16,10,Cartman,"No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? ""Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight."" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
"
16,10,Randy,"Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?
"
16,10,Jimbo,"How do you tell him? ""Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife."" It's really none of our business.
"
16,10,Stuart,"If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!
"
16,10,Stephen,"How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who clearly has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything!
"
16,10,Randy,"Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?
"
16,10,Mechanic,"Wouldn't be the first time.  Hyeah, there's a price to be paid with having things convenient. Used to be... a man had to go to the store to buy himself a pitcher of milk. Hyeah, but men got lazy. They wanted that milk delivered right to the door. Only problem was, the guy deliverin' that milk end sup fuckin' your wife. Sure, you had your nice cold milk delivered right to your doorstep, but your wife was gettin' pounded out like a mallard duck.  And now you got your Amazon.  And the milkman's come back.  And none of ya are safe. 
"
16,10,Security Agent,"And so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen, the touch pads at the front and rear doors, and break-in monitors on all windows. I'm afraid those are not secure at all.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh no, really?
"
16,10,Liane,"Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
"
16,10,Liane,"Ohhh...
"
16,10,Security Agent,"Yes, unfortunately it's not enough to just be fearful of strangers these days.
"
16,10,Cartman,"What-what do you mean?
"
16,10,Security Agent,"Well, many times, houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!
"
16,10,Security Agent,"We realize that's a lot of money, Mrs. Cartman, but really, how much is feeling secure in your own home worth?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
"
16,10,Sharon,"Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?
"
16,10,Randy,"No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it. 
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Hey there, looks like I got a couple of packagers from Amazon for ya.
"
16,10,Randy,"Oh, is that so?
"
16,10,UPS Man,"If I can just get your signature right  there?
"
16,10,Randy,"Sure um... Chad, is it?
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Thad.
"
16,10,Randy,"Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Oh you know, just, tryin' to get to everyone.
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah I'll bet. 
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Well, have a good one.
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.
"
16,10,Sharon,"Ooooo, stuff from Amazon?
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah, w-what are they?
"
16,10,Sharon,"You know, to be honest, I can't remember?
"
16,10,Randy,"You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?
"
16,10,Sharon,"Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy.  oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. 
"
16,10,Randy,"Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?
"
16,10,Jeff,"This is Jeff with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
"
16,10,Jeff,"That's okay. Do you have your security pass phrase you can tell me?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.
"
16,10,Jeff,"Okay, I've got something a little different here.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
"
16,10,Jeff,"No problem.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Sorry about this.
"
16,10,Jeff,"It's all right, it happens all the time.
"
16,10,Cartman,"'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean ""That's all right""! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
"
16,10,Jeff,"You want to rape your mom?
"
16,10,Cartman,"That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!
"
16,10,Jeff,"You said you lived there.
"
16,10,Cartman,"I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
"
16,10,Randy,"How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?
"
16,10,Mechanic,"There's no getting rid of him. Not in any you folks would be prepared for. Noh, best you just let him go on fucking your wives. Maybe he'll get tired of it.
"
16,10,Stephen,"Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore!  This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: I had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with me now.
"
16,10,Randy,"You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?
"
16,10,Mechanic,"We used a pretty blonde to lure him in. When she answered the door she told the milkman to follow her to the bathrub. She took off her clothes and... asked the milkman to fill the tub with milk. The milkman said, ""You want that milk pasteurize?"" And the blonde replied, ""No, just up to my boobs. I can splash it in my eyes."" That's when we jumped 'im. It was over in minutes. Then we burned his body. You wanna get rid of the milkman? You gotta kill him and kill him good. And then you gotta go to the store for your stuff from then on.
"
16,10,Cat Burglar,"Hey, ey uh,  you want me to do this, you gotta pay up front, kid!
"
16,10,Cartman,"You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?
"
16,10,Michael,"This is Michael with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!
"
16,10,Michael,"Oh-kay, should we contact the police?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
"
16,10,Michael,"Okay, we're contacting them now.
"
16,10,Cartman,"He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
"
16,10,Michael,"Try and stay calm, the police are on their way.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Hey there, misterrr Stotch. looks like another Amazon package. 
"
16,10,Stephen,"I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell.
"
16,10,UPS Man,"...Sss-sorry?
"
16,10,Stephen,"Just let me sign.  All right, he's coming to you.
"
16,10,Voice,"Hell hello there, Mr. UPS man!
"
16,10,UPS Man,"What are you-?
"
16,10,Randy,"You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Look, you can have whatever's in the back! Ih-ihit's all stuff from Amazon!
"
16,10,Randy,"Oh no, pull in here.
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Just let me go, huh?
"
16,10,Randy,"Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! 
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Aaawwgh! 
"
16,10,Stephen,"You should have never come to our town! 
"
16,10,Stuart,"A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man. 
"
16,10,Woman,"Oh my God.
"
16,10,Man,"Come on honey! 
"
16,10,Randy,"Thought we wouldn't find out??? 
"
16,10,Cartman,"Who is there?
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Please! 
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?
"
16,10,Varashnu,"Hello, this is Varashnu wit Wolf Home Security.
"
16,10,Cartman,"A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
"
16,10,Varashnu,"...Uh yes, I am in United States.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
"
16,10,Varashnu,"Okay, hold on. 
"
16,10,Cartman,"Heh- hello?
"
16,10,Kevin,"This is Kevin with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
"
16,10,Cartman,"No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
"
16,10,Kevin,"We have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute. That takes a lot of employees manning phones.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
"
16,10,Kevin,"Sir, it doesn't matter where we call you from, we still contact the police in your neighborhood.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
"
16,10,Kevin,"I d-I d'uh... Wow, that just fucked my head.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! 
"
16,10,Sgt. Yates,"All right, quiet down people, please! Quiet!  I know you're all worried about your families' security. All I can tell you is that so far, Bane has not been caught. 
"
16,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, what are we supposed to do? I mean if Bane is out there on the loose then none of us are safe. One Bane's bad enough, but apparently we got like, like seven Banes? Uhkay?
"
16,10,Gerald,"And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
"
16,10,Randy,"Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.
"
16,10,Gerald,"What?
"
16,10,Randy,"Huh? Nothing.
"
16,10,Sgt. Yates,"Now listen! There's nothing more we can do to protect your homes. But there's someone here who says he can. 
"
16,10,Security Agent,"Hello folks, we're more than happy to get your homes safe and secure. Now, you're gonna be wanting monitors on all your doors and windows, motion detectors in the living areas, and I would also recommend you all get our newest personal security system to make sure your wives are safe outside the home.
"
16,10,Randy,"Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?
"
16,10,Spokesman,"Protecting your home and your family is hard enough! But sometimes alarms on your doors and windows aren't enough! A new security system allows not only for your doors and windows to be monitored, but your fear levels as well.  A security system that is actually inside you. It's called IN-security.
"
16,10,Husband,"We'll never forget the day we took our twin daughters to the beach.
"
16,10,Stranger,"Hehey, what cute twins.
"
16,10,Wife,"Thanks.
"
16,10,Stranger,"They're so adorable  that I'm gonna bash their fucking heads in! 
"
16,10,Peter,"This is Peter with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
"
16,10,Husband,"A white man just tried to murder our twin girls.
"
16,10,Peter,"I have a police car on their way with blankets and cocoa. 
"
16,10,Husband,"I only hope other have people have INsecurity to protect their families.
"
16,10,Shoe Salesman,"Well, how's the shoe fit, pal?
"
16,10,Boy,"I think it fits pretty good.
"
16,10,Shoe Salesman,"Well okayhehe, let's see if it fits better than this KNIFE THROUGH YOUR FUCKING SKULL, BASTARD?! 
"
16,10,Boy,"Aaahh! 
"
16,10,Mom,"Hello?
"
16,10,David,"This is David with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
"
16,10,Mom,"No, a while shoe salesman tried to murder my son.
"
16,10,David,"Hold tight. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa. 
"
16,10,Spokesman,"Don't let your family become another statistic. Have piece of mind with...  INsecurity.
"
16,10,Kyle,"It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
"
16,10,Stan,"You're gonna have to tell him, dude.
"
16,10,Kyle,"I know...
"
16,10,Cartman,"HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! 
"
16,10,Kyle,"What?!
"
16,10,Cartman,"Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
"
16,10,Kyle,"Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!
"
16,10,Kyle,"The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
"
16,10,Cartman,"What?  Hello?
"
16,10,Marcus,"This is Marcus with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
"
16,10,Marcus,"All right, could I just get your password please?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
"
16,10,Marcus,"I love boobs?
"
16,10,Cartman,"No, ""uloveboobs."" Lower-case u love boobs.
"
16,10,Marcus,"How did you know that?
"
16,10,Cartman,"My password is uloveboobs!
"
16,10,Marcus,"Oh oh I get it. That's pretty funny.
"
16,10,Cartman,"You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
"
16,10,Marcus,"Sure, here you go. 
"
16,10,Cartman,"Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.
"
16,10,Randy,"And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.
"
16,10,Stuart,"Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again.
"
16,10,Jimbo,"He's back!
"
16,10,Stephen,"What?!
"
16,10,Jimbo,"I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!
"
16,10,Stephen,"How?
"
16,10,Jimbo,"He casually dropped this on his way out! 
"
16,10,Randy,"Oh my God! 
"
16,10,Mechanic,"Didn't kill 'im, did ya?  Yea', I didn't think you had it in ya.
"
16,10,Randy,"We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
"
16,10,Mechanic,"Milkman don't get scared. Not with free pussy at every doorstep.
"
16,10,Stephen,"Son of a bitch, it's him all right!
"
16,10,Randy,"This guy doesn't know when to quit!
"
16,10,Stephen,"He's stopping at another house. 
"
16,10,Mr. Black,"Guess this guy's a lot tougher than we thought. Must be why our wives want him so bad.
"
16,10,Randy,"Sorry sorry, that's me.  Hello?
"
16,10,Alvin,"This is Alvin with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.
"
16,10,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
"
16,10,Sheila,"That's right, Kyle.
"
16,10,Kyle,"And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Uhh, hi, I got a delivery for ya?
"
16,10,Kyle,"Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
"
16,10,UPS Man,"What?
"
16,10,Kyle,"Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?
"
16,10,UPS Man,"What's going on?
"
16,10,Kyle,"You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Don't you think I want to?!  I hate this damned town! Every day, things just keep getting weirder around here, and I'm just about sick of it! Aaah!  Oh my God!  Hello?
"
16,10,Brian,"This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
"
16,10,UPS Man,"No! They blew up my car! They blew up my car!
"
16,10,Brian,"I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.
"
16,10,UPS Man,"They're after me again! Do something!
"
16,10,Brian,"Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in.  This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
"
16,10,Gerald,"What the hell's goin' on out here?! 
"
16,10,Jimbo,"Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!
"
16,10,Gerald,"What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo! 
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Somebody answer me! You have to send help now!
"
16,10,Martin,"Sir, we are sending help. Just stay calm.  Hang on sir, this is Martin with INsecurity.
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.
"
16,10,Martin,"Hello, this is Martin with INsecu-
"
16,10,Cartman,"God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? 
"
16,10,Mike,"This is Mike with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
"
16,10,UPS Man,"Hello?!
"
16,10,Kyle,"Dude, come down here!
"
16,10,UPS Man,"AAAAH!  Uf. 
"
16,10,Sgt. Yates,"So you say this man killed himself because he was a psychopath who was forced to have sex with his mother? 
"
16,10,Stephen,"Yes, we found that in his pocket. 
"
16,10,Officer,"Sir, we found this in the closet upstairs? 
"
16,10,Gerald,"Yes, that's mine.
"
16,10,Randy,"Yours? What?
"
16,10,Gerald,"Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!
"
16,10,Kyle,"Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
"
16,10,Gerald,"Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs. 
"
16,10,The Men,"Hello?
"
16,10,Randy,"It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
"
16,10,Mechanic,"Yea'. Got yourselves some nice home security systems, don'tcha? Payin' a man to do your job of protecting your house. Only problem is, while you're out feelin' like your things are safe, that security man is fucking your wife.
"
16,10,Security Agent,"Doors and windows should be armed and your motion detectors are up and running, just call me whenever you need me back.  Ah! Who are you??
"
16,10,Cartman,"It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. 
"
16,10,Security Agent,"Hoo!
"
16,11,Cartman,"FELLAS! Fellas!
"
16,11,Stan,"What?
"
16,11,Cartman,"You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
"
16,11,Kyle,"Butters?  Why?
"
16,11,Cartman,"It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
"
16,11,Stan,"You're talking about Butters.
"
16,11,Cartman,"Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! 
"
16,11,Stan,"Butters?
"
16,11,Butters,"Leave me alone!
"
16,11,Stan,"Butters, come out here.
"
16,11,Butters,"Get out of here, all of ya! 
"
16,11,Kyle,"Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
"
16,11,Butters,"You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
"
16,11,Cartman,"Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? 
"
16,11,Butters,"And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
"
16,11,Cartman,"...Wow.
"
16,11,Butters,"Double wow! 
"
16,11,Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse.
"
16,11,Stephen,"Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!
"
16,11,Butters,"I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
"
16,11,Linda,"Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!
"
16,11,Butters,"I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
"
16,11,Stephen,"Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?!
"
16,11,Butters,"Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 
"
16,11,Linda,"Stephen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
"
16,11,Stephen,"Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua.
"
16,11,Principal Victoria,"Eh-excuse me?
"
16,11,Stephen,"Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault.
"
16,11,Butters,"It's not?!
"
16,11,Stephen,"It has to do with... biology.  You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids.
"
16,11,Butters,"Yeah?
"
16,11,Stephen,"You probably think Butters seems somehow... different.
"
16,11,Butters,"Hey yeah, all the time.
"
16,11,Stephen,"It's because he is.  His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place.
"
16,11,Principal Victoria,"Ah I'm sorry, I really don't understand.
"
16,11,Stephen,"Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing.
"
16,11,Linda,"I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!
"
16,11,Stephen,"It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do!
"
16,11,Linda,"Then we can go with him.
"
16,11,Stephen,"You know that's not allowed!
"
16,11,Butters,"Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
"
16,11,Stephen,"Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa.
"
16,11,Butters,"Uhbu-but I'm from here.
"
16,11,Stephen,"No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters.  A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.
"
16,11,Butters,"We're from Hawaii?
"
16,11,Stephen,"Only haoles pronounce it Hawaii, Butters, but those of us from Hava'i are a very special people. We have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive.  We drink chi-chi's from the coconut. We eat poke that the Safeway provides. And when we've chosen a mate, we marry at the fern grotto, as your mother and I did so... very long ago. As a Stotch, Butters, you are actually Hawaiian royalty. Your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the King. 
"
16,11,Butters,"But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
"
16,11,Stephen,"Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called ""hapahui apahoha"", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone.  Take this, son. It is our Mahalo Rewards card. It will provide you with all you need. And now I must turn my back on you. 
"
16,11,Cartman,"Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. 
"
16,11,Kyle,"What?
"
16,11,Cartman,"Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
"
16,11,Stan,"Hawaii?
"
16,11,Cartman,"He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
"
16,11,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
"
16,11,Stan,"After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. 
"
16,11,Kyle,"Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
"
16,11,Kenny,"(I'm not his best friend.)
"
16,11,Cartman,"Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. 
"
16,11,Kenny,"(Butters, come on.)
"
16,11,Butters,"They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 
"
16,11,Kenny,"(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)
"
16,11,Teller,"I already told him, I can't allow anyone on the aircraft who appears to be intoxicated.
"
16,11,Butters,"I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just ""deligerent"" because of my hapanuanalua!
"
16,11,Kenny,"(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)
"
16,11,Teller,"Tell you what: there's plenty of points on his Mahalo Rewards card. If you wanna fly with him, I can let him go.
"
16,11,Kenny,"(Me?)
"
16,11,Butters,"Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
"
16,11,Kenny,"(Okay, okay! I'll go.) 
"
16,11,Butters,"Well, we're here, now what do I do? 
"
16,11,Officer,"Can I help you with anything?
"
16,11,Butters,"Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
"
16,11,Officer,"Okay, were you wit a cruise ship or land tour group?
"
16,11,Butters,"Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 
"
16,11,Blond Man,"Butters Stotch?
"
16,11,Butters,"Yeah?
"
16,11,Blond Man,"Welcome home, young keiki. Your parents said you would be coming for your ceremony.  Ah- uh, who's this?
"
16,11,Butters,"Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.
"
16,11,Older Woman,"Butters, native Hawaiians don't really approve of haoles coming to their ceremonies.
"
16,11,Butters,"Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
"
16,11,Blond Man,"Very well, we shall speak with the chief of our island and see. Come now. 
"
16,11,Butters,"You folks are all native Hawaiians too?
"
16,11,Older Man,"Yes. My wife Patty and I have been coming to Kaua'i for almost five years, and Bill and Donna actually own a time share in Poipu.
"
16,11,Donna,"Yes, but Poipu is getting pretty overrun with tourists, I'm afraid.
"
16,11,Blond Man,"Let us eat.
"
16,11,Older Man,"Oh yea, let us eat.  Aloha, five order of saimin, please.
"
16,11,Butters,"What's ""saimin""?
"
16,11,Patty,"It's one of the foods of our people.
"
16,11,Older Man,"Oh, I get 20% off, I'm a native. Here's my Mahalo Rewards card.  Mahalo.  Come on, you frickin' tourist! Jesus, buy a post card!  These are the ancient ruins of our ancestors.  They say the spirit of the king is still in there.
"
16,11,Blond Man,"You must stay away from this place. It is kapu.
"
16,11,Brunet Man,"Kapu. that means ""taboo"",  especially to haoles! 
"
16,11,Older Man,"Uh that there is Bubba's Burgers.  In Havai'i us natives say ""Bubba's Bruk"".  Here's the Sheraton, just another megahotel for the throngs of tourists. Here's where many of us natives live. The Sheraton Residences.  It's all right, we're natives.  Protector and Chief, I present to you the keiki, Butters Stotch.
"
16,11,Chief,"Ah, Stephen and Linda's child. Last time I saw you, you were the size of a coconut. Who's the haole?
"
16,11,Kenny,"My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.
"
16,11,Stan,"""On the morrow""? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
"
16,11,Kenny,"To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth.
"
16,11,Chief,"In the time-honored traditions of our ancestors, we honor the native Hawaiian Butters Stotch with his hapa noa.  The shark-tooth necklace represents your connection to our island.  Now drink the chi-chi! 
"
16,11,Butters,"Whoa, it's like gasoline!
"
16,11,Chief,"Drink, young keiki, and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away.
"
16,11,Butters,"Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
"
16,11,Chief,"O spirits of ancestors, we ask that you bless this native Hawaiian with his hapa noa! We ask that you-
"
16,11,Blond Man,"Listen!  Listen everyone! I have terrible, horrible news!
"
16,11,Chief,"Do you realize that you are interrupting a hapa noa?
"
16,11,Blond Man,"I've just come from the front office! The Mahalo Rewards card is... 
"
16,11,Chief,"What?! What has happened? Speak!
"
16,11,Blond Man,"The Mahalo Rewards card is being eliminated! They're trying to say our points are... are... no longer going to be accepted.
"
16,11,Chief,"I knew one day it would come to this.
"
16,11,Patty,"To what? What does this mean?
"
16,11,Chief,"The haoles are trying to do away with us.
"
16,11,Resident 1,"With no rewards program, there will be no distinction between who's a native to this island and who isn't!
"
16,11,Resident 2,"Why can't you people respect our island? Why do you always want nore?!
"
16,11,Chief,"I'm sorry keiki, your hapa noa will have to wait! For we must unite together as never before! It is time to show the haoles that this is our island! 
"
16,11,Chief,"Stop ruining our island, haoles! FIRE! 
"
16,11,First Mate,"What are they doing? 
"
16,11,Chief,"Take a swing! Let them know they are not welcome!
"
16,11,Butters,"I've never done this before. 
"
16,11,Chief,"It's all right. Just try to tap into that anger that's inside you.
"
16,11,Butters,"Aim... my anger! Stupid  Ben Affleck!  Waaah! 
"
16,11,Man,"Hold on!  Hold on!
"
16,11,Woman,"Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!
"
16,11,Man,"I love you! I love you!
"
16,11,Woman,"No! I love you! I love you back! 
"
16,11,Announcer,"This is breaking news!
"
16,11,Anchor,"An insurrection in the Hawaiian Islands has escalated to war! After sinking a cruise ship, the natives of Kauai continue to go berserk, forcing all tourists off their island.
"
16,11,Man 1,"They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore!
"
16,11,Woman 1,"Then a little boy called me a skank.
"
16,11,Anchor,"The President says he will send the Coast Guard to take the island back, though he sympathizes, being a native Hawaiian himself.  Hm.
"
16,11,Chief,"Are all the tourists gone from our island?
"
16,11,Resident 3,"All but a few who are hiding out at Duke's Restaurant. We sent Bob and Trisha Turner to smoke them out.
"
16,11,Resident 4,"What about him?
"
16,11,Kenny,"(What about me?)
"
16,11,Resident 4,"He's a tourist and he knows everything! We have to kill him!
"
16,11,Butters,"No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
"
16,11,Chief,"Be careful young keiki, your anger still controls you because we were not able to finish the ceremony. Perhaps we should finish it now.
"
16,11,Resident 4,"Finish his ceremony?! We are at war, David! I have lived on this island for ten years. Ten years! Every July and part of August! And I can tell you all that what we are about to face from the haoles is nothing short of genocide!
"
16,11,Resident 5,"He's right, David. We can't trust any tourists.
"
16,11,Butters,"He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!
"
16,11,Kenny,"(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)
"
16,11,Resident 6,"Then let him prove himself! Trial by opahika'a!
"
16,11,Chief David,"He's only a child!
"
16,11,Resident 4,"If he wants to be one of us, then he must face the challenge!
"
16,11,Chief David,"Very well. 
"
16,11,Blond Man,"This isn't right! He's not a native! He's gonna get killed!
"
16,11,Butters,"Kenny, be careful!
"
16,11,Chief David,"Quiet. He must face this challenge alone. 
"
16,11,Resident 1,"By the gods! Perhaps he has the heart of a native after all!
"
16,11,Resident 4,"He still has yet to make the turn! 
"
16,11,Residents,"Hohhh!
"
16,11,Resident 7,"That's pretty good. 
"
16,11,Kenny,"(Whoops!)
"
16,11,Butters,"Kenny!
"
16,11,Residents,"Awwwww. 
"
16,11,Resident 4,"I told you a haole couldn't do it!
"
16,11,Chief David,"Did you make the turn your first try? Did any of us? 
"
16,11,Resident 8,"Don't worry, Butters, your friend will find a way back to his kind. The gods will protect him. 
"
16,11,Chief David,"We have called for this great meeting because if we are to survive this war, all the native Hawaiian tribes must join as one!
"
16,11,Resident 9,"We're not joining the people of the Hyatt Grand Vacations! They have no rights to call themselves natives!
"
16,11,Vacationer 1,"Oh and you do?! Your ancestors came on an airplane six months ago! Our ancestors sailed here! On a cruise ship! Nine months ago!
"
16,11,Chief David,"Look, if we are to fight the haoles, we have to allow all natives to say!
"
16,11,Canyoner,"It doesn't matter how many tribes we have, we can't win! We are but a few against the haole's military might! We may have passion, but passion does not win wars!
"
16,11,Chief David,"Oh no? Come up here, keiki. Come on.  This child sunk a cruise ship by himself! Tell them keiki. 
"
16,11,Butters,"Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
"
16,11,Resident 9,"Yeah!
"
16,11,Vacationer 1,"Screw them!
"
16,11,Butters,"Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
"
16,11,Chief David,"Let us make a pact with more chi-chis!
"
16,11,Resident 10,"Um, we're... we're out of chi-chis.
"
16,11,Resident 11,"Oh, right, we've closed off all the ports.
"
16,11,Resident 12,"But they're still letting vodka through, right? Uh... they can't cut off our chi-chis.
"
16,11,Chief David,"...Oh my God.
"
16,11,Captain,"This is the U.S. Coast Guard! We have instructions to take you by force, if necessary!
"
16,11,Chief David,"Ready? Fire! 
"
16,11,Captain,"Fire. 
"
16,11,Chief David,"Arm the bocce balls! 
"
16,11,Captain,"God damn it.
"
16,11,Chief David,"Keep fighting! Stand your ground!
"
16,11,Resident 4,"We can't fight without chi-chis!
"
16,11,Chief David,"You can and you MUST!
"
16,11,Butters,"Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!
"
16,11,The King,"Come on, come on.  You know what chi-chis are, right?
"
16,11,Chief David,"Listen everyone, we gave it all we had. It's over. We must go down to Nowiliwili Harbor, and surrender to the American government.
"
16,11,Butters,"Surrender?! No, the heck with that!
"
16,11,Resident 4,"We can't hold out here any longer!
"
16,11,Butters,"Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
"
16,11,Chief David,"Young keiki, try to control your anger.
"
16,11,Butters,"No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
"
16,11,Resident 13,"Everyone! Look, I say! 
"
16,11,Resident 14,"The haole did it!
"
16,11,Kenny,"My dear friends of the mainland,
What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.
"
16,11,Chief David,"We are not surrendering today! Go back and tell your leaders that we will fight them until the end! 
"
16,11,Captain,"You people just don't give up, do ya?
"
16,11,Kenny,"The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.
"
16,11,Kenny,"With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.
"
16,11,Chief David,"And so it is with great honor that we recognize these two natives with their hapa noa. Take your cards, boys.  Apuiloa hapnanoaha! Hapa'a'a hohaaa!  It's finally over, young keiki. Is your anger at rest?
"
16,11,Butters,"Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
"
16,11,Resident 15,"Ben Affleck isn't with Jennifer Lopez anymore, he's married to Jennifer Gardner.
"
16,11,Residents,"Yeah, it's true, uh huh.
"
16,11,Butters,"What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 
"
16,11,Kenny,"(You do?)
"
16,11,Butters,"Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
"
16,12,Randy,"Hellooo family!  Who wants champagne? 
"
16,12,Sharon,"Randy, what is all this? 
"
16,12,Randy,"It's finally happened, Sharon!  I did it!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.
"
16,12,Sharon,"Oho, Randy, it's beautiful!
"
16,12,Randy,"And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.
"
16,12,Stan,"We're rich?
"
16,12,Shelly,"Finally.
"
16,12,Sharon,"Randy, are you being serious? 
"
16,12,Randy,"I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! 
"
16,12,Stan,"Blockbuster Video?
"
16,12,Randy,"Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?
"
16,12,Randy,"You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
"
16,12,Sharon,"I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.
"
16,12,Randy,"Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?
"
16,12,Stan,"Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. 
"
16,12,Randy,"Well? There she is.  It's a new beginning for us! 
"
16,12,Shelly,"I don't wanna go in there.
"
16,12,Randy,"Shelly come on!
"
16,12,Randy,"Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?
"
16,12,Stan,"It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
"
16,12,Randy,"Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.
"
16,12,Sharon,"I didn't say anything.
"
16,12,Randy,"You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.
"
16,12,Randy,"How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?
"
16,12,Shelly,"Six.  We still, have, SIX. 
"
16,12,Randy,"Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.
"
16,12,Boy,"Go get it, Fillmore! 
"
16,12,Fillmore,"No way, I ain't goin' nere that place. Yeeeyou go get it. 
"
16,12,Randy,"Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?
"
16,12,Boy,"What's he talkin' about rentin' a divadee?
"
16,12,Randy,"Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore!  People just don't know we're open yet!
"
16,12,Fillmore and Friend,"AAAAAH! 
"
16,12,Randy,"Little fucking pricks. 
"
16,12,Randy,"Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something?
"
16,12,Shopper,"I can't find...  Turner & Hooch.  Where's Turner & Hooch?
"
16,12,Randy,"Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-
"
16,12,Shopper,"Aahh... 
"
16,12,Randy,"Oh. Oh I get it!  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!
"
16,12,Ghost,"Emily?  Emily, the war is over! Let's go rent a movie at Blockbuster!
"
16,12,Randy,"Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!
"
16,12,Ghost,"The hounds are calling, Emily. Let's rent something now! 
"
16,12,Randy,"I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!
"
16,12,Ghost,"The hounds, Emily! The hounds!
"
16,12,Randy,"Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  ""Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!""  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!
"
16,12,Stan,"I think something might be wrong with Dad?
"
16,12,Sharon,"Ya think? 
"
16,12,Butters,"Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
"
16,12,Cartman,"We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
"
16,12,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
16,12,Cartman,"Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
"
16,12,Butters,"I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
"
16,12,Jimmy,"Wop. Wop, Wop wop, Wopwop Gangnam Style. 
"
16,12,Cartman,"Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
"
16,12,Butters,"Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
"
16,12,Cartman,"You'll just have to wait and see.
"
16,12,Sharon,"I think that's good. Feel tight enough?
"
16,12,Stan,"Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.
"
16,12,Sharon,"Let's see the shield.
"
16,12,Stan,"Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!
"
16,12,Sharon,"Yehay!
"
16,12,Randy,"Hey, whoa, what are you doing?
"
16,12,Sharon,"Stan's about to go out with his friends.
"
16,12,Randy,"Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night!
"
16,12,Sharon,"For what?!
"
16,12,Randy,"Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!
"
16,12,Shelly,"God I hate this family!
"
16,12,Sharon,"Randy, let him go trick-or-treating.
"
16,12,Randy,"You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing  and candy corn . This is the night we turn it all around.
"
16,12,Stan,"Dad, nobody's gonna come.
"
16,12,Randy,"Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!
"
16,12,Stan,"Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
"
16,12,Randy,"Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!
"
16,12,Stan,"I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!
"
16,12,Kyle,"Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
"
16,12,Stan,"I know, but there's nothing I can do.
"
16,12,Kyle,"But what about the costume contest?!
"
16,12,Kenny,"What's going on, Kyle?
"
16,12,Kyle,"Stan can't come.
"
16,12,Cartman,"Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!
"
16,12,Stan,"I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
"
16,12,Kyle,"Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
"
16,12,Stan,"No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
"
16,12,Randy,"Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! 
"
16,12,Stan,"Oh never mind, I hate him again.
"
16,12,Kyle,"Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
"
16,12,Stan,"Yeah.
"
16,12,Kyle,"Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
"
16,12,Kyle,"All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?
"
16,12,Stan,"How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
"
16,12,Cartman,"This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
"
16,12,Kyle,"He looks fine.
"
16,12,Stan,"Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.
"
16,12,Cartman,"Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, ""Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"" 
"
16,12,The Boys,"Trick or treat.
"
16,12,Stan,"Trick or treat.
"
16,12,Man 1,"Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch. 
"
16,12,Cartman,"I'm not Bruce Vilanch!
"
16,12,Man 1,"Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh  oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh... 
"
16,12,Cartman,"The Incredible...
"
16,12,Man 1,"Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? Dancing with the Stars? The fat transsexual?
"
16,12,Woman 1,"Ohhh, cute!
"
16,12,Cartman,"No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
"
16,12,Woman 1,"The incredible Harvey Fierstein?
"
16,12,Man 1,"Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green.
"
16,12,Cartman,"The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
"
16,12,Man 1,"The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?
"
16,12,Cartman,"JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! 
"
16,12,The Boys,"Trick or treat.
"
16,12,Man 2,"Ohh wow, it's the Avengers!
"
16,12,Cartman,"That's right!
"
16,12,Man 2,"Oho, and Honey Boo Boo!  Kids, come see the green Honey Boo Boo costume!
"
16,12,Girlfriend,"Oh, it's getting colder out.
"
16,12,Boyfriend,"Yeah, you can definitely tell that winter's coming.  What's the matter?
"
16,12,Girlfriend,"That old creepy place. I saw someone in the window there. 
"
16,12,Boyfriend,"Come on, let's get out of here. 
"
16,12,Randy,"They'll come!  Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
"
16,12,Randy,"Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?!  It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies!  What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple.  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!
"
16,12,Ghost 2,"Of course, Mr. Marsh. What'll it be?
"
16,12,Randy,"I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
"
16,12,Ghost 2,"Coming right up. 
"
16,12,Randy,"No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.
"
16,12,Ghost 2,"Your son and wife don't seem to quite agree with you about the video store. In fact, your son seems to think video stores are... as ancient as Madonna's boobs?
"
16,12,Randy,"He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
"
16,12,Ghost 2,"If I may say so, Mr. Marsh, your Blockbuster will never get any customers with those two Negative Nancys sabotaging you. You may need to do something... rather extreme.  If I may say so, Mr. Marsh. 
"
16,12,Stan,"Trick or treat.
"
16,12,Ghost 2,"You are the owner of Blockbuster, Mr. Marsh.  You must be willing to do anything.
"
16,12,Randy,"No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan. 
"
16,12,Kyle,"We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
"
16,12,Cartman,"Dude dude dude! Check it out. 
"
16,12,Stan,"What? What's he doing?
"
16,12,Kyle,"Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
"
16,12,Cartman,"You guys, we've gotta stop it!
"
16,12,Kyle,"Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!
"
16,12,Stan,"Hey, where did you guys go?
"
16,12,Kyle,"Oh, sorry dude.
"
16,12,Stan,"All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
"
16,12,Kenny,"Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.
"
16,12,Cartman,"Cartman SMASH! 
"
16,12,Robber 1,"All right, the camera's out. Hurry up, you two! 
"
16,12,Robber 2,"What the? You told me these things were full of money!
"
16,12,Robber 3,"It's Halloween. I thought everyone would be renting spooky movies. 
"
16,12,Kyle,"For Odin! For Asgard!
"
16,12,Robber 4,"Who are you?!
"
16,12,Cartman,"Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.
"
16,12,Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
16,12,Kenny,"Dude, fuck this. Let's bail! 
"
16,12,Robber 4,"Get 'em!
"
16,12,Sharon,"Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable.  No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in?  You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home.  No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really?  Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen.  Can I help you with something?
"
16,12,Randy,"According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. 
"
16,12,Sharon,"Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy.  Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.
"
16,12,Robber 1,"God damn it those kids saw us! And you let them get away!
"
16,12,Robber 3,"It was the Avengers, Brad! 
"
16,12,Robber 2,"Hey, we caught one of them. We got him tied up in the back. 
"
16,12,Robber 1,"All right, who were your friends?
"
16,12,Stan,"Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
"
16,12,Robber 2,"He's lying. They saw everything!
"
16,12,Robber 1,"Let's try this again. 
"
16,12,Stan,"No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt
"
16,12,Robber 4,"Hey, one of them dropped this.  It's an invitation to a Monster Mash at the community center.
"
16,12,Stan,"No no! We weren't gonna go there!
"
16,12,Robber 1,"Sure you weren't!  Get rid of him!
"
16,12,Stan,"NO!  I won't say anything, I promise! 
"
16,12,Stan,"What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!
"
16,12,Robber 3,"Sorry, kid. End of the line. 
"
16,12,Stan,"What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
"
16,12,Shelly,"I can't find it. Somebody took it.
"
16,12,Sharon,"All right Randy, where are the car keys?!  Randy, where are the keys to the car?!  God damn it! 
"
16,12,Boyfriend,"Did you have fun at the Halloween party?
"
16,12,Girlfriend,"I did. Thanks so much, Ben. And thanks for walking me home. 
"
16,12,Ben,"What's the matter?
"
16,12,Girlfriend,"What is that? 
"
16,12,Ben,"Whaht is what?
"
16,12,Girlfriend,"Somebody dumped a... Oh my God, Ben, it's a little boy!  Hello?  Are you okay? Little boy?
"
16,12,Stan,"Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
"
16,12,Girlfriend,"It's okay. Try and stay calm.
"
16,12,Stan,"Oh, ah thank God you found me.
"
16,12,Ben,"What is he doing way out here?
"
16,12,Stan,"You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! 
"
16,12,Kyle,"And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
"
16,12,Sgt. Yates,"Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes.
"
16,12,Cartman,"Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
"
16,12,Sgt. Yates,"Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed?
"
16,12,Officer,"Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything.
"
16,12,Stan,"They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
"
16,12,Kyle,"Stan! 
"
16,12,Stan,"Guys, you're okay!
"
16,12,Kyle,"What happened to you?
"
16,12,Stan,"It's all right, just a scratch.
"
16,12,Cartman,"Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
"
16,12,Stan,"No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.
"
16,12,Sgt. Yates,"What?! Are you crazy?! We can't cancel the Monster Mash, it's Halloween Night! It's the Monster Mash's biggest night of the year!
"
16,12,Officer 2,"The Monster Mash is only on Halloween. 
"
16,12,Kyle,"Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
"
16,12,Stan,"Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.
"
16,12,Sgt. Yates,"How many people at the Monster Mash?
"
16,12,Officer 3,"Most of the town, sir. It's a graveyard smash.
"
16,12,Officer 4,"Look, whatever we do, we'd better hurry. It gets on in a flash.
"
16,12,Sgt. Yates,"You boys say you can identify the Red Box thieves?
"
16,12,Kenny,"Yes. We saw their faces.
"
16,12,Sgt. Yates,"All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise.
"
16,12,Butters,"That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
"
16,12,Stan,"Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
"
16,12,Butters,"Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. 
"
16,12,Stan,"Oops.
"
16,12,Man 3,"Gaaah!
"
16,12,Stan,"Hey, be careful in there.
"
16,12,Officer 3,"Sorry. I can't see a thing in here.
"
16,12,Stan,"It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
"
16,12,A Banana,"Wow, Gangnamstein. I wish I'd have thought of that.
"
16,12,Randy,"Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?
"
16,12,Shelly,"Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. 
"
16,12,Randy,"Okay.  STAN!  STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'!
"
16,12,Mr. Mackey,"Hokay everyone, it's time to start the costume contest. m'kay.
"
16,12,Stan,"Wait a minute. There they are!
"
16,12,Mr. Garrison,"There's who? 
"
16,12,Stan,"Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- 
"
16,12,Randy,"Who are you people?! You aren't real!
"
16,12,Officer 3,"Hey hay, I can't see! Where do I go? 
"
16,12,Randy,"Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  I got a little somethin' for all of you!  Run! You'd better run!
"
16,12,Randy,"Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!

16,12,Randy,"Arrrg!  Hey, what are you doing?!
"
16,12,Stan,"It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! 
"
16,12,Sgt. Yates,"We got the sonofabitch!
"
16,12,Officer 5,"Wait, wasn't that Peterson in there? 
"
16,12,Sgt. Yates,"Well, I hope you guys have learned that crime doesn't pay.
"
16,12,Robber 1,"Not with the convenience of online streaming it don't.
"
16,12,Butters,"Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. 
"
16,12,Kyle,"Stan?
"
16,12,Stan,"Hey dude.
"
16,12,Kyle,"The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
"
16,12,Stan,"It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
"
16,12,Kyle,"You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
"
16,12,Stan,"Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
"
16,12,Kenny,"Yeah, Stan?
"
16,12,Stan,"Stay gold. 
"
16,12,Randy,"Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan!  Stan! 
"
16,12,Sharon,"I spoke with the insurance company.  They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?
"
16,12,Randy,"No...
"
16,12,Sharon,"You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?
"
16,12,Randy,"Yeah...
"
16,12,Sharon,"You want me to bring you some McDonald's?
"
16,12,Randy,"Okay...
"
16,12,Sharon,"What do you want from McDonald's?
"
16,12,Randy,"Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. 
"
16,13,Pharmacist,"Next please.  You are sure you want to do this?
"
16,13,Man,"Of course I'm sure!
"
16,13,Pharmacist,"Okay, roll up your sleeve. 
"
16,13,Cartman,"I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
"
16,13,Clyde,"Lying jerk! 
"
16,13,Pharmacist,"Hold still please.
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! 
"
16,13,Cartman,"All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! 
"
16,13,Man 2,"All right, I'm next! I'm next! Get this thing off of me! 
"
16,13,Kyle,"Did you do it?
"
16,13,Cartman,"Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
"
16,13,Kenny,"(I told you it was a bad idea.)
"
16,13,Cartman,"Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?
"
16,13,Randy,"Oh I feel like such an idiot.
"
16,13,Stan,"It's all right, Dad.
"
16,13,Randy,"But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today.
"
16,13,Anchor,"These latest tests are once again confirming that the performance-enhancing drug HGH was in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. All over the country people are having their ""What Would Jesus Do"" wristbands cut off. It was just last week a team of scientists found traces of HGH on the Shroud of Turin  , along with several other illegal compounds and painkillers. 
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"Without a doubt there was uh HGH in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. Jesus did not suffer for our sins, he was in fact very high.
"
16,13,Randy,"All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
"
16,13,Anchor,"Priests and bishops have been working overtime to remove Jesus from the record books and from The Last Supper. 
"
16,13,Randy,"I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. 
"
16,13,Butters,"Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, ""Well, what about the New Testament?""
"
16,13,Cartman,"Uh huh.
"
16,13,Butters,"And he says, ""Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up.""
"
16,13,Cartman,"So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet!
"
16,13,Stan,"All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
"
16,13,Cartman,"The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
"
16,13,Butters,"Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
"
16,13,Stan,"Yeah I know.
"
16,13,Cartman,"Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Wuughhhuh. Where do I go? What do I do?
"
16,13,Craig,"Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet.
"
16,13,Stan,"Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
"
16,13,Announcer,"It's the Charlie Rose show. Here's Chuck.
"
16,13,Charlie Rose,"We are here tonight with the only person in America who still wears his ""What Would Jesus Do"" wristband. Please welcome Stan Marsh.
"
16,13,A Voice,"Dick! 
"
16,13,Charlie Rose,"Stan, after everything that's come out, after all the facts have been proven, why do you still wear the wristband?
"
16,13,Stan,"I don't know,  I just like it.
"
16,13,Charlie Rose,"You just like it.
"
16,13,Stan,"Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.
"
16,13,Charlie Rose,"Well joining us now is just one of the billions of people who think that anyone who still wears their ""What Would Jesus Do"" wristband is doing all of society a disservice. Chris Martin you say that Stan Marsh is... a dick?
"
16,13,Chris Martin,"Yeah, yeah, thanks Charlie. My problem with this kid is he doesn't care about the truth! Okay, if Jesus rose from the dead with the help of drugs, that's fine, but then he went on to say it was a miracle, and that is where it became dangerous! What about the Incas?! What about the Aztecs?! Millions of people who were murdered in Jesus's name, and then Jesus turns out to be a fraud! Wearing that bracelet is a slap in the face to everyone!
"
16,13,Charlie Rose,"What do you say about that, Stan?
"
16,13,Stan,"...I don't know.  I like it.
"
16,13,Charlie Rose,"All right, well we searched high and low to find my next guest who actually agrees with Stan Marsh, and thinks he's doing the right thing. Please welcome a retarded fish.  Now, Retarded Fish, you don't see any problem at all with someone keeping their bracelet 
"
16,13,Chris Martin,"That that's because, that's because you're a retarded fish, and you don't know any better! What about the Crusades?! The Inquisitions?! How many people were tortured to death for somebody who is a fake?! 
"
16,13,Charlie Rose,"What about the Crusades, Stan? Soes that enter into your decision at all?
"
16,13,Stan,"No, I just, I don' know. No.
"
16,13,Charlie Rose,"Anything to add, Retarded Fish?
"
16,13,Retarded Fish,"Nnno, No, I'm good. Thank you.
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Stan! Hey Stan, can I talk to you?  Listen, Stan, ah I just wanna tell you... You've really been an inspiration m'kay?
"
16,13,Stan,"I have?
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah. You know, I can't believe in Jesus anymore, 'cause he's a damned fraud, so what I'm gonna believe in is just bein' me, and bein' independent like you. So what I did is I got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground, uhkay? And just believin' in the cause of bein' me.
"
16,13,Stan,"You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Oh I'm not the only one. There's lost of people doin' it.  Hey Butters. Stand ground.
"
16,13,Butters,"Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! 
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Anyway, thanks Stan. And... you know, just keep on, keep on standing your ground, okay? 
"
16,13,Stan,"You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?
"
16,13,Butters,"Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 
"
16,13,Stan,"...Farmers in where?
"
16,13,Worker,"Move aside, farmers! This land is no longer yours!
"
16,13,Farmer,"We will not move aside! We will stand our ground!  Like the child on the Charlie Rose show! 
"
16,13,Stan,"Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
"
16,13,Butters,"I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 
"
16,13,Clerk,"Hello, you interested in the Stanground braceleh-OH! Wow, it's you!  Stanground, brah!
"
16,13,Stan,"Wow, this is happening so fast.
"
16,13,Steve Nelson,"Hello Stan, Steve Nelson with Endorsement Management. Are you ready for your Nike commercial? 
"
16,13,Stan,"My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.
"
16,13,Waiter,"Would you like to be seated?
"
16,13,Stan,"No thanks. I'll stand.
"
16,13,Moviegoer,"Hey, you wanna siddown?
"
16,13,Stan,"I'm good.
"
16,13,Flight Attendant,"Sir, the captain has asked everyone to take their seats.
"
16,13,Stan,"Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, ""You never took the bracelet off? Not once?""  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground. 
"
16,13,Mr. Garrison,"Now, when Dr. Drew told Jeff Conway he was on a one-way street to nowhere, what tactics did he use to try and convince-? 
"
16,13,Lawyer,"Mr. Marsh, if you don't mine, we'd like to see your bracelet.
"
16,13,Stan,"For what?
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"If you have nothing to hide, then please hand it over, Mr. Marsh.
"
16,13,Kyle,"What are you people talking about?
"
16,13,Field Reporter,"Are we good? We live? Tom, I'm here at South Park Elementary, where officials have barged their way in after reports of Stan Marsh of the Stanground Foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet. Rumors have surfaced that Stan did not stan his ground as previously stated, and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together.
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"Please let us check your wristband for superglue.
"
16,13,Stan,"No! This is stupid!
"
16,13,Butters,"He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"Are you afraid we might find glue on your bracelet, Mr. Marsh?
"
16,13,Stan,"No! I never cut if off!
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"Then, let us ah-see it.
"
16,13,Jimmy,"This is an outrage! Who out there is saying that our friend Stan is a liar?
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"I cannot say, but he is a reliable and credible source who is of the utmost prestige.
"
16,13,Butters,"Who?
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"All right, it was Craig. 
"
16,13,Cartman,"Craig?! You asshole!
"
16,13,Stan,"What's the big idea, Craig?!
"
16,13,Craig,"It just looked like you cut it off, that's all.
"
16,13,Stan,"You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
"
16,13,Butters,"Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
"
16,13,The Class,"Yeah!
"
16,13,Stan,"You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
"
16,13,Butters,"Go Stan!
"
16,13,Stan,"And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
"
16,13,Butters,"...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!
"
16,13,Stan,"Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
"
16,13,The Class,"Yeah!
"
16,13,Butters,"Prostitute!
"
16,13,Announcer,"This is breaking news.
"
16,13,Anchor,"The tests are done and the results are in. The little boy who claimed he never cut off his ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet did cut it off, and lied about it.
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"Not only did we find traces of ah-superglue, but of yellow magic ah-markeur as well. This is a dark ah-day for honest French-Swedish people everywheure.
"
16,13,Anchor,"Though the tests seem conclusive, Stan Marsh continues to deny any cheating.
"
16,13,Stan,"Yeah. 
"
16,13,Kyle,"Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
"
16,13,Stan,"Thanks Kyle.
"
16,13,Kyle,"You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
"
16,13,Stan,"Why does it matter?!
"
16,13,Kyle,"Because you kind of made it matter.
"
16,13,Stan,"You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
"
16,13,Kyle,"S-so you did superglue it.
"
16,13,Stan,"Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!
"
16,13,Kyle,"Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
"
16,13,Stan,"You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!
"
16,13,Wife,"Would you mind getting me some water, darling?
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"Can't you see I'm trying to do ah-my calisthenics?
"
16,13,Wife,"But my throat is parched, dear, and I'm so scared of burglars.
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"Is ah-tap water going to be okay, or do you want me to go down to Crystal Geyser and bring Her Highness some right from the spring?
"
16,13,Wife,"Tap is fine, dear. 
"
16,13,Wife,"What was that? I could have sworn I saw something outside.
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"It's ah-your imagination
"
16,13,Wife,"Oh darling, could you change the channel for me? The remote is dead. 
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"You just want me to change the channel or should I go and make a TV program written ah-just for you?!
"
16,13,Wife,"No, just change to channel 10, thanks.
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"It's ah-starting to feel like ah-The Carole Burnett Show in here. 
"
16,13,Wife,"What was that?! I think somebody's here!
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"Maybe it's ah-the peepee fairy so somebody can ah-take a peepee for you too.
"
16,13,Wife,"Please I'm terrified. Please go check it out. 
"
16,13,Stan,"Jesus!
"
16,13,Jesus,"Shhhh.
"
16,13,Stan,"What are you doing here?
"
16,13,Jesus,"My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use...
"
16,13,Stan and Jesus,"...to discredit him too.
"
16,13,Jesus,"That's what I'm doing. 
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"Oh, it's ah-Tweedle Dumb and ah-Tweedle Dee trying to break in-ah-to my house!
"
16,13,Stan,"Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
"
16,13,Jesus,"Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son.
"
16,13,Stan,"Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"Ah-excuse me, I'm sorry to intrude, but do you want to please ah-leave or should I make you some kofel bread and ah-sausages?!
"
16,13,Stan,"It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
"
16,13,Jesus,"Yeah, I know how it goes.
"
16,13,Stan,"Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
"
16,13,Jesus,"I know. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud.
"
16,13,Lead Scientist,"Here you go, kofel bread and some sausage for you.
"
16,13,Stan,"Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?
"
16,13,Jesus,"NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son?
"
16,13,Stan,"NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
"
16,13,Jesus,"Pff, I know, right?
"
16,13,Stan,"Pff it's like, that's here  and...
"
16,13,Jesus,"Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here. 
"
16,13,Stan,"Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
"
16,13,Jesus,"P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos?
"
16,13,Stan,"Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
"
16,13,Jesus,"Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again!
"
16,13,Stan,"How can we raise awareness?
"
16,13,Jesus,"We need to get some bracelets.
"
16,13,P.F. Pityef,"Welcome, welcome, to the P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory. How can I be of service?
"
16,13,Stan,"Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
"
16,13,P.F. Pityef,"Ah, I see you're wearing one of our brown scauses already. Delightful. What color would you like your new scause to be?
"
16,13,Stan,"Our... scause?
"
16,13,P.F. Pityef,"Well of course! You came for a scause to wear on your paws. And you want others to wear yours upon thaurs.
"
16,13,Jesus,"I'm confused.
"
16,13,P.F. Pityef,"Hm. Perhaps I should start from the beginning. 
In the modern age there are those who believe
That a cause is a thing to be worn on one's sleeve. 
And so, we sell a cause. It's called a scause.
And wearing a scause gets you lots of applause. 
We start with some plastic which is shirped by our shirpist
Then dip it in colors that show off your purpose.
There are green scauses for recycling, blue scauses for kitties, 
And pink scauses that focus on nothing but titties. 
Do you hate abortion? Ah! Then a white scause is for you! 
Why not champion your scause with some sparkles and glue?
We make scauses for this! We make scauses for that! 
Why there's even a scause for just being fat! 
What's the matter? Can't think of a scause? 
How about raising awareness for the hairs in your schnozz?
Let's just think of the thing that you care about most. 
Then let's make it orange, like marmalade toast!
And now I'd like to say ""thank you"" for your coming down.
I'm off to go sell these in your little town!
"
16,13,Stan,"Dude, the hell just happen?
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Kids? Kids, okay, I need to talk to you about a serious matter.  You probably all noticed my orange wristband , mkay? It's to show my solidarity with the people of Belarus.  Mkay, you should know that the Belarusian government is right now trying to-
"
16,13,Craig,"We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too. 
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Oh you do? Ya you got you got those? Okay, okay, that's good! Good you're doin' something about it, m'kay.  Uh hey kids. Kids over here...
"
16,13,Cartman,"Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
"
16,13,Clyde,"There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.
"
16,13,Cartman,"Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
"
16,13,Clyde,"Yes you do. 
"
16,13,Cartman,"...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
"
16,13,Butters,"Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
"
16,13,Stan,"People are saying that? 
"
16,13,Butters,"Yeeah. Is it true?
"
16,13,Stan,"Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
"
16,13,Butters,"Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
"
16,13,Stan,"We did it. 
"
16,13,Anchor,"It has become the biggest concern for most people. The farmers of Belarus and their plight against their government. And now one person is taking it upon himself to end the crisis. His name? Jesus.
"
16,13,Jesus,"These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can.
"
16,13,Field Reporter,"Jesus, some people might be thinking you're doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use?
"
16,13,Jesus,"You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out. 
"
16,13,Farmers,"AAAAH!! 
"
16,13,Jesus,"You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarrus need my help.
"
16,13,Field Reporter,"Ah I believe it's Belarus, Jesus.
"
16,13,Jesus,"Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now. 
"
16,13,Field Reporter,"Um, so you think you've something here to keep the conflict from escalating, is that right?
"
16,13,Jesus,"I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarrus busting my ass! What are you on?!
"
16,13,Field Reporter,"Uh huh, and now that the Belarusian farmers are all dead, what will you try next?
"
16,13,Jesus,"What?  Aw, shit!
"
16,13,P.F. Pityef,"One at a time, please. One at a time.
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Look, I want to return this orange bracelet, m'kay?!  It's worthless now!
"
16,13,P.F. Pityef,"Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I'll give you two more!
"
16,13,Cartman,"Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.
"
16,13,P.F. Pityef,"Absolutely! Five dollars please.
"
16,13,Kyle,"Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
"
16,13,Stan,"Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! 
"
16,13,P.F. Pityef,"Oh my, it's the sound!
"
16,13,Butters,"Wu-what sound?
"
16,13,P.F. Pityef,"Of all sounds in all sounddom this one's most profound.  That's the sound that means I must pack up my tent. It's the sound of the last cent being spent.  My work here is done, and just look at you now! You're all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow. Enjoy all your scauses. You look great in your cause. Be sure to give each other lots of applause. I'm off to the next town in my little truck. Have a nice day! Toot a loo!
"
16,13,Cartman,"...Fuck! Dude, weak. 
"
16,13,Stan,"It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
"
16,13,Jesus,"Yeah...
"
16,13,Stan,"We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
"
16,13,Jesus,"Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us.
"
16,13,Stan,"Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
"
16,13,Jesus,"What can we possibly do?
"
16,13,Stan,"What would Jesus do?  Yeheah! 
"
16,13,Jesus,"Vengeance is mine! 
"
16,13,P.F. Pityef,"No please! Please show mercy!
"
16,13,Jesus,"Get out! 
"
16,13,Jesus,"Thank you my children.  We've all been through a lot. We got caught up in scauses... that didn't mean squat. They turned my message away from the teachings it hid, and made it about me and the things that I did. Which of course I didn't do. And even if I did use performance-enhancing drugs, so did all the other prophets. But I didn't. So what have we learned from this great wristband theft? Maybe, that when stripped of our scauses, only causes are left. And causes shouldn't be worn on our wrists with a sneer. Let's keep our causes where they belong, which is  right here. On T-shirts!  Free Pussy Riot! 
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Free Pussy Riot!
"
16,13,The Boys,"Yeah!
"
16,14,Denver Poll Worker,"Okay, Mr. Thompson, voting line is right over there.  Next, please. 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
"
16,14,Denver Poll Worker,"Oh dear, did you lose your mother, little boy?
"
16,14,Cartman,"MOM!
"
16,14,Denver Poll Worker,"Security?
"
16,14,Denver Guard,"Heaah?
"
16,14,Denver Poll Worker,"This little boy lost his mom.
"
16,14,Cartman,"She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
"
16,14,Denver Guard,"It's all right, come on. 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Mom? Where's my mom?
"
16,14,Charlotte Poll Worker,"Oh dear. Did you lose your mommy, little boy?
"
16,14,Flight Attendant 1,"Would you like some warm nuts, sir?
"
16,14,Cartman,"""Warm nuts"", she said.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
"
16,14,Flight Attendant 2,"Warm nuts, sir? Warm nuts?
"
16,14,Cartman,"No way dude. No way.
"
16,14,Cartman,"MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
"
16,14,Flight Attendant 3,"Would you like warm nuts, sir? 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. 
"
16,14,Cartman,"MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
"
16,14,Anchor,"The people have spoken, and the President of the United States is once again, Barack Obama.
"
16,14,President Obama,"I assure you all, I am heading back to the White House more motivated - more titillated - than ever. 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?
"
16,14,Cartman,"Hey Kyle. What's up?
"
16,14,Kyle,"Nothing, watching the election results.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
"
16,14,Kyle,"What?!
"
16,14,Cartman,"Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!
"
16,14,Cartman,"You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
"
16,14,Kyle,"It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Sure you do!
"
16,14,Cartman,"What if I did, Kyle?
"
16,14,Kyle,"Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Pretty sweet, huh?
"
16,14,Kyle,"What the hell is this?
"
16,14,Cartman,"What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
"
16,14,Kyle,"I don't believe it.
"
16,14,Cartman,"No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Why do you have these?
"
16,14,Cartman,"Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Dude!
"
16,14,Cartman,"Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Knock it off, Cartman!
"
16,14,Cartman,"Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
"
16,14,Kyle,"You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
"
16,14,Liane,"Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?
"
16,14,Cartman,"Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
"
16,14,Agent,"Mr. President?
"
16,14,President Obama,"Yes?
"
16,14,Agent,"Line 2 from China for you, sir. It's General Tso.
"
16,14,President Obama,"Yes, hello General.
"
16,14,General Tso,"We assume you are preased with the erection results?
"
16,14,President Obama,"Very pleased. Thank you for your help.
"
16,14,General Tso,"And you no doubt will now begin filling your side of the bargain.
"
16,14,President Obama,"You'll have what you want. I'll meet you in three hours. 
"
16,14,Agent,"Sir, the election may have gone the way they said, but we can't possibly give the Chinese what you promised.
"
16,14,President Obama,"I don't know how they did it, but the Chinese secured my victory. I have to fulfill my obligation.
"
16,14,Agent,"And what if General Tso suddenly gets the courage to go to the press with all this?
"
16,14,President Obama,"Don't worry. Everyone knows General Tso's chicken.
"
16,14,Officer 1,"Eric Cartman? We have a report you might be involved in voter fraud?
"
16,14,Cartman,"Hmmm, no.
"
16,14,Officer 2,"You mind if we search your room?
"
16,14,Cartman,"I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
"
16,14,Kyle,"This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
"
16,14,Officer 1,"Let's just see. 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
"
16,14,Kyle,"Upstairs! First door to the left!
"
16,14,Cartman,"I know my rights! Stop right now! 
"
16,14,Kyle,"But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
"
16,14,Cartman,"I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
"
16,14,Officer 2,"Oh my God, what have we done?
"
16,14,Officer 1,"Guess this country is changing. We're sorry little boy, we're SO sorry. 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
"
16,14,Cartman,"But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
"
16,14,Stan,"Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
"
16,14,Stan,"But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
"
16,14,Stan,"I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
"
16,14,Jimmy,"Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff.
"
16,14,Craig,"Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me.
"
16,14,Kyle,"God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
"
16,14,Butters,"Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Butters, you know something, don't you?!
"
16,14,Butters,"Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?
"
16,14,Kyle,"What did Cartman tell you?!
"
16,14,Butters,"He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
"
16,14,Kyle,"Tell us what you know right now!
"
16,14,Butters,"I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
"
16,14,Stan,"Is that an M&M?
"
16,14,Butters,"It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Then you have to tell us!
"
16,14,Butters,"Well... hah... HWAAAH! 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it! 
"
16,14,Stan,"Pry his mouth open!
"
16,14,Craig,"He ate it!
"
16,14,Stan,"Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
"
16,14,Butters,"Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. 
"
16,14,Waitress,"More melted butter, sir?
"
16,14,Cartman,"Mm, mhm, mhm.
"
16,14,General Tso,"Little boy, the President is on his way to pick up the ballots. Where are they?!
"
16,14,Cartman,"They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
"
16,14,General Tso,"Alter our... The President will be here in moments with what we want!
"
16,14,Cartman,"Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
"
16,14,A Diner,"Oh my God, it's the President! 
"
16,14,President Obama,"Thank you, thank you all for your votes of confidence. If I could... just be a little rude and ask for a nice quiet meal in private?
"
16,14,Diner 1,"Oh, of course. Come on, let's let the President have some peace and quiet. 
"
16,14,Diner 2,"Wow, the President eats at Red Lobster. He's just a normal guy like me.
"
16,14,Diner 3,"Come on guys. President says ""get out."" 
"
16,14,Diner 4,"I didn't actually vote for him. 
"
16,14,President Obama,"All right. Where are the ballots? 
"
16,14,Doctor,"Your friend has had a severe allergic reaction.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Can we please just try and talk to him?
"
16,14,Doctor,"All right, but don't take too long. 
"
16,14,Butters,"What's up fellas?
"
16,14,Kyle,"Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
"
16,14,Butters,"Bleh, ogayedmi.
"
16,14,Kyle,"I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
"
16,14,Butters,"AGH! No! Please! You can't!
"
16,14,Kyle,"Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
"
16,14,Butters,"Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.
"
16,14,Stan,"What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 
"
16,14,Kyle,"What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
"
16,14,Butters,"At Red Robster. 
"
16,14,Kenny,"(At Red Lobster.)
"
16,14,Kyle,"Where?
"
16,14,Butters,"Red Lobster!
"
16,14,Stan,"Huh?
"
16,14,Jimmy,"He said ""at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red""
"
16,14,Butters,"Red Lobster!
"
16,14,Kenny,"(Red Lobster!)
"
16,14,Kyle,"What?
"
16,14,Jimmy,"Ruh Rehh... Red
"
16,14,Butters,"Red Lobster!
"
16,14,Kenny,"(Red Lobster!)
"
16,14,Stan,"Oh, Red Lobster.
"
16,14,President Obama,"General Tso, do you have the missing ballots or not?
"
16,14,General Tso,"Sssure, we have the ballots, but we don't have them right here with us now. 
"
16,14,President Obama,"Okay, you want me to come in again, we can start over, what the fuck is this?!
"
16,14,Kyle,"All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?
"
16,14,Cartman,"Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
"
16,14,General Tso,"Mr. President, we got you reelected! Now you will give us the Star Wars technology so that we can make the sequels!
"
16,14,President Obama,"I told you China would get the rights to Star Wars from Disney as long as my Presidency was secure!  Until I have those ballots  it is not secure!
"
16,14,Kyle,"Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!
"
16,14,Morgan Freeman,"What's going on is the sale of America's greatest asset.  You see, when the United States created Star Wars it made this country incredibly powerful.
"
16,14,General Tso,"Morgan Freeman?
"
16,14,Morgan Freeman,"Earlier this week, Lucas signed the rights to Star Wars over to Disney, and the Chinese saw a way to obtain it for themselves. The Chinese government knew that President Obama would help them take the rights from Disney if they helped him get reelected.
"
16,14,Craig,"Ohhhh.
"
16,14,Morgan Freeman,"But the child who actually stole the ballots has hidden them, and won't give them to anyone until his demands are met. You've all got quite a mess on your hands. I wish you well with it. 
"
16,14,Stan,"Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?
"
16,14,Morgan Freeman,"Because every time I show up and explain something, I earn a freckle. 
"
16,14,Cartman,"So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
"
16,14,General Tso,"That was not the deal! We will not be a-bullied by you!
"
16,14,Cartman,"Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. 
"
16,14,Jimmy,"Heheh, I get it. General Tso's chih-chih-chicken.
"
16,14,Mike,"You are absolutely sure about this?
"
16,14,Agent 2,"It's been confirmed, Mike. My God, we might have won this thing. 
"
16,14,Mike,"Sir? Sir, we have some... incredible news. There are rumors of hundreds of thousands of stolen ballots. You might have won the election after all. 
"
16,14,Stan,"There's nothing here, Kyle. 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Anything in the basement, Jimmy?
"
16,14,Jimmy,"Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos
"
16,14,Kyle,"Well keep looking.
"
16,14,Liane,"Oh my goodness, what's going on?
"
16,14,Kyle,"Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
"
16,14,Liane,"Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?
"
16,14,Stan,"He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
"
16,14,Liane,"Oh well, no TV for him for a few days.
"
16,14,Jimmy,"There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue.
"
16,14,Stan,"Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! 
"
16,14,Mickey Mouse,"Just what the Dickens is going on here, haha?!
"
16,14,Stan,"Aw shit, it's him again.
"
16,14,Mickey Mouse,"What's this about a deal with the Chinese?! I own all this shit now! I own the Death Star! I own Tatooine! It's all MINE, haha! All right fuckers, where are the missing ballots? Haha.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
"
16,14,Butters,"I didn't say anything. I promise.
"
16,14,Cartman,"I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.
"
16,14,Butters,"Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
"
16,14,Cartman,"Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.
"
16,14,Salesman,"Hey guys. Lookin' to buy a Hummer today?  We're havin' a Rocktober sales event day that's goin' into Rockvember.  Hey there! Interested in test-drivin' a Hummer today?  I can see you, with the Ray-Bans, got that nice bicep haning' out the window rolled down, whattaya think?  Rockvember sales event, guys! Every Hummer comes with a free Segway.
"
16,14,Café Monet diner,"Hey why don't you shut up?!
"
16,14,Salesman,"I'm just excited about all these deals, that's all. 
"
16,14,Storm Trooper,"We found him sir, but still no sign of the missing ballots.
"
16,14,Mickey Mouse,"Go on! Leave us alone! Haha.  Now listen, little boy, the reason this country works is because people go out to vote. Every vote counts. And you need-
"
16,14,Cartman,"Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
"
16,14,Mickey Mouse,"Why don't you just tell me where the missing ballots are?! It will make your death a lot less painful! Haha.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
"
16,14,Mickey Mouse,"Pretty neat, huh? How would you like to have one?
"
16,14,Cartman,"I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
"
16,14,Mickey Mouse,"Like what?!
"
16,14,Cartman,"I want a part in the new movies!
"
16,14,Mickey Mouse,"Well then, why didn't you just come to me in the first place? If you wanna be in the next Star Wars, I'm your guy! Haha.
"
16,14,Cartman,"I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
"
16,14,Mickey Mouse,"You can be Luke's son, you can be Han Solo's son, I don't give two shits and a popsicle.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
"
16,14,Mickey Mouse,"Sure thing. I've got tauntauns comin' out my asshole, haha.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Haha.
"
16,14,Mickey Mouse,"Haha.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Haha. 
"
16,14,Wolf Blitzer,"This is Breaking Election News. Hold that phone! The election may be over, but rumors are running rampant that hundreds of thousands of ballots for Mitt Romney were stolen!
"
16,14,Kyle,"We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-
"
16,14,Field Reporter,"And and you claim that a General Tso hired your friend, Fatass, to steal the ballots, but so far the Chinese are refusing to speak with us.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken. 
"
16,14,Field Reporter,"Is that it? Did he just? Did he just?
"
16,14,Wolf Blitzer,"Yup. Chris, we're getting confirmation that was the millionth time.
"
16,14,Chris,"Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time. 
"
16,14,Kyle,"What?
"
16,14,Field Reporter,"Little boy, the General Tso's chicken joke, a favorite for years, you've just hit the magic number, how does it feel?
"
16,14,Kyle,"I... what? 
"
16,14,Field Reporter,"He's being presented with the check now, a five thousand dollar gift certificate to P.F. Chang's.  This has been a long campaign, but someone's finally done it, Wolf.
"
16,14,Stan,"Well, we tried, dude.
"
16,14,Kyle,"It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
"
16,14,Stan,"Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
"
16,14,Kyle,"It matters, Stan. It it matters.
"
16,14,A Santa,"Ho ho ho hoo!  Come on down to Stevenson Hummer for our big Christmas in Humvember Sale!  Not sure what to get your loved one this holiday season? Why not give them a nice Hummer? Nothing beats a Hummer on Christmas morning! 
"
16,14,Stan,"Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?
"
16,14,Stan,"Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?
"
16,14,Kyle,"Oh my God.
"
16,14,Mr. Stevenson,"Hey, looking for a Hummer today? Got some 2009s here. Never been driven. ...Ever.  Go on, get out of here! Shoo! 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Look! There they are!
"
16,14,Mr. Stevenson,"Hey, hi there! You kids like Hummers, huh? Let me show you these babies!
"
16,14,Kyle,"We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us! 
"
16,14,Mr. Stevenson,"Oh hell yes! Asians! Hey guys!
"
16,14,General Tso,"Get out of our way!
"
16,14,Kyle,"No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
"
16,14,General Tso,"I am tired of playing games! This little farce is ovah! 
"
16,14,Cartman,"I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! 
"
16,14,Mr. Stevenson,"Oh my God it's a sales rush! 
"
16,14,Officer 2,"Oh my God. Are those what I think they are?
"
16,14,Cartman,"Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
"
16,14,Officer 3,"Sir, we've found something, at the Hummer sales lot outside of town.
"
16,14,General Tso,"You don't understand. We are trying to protect the greatest film series ever made!
"
16,14,Kyle,"Protect it?
"
16,14,Officer 4,"What the hell is going on here?!
"
16,14,Morgan Freeman,"Perhaps I can explain it to you.  You see, it turns out the only reason the Chinese so desperately wanted Star Wars is because they're afraid that Disney might not be the right place for it. The Chinese simply want to guard Star Wars' impeccable legacy.
"
16,14,Officer 5,"Is that Morgan Freeman?
"
16,14,Morgan Freeman,"And now we're at a crossroads. If these ballots are made public, then the man the people voted for will be President, but he will no doubt keep Star Wars from the Chinese, and allow Disney to keep it instead. And so we have to ask ourselves, ""What's more important? That the right man is elected President, or that Star Wars is with people who will protect it most?"" 
"
16,14,An Officer,"Unit 4, what is it?! Over.
"
16,14,Officer 1,"Well kid?
"
16,14,Kyle,"Well... if you put it that way...
"
16,14,An Officer,"Come in Unite 4! What have you found?!
"
16,14,Officer 1,"Nothing sir. We just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants, that's all. Barkley out. 
"
16,14,Cartman,"No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! 
"
16,14,Group,"Obama is President again. 
"
